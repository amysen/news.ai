SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - A economia do Brasil contraiu mais do que o esperado em agosto, resultado mais fraco em cinco meses e interrompendo dois meses de alta, mas ainda insuficiente para frear o processo de recuperação gradual da atividade.

O Índice de Atividade Econômica do BC (IBC-Br), espécie de sinalizador do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), caiu 0,38 por cento em agosto sobre julho, em dado dessazonalizado. Pesquisa da Reuters com analistas mostrou que a expectativa era de contração de 0,15 por cento.

“Esse resultado não altera nossa expectativa de retomada gradual da atividade econômica. Esperamos ainda uma aceleração da atividade econômica no quarto trimestre, consistente com nossa projeção de uma expansão de 0,9 por cento do PIB neste ano”, informou o banco Bradesco em nota.

O resultado negativo foi o maior desde março, quando o IBC-Br teve contração de 0,40 por cento, e veio após o país ter iniciado o terceiro trimestre com crescimento mensal de 0,36 por cento em julho, em dado revisado pelo BC de alta de 0,41 por cento divulgada inicialmente.

A leitura de agosto tem como pano de fundo resultados fracos tanto da produção industrial quanto das vendas no varejo e do volume de serviços, também considerados pontuais e que não tendem a atrapalhar o ritmo de recuperação dos setores. [nL2N1ME0F9][nL2N1MM0L0][nL2N1MS0D3]

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - T-Mobile US et Sprint comptent annoncer leur fusion sans cessions d‘actifs dans l‘immédiat, les deux groupes de télécommunications comptant négocier ensuite ce point-là avec les autorités de tutelle, ont déclaré dimanche des sources proches du dossier.

Reuters avait rapporté la semaine passée que certains membres du département concurrence du Trésor américain doutaient que cette opération, rapprochant les troisième et quatrième opérateurs télécoms mobiles américains, puisse se faire en l‘état.

T-Mobile US, filiale de Deutsche Telekom, et Sprint, contrôlé par le groupe japonais Softbank, pensent annoncer leur fusion fin octobre ou début novembre et mettre surtout l‘accent sur les avantages qu‘elle comporterait pour le consommateur américain, en particulier dans la promotion de la future technologie 5G, ont expliqué les sources.

T-Mobile et Sprint se sont refusé à tout commentaire.

“Il vaut mieux pour Sprint et T-Mobile apprendre des régulateurs quelles sont leurs préoccupations puis voir comment il est possible d‘y répondre”, dit Craig Moffett, analyste de MoffettNathanson.

L‘entité née de la fusion représenterait plus de 130 millions d‘abonnés, se classant juste derrière Verizon Communications et AT&T.

Son chiffre d‘affaires dépasserait 70 milliards de dollars (58,50 milliards d‘euros) et les analystes estiment très élevé le potentiel de réduction des coûts.

John Hodulik, analyste d‘UBS, estime que la Commission fédérale des Communications (FCC) obligera sans doute les deux opérateurs à céder certaines fréquences car la nouvelle entité aurait le plus grand nombre de fréquences de moins de 300 MHz, devant Verizon et AT&T.

Disposer d‘un large spectre de fréquences est particulièrement important pour développer la 5G, surtout face à la concurrence des services à haut débit des câblo-opérateurs.

Les actionnaires de Sprint ne bénéficieront que d‘une prime modeste, voire inexistante, dans cette fusion, ce qui veut dire que Softbank et d‘autres actionnaires de Sprint auront autour de 40% de la nouvelle structure. Deutsche Telekom et les autres actionnaires de T-Mobile US auront le reste.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it would push the United Nations Security Council to renew within days an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, setting the stage for a likely showdown with Russia.

Russia has questioned the work and future of the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and said it would decide whether to support extending the mandate after investigators submit their next report.

The inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an April 4 attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people.

“We would like to see it renewed prior to the report coming out,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley told reporters.

“The Russians have made it very clear that should the report blame the Syrians suddenly they won’t have faith in the JIM. If the report doesn’t blame the Syrians then they say that they will. We can’t work like that,” Haley said.

A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.

Haley said she would circulate a draft resolution to the 15-member Security Council later on Wednesday to renew the mandate for the JIM, which is due to expire in mid-November. It was unanimously created by the council in 2015 and renewed in 2016.

A resolution must get nine votes in favor and not be vetoed by any of the council’s five permanent members - Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France - in order to pass.

The JIM has found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during a civil war that has lasted more than six years.

Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s non-proliferation and arms control department, said on Friday there were “serious problems” with the work of the inquiry.

“In order to judge if it deserves an extension of the mandate, we need to see the report ... and assess it,” Ulyanov told a briefing at the United Nations to present Moscow’s view on the “Syrian chemical dossier.”","U.S., Russia set for likely U.N. row over Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicalweapons/u-s-russia-set-for-likely-u-n-row-over-syria-toxic-gas-inquiry-idUSKBN1CN29T

TORONTO (Reuters) - A key attorney executing BlackBerry Ltd’s patent licensing strategy has left the company, the second recent departure from the team tasked with making money from the Canadian company’s intellectual property.

Victor Schubert, who was a licensing director for BlackBerry, told Reuters in a brief LinkedIn message that he was no longer with the company. He did not say when he left or why.

Monetizing the company’s intellectual property is a key part of Chief Executive John Chen’s plan for turning around the company whose revenues have declined for six straight years as sales of its once ubiquitous smartphones have tumbled.

Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment on Schubert. Two switchboard operators at the Canadian company said his name was not in a global employee directory.

News of his exit follows the recent departure of Mark Kokes, who lead BlackBerry’s overall patent strategy. Kokes last month joined a health technology company.

Schubert joined BlackBerry in March 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile, as the company was embarking on a major push to boost licensing revenue.

BlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of some 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications.

Schubert has created and executed patent-licensing programs for at least four companies, including BlackBerry, dating back to 1992, according to his LinkedIn profile. It lists portfolio mining, patent valuation and negotiating patent sales as areas of expertise.

He was due to represent BlackBerry at a Seattle-area patent conference next month to discuss how operating companies can make money off their intellectual property, according to an agenda posted on the conference website in August. He is no longer listed as a panelist.

BlackBerry disclosed it had secured royalty-bearing deals with Cisco Systems Inc and another company that it did not name soon after Schubert joined. It also filed patent infringement lawsuits during his tenure against Nokia and Avaya Inc [AVXX.UL] that are ongoing.

BlackBerry on Thursday disclosed that it had settled another lawsuit, filed against low-end Android phone manufacturer BLU Products Inc.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The speech was long, the refreshments austere, but Zhang Weiguo, a Communist Party official from Hubei province in central China, was thrilled.

“It was strongly persuasive, infectious, cohesive, and had rally-appeal,” Zhang said after Chinese President and party boss Xi Jinping gave a nearly three-and-a-half hour speech in Beijing’s cavernous Great Hall of the People to kick off the 19th Communist Party Congress.

“I came out of the auditorium feeling infected, my motivation infinitely enhanced.”

The scene is a far cry from a convention of the Democratic or Republican Party in the United States, with their rock concert-like atmosphere, balloons falling from the rafters and raucous cheering crowds.

Instead, most delegates wore conservative business suits, turned pages of the speech in unison, and clapped politely on cue, giving the start of China’s most important political event in five years the vibe of an academic conference.

This is party politics with Chinese characteristics. Delegates from China’s dozens of ethnic minority groups were required, as always, to wear traditional costumes, often with elaborate headgear - and news photographers swarmed.

An Olympian wore the national team’s jacket. Military men and women, as well as police, donned crisp uniforms. All, including Xi, wore red identifications badges.

Entering the Great Hall for the event required airport-level security checks, with x-ray machines and metal detectors. Outside food and drink were not allowed. Journalists, many of whom had queued in the rain since before dawn, were permitted one mobile phone each.

Inside, Xi laid out a vision for a strong and confident China stretching decades into the future. The speech will be the subject of intensive study by party members across the country in coming months and serve as a model for its content and language.

Still, it was a marathon even by Chinese politicians’ standards, and some in the audience dozed off.

For those needing a refreshment, uniformed servers standing in order by height poured tea and hot water into Great Hall of the People paper cups outside the main auditorium.

One server who had been present for the 18th Party Congress five years ago said nothing had changed.

“Everything’s the same. Our service is getting better, though,” he said.

On stage, where the party’s powerful Central Committee and former leaders sat, hosts and hostesses periodically marched from the wings in unison to pour fresh steaming water into porcelain mugs. At the two-hour mark, some started taking toilet breaks.

Luo Jialin, a member of the Sichuan province delegation, rushed to the post office at the Great Hall of People and bought five books of congress-themed stamps with the Great Hall postmark for 450 yuan ($68).

“They are very commemorative, so I want to bring some back home,” said Luo.

The speech was broadcast live and images of groups of people watching it quickly circulated on social media - doctors at a hospital, Tibetan monks, prisoners in a detention centre, and even children in kindergarten. One posting showed a cat sitting in front of a TV broadcasting the speech.

Printed copies of Xi’s speech for foreign reporters were produced in 12 languages, including Lao and Portuguese, up from eight five years ago. The Chinese version ran to 68 pages.

Pictures of the seldom-seen 91-year-old former President Jiang Zemin peering at his copy through a chunky magnifying glass flew across the internet.

Later, someone identified Jiang’s magnifying glass as German-made and posted a picture of an ad for it on Taobao. Price tag: 1,598 yuan, or about $240.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs and an unexpected increase in inventories of gasoline and diesel.

Prices had been higher due to ongoing tensions around oil-rich Iraq and Iran, which raised risk premiums.

International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell two cents to $57.86 a barrel as of 11:18 a.m. EDT (1518 GMT). They reached their highest in three weeks earlier in the session at $58.54 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 11 cents to $51.77 a barrel.

Weekly U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding expectations. [EIA/S]

Refiners throttled down activity as the fall maintenance season got underway, and overall refining runs fell off. In addition, inventories of gasoline and diesel rose, the latter unexpectedly, reviving some concerns about elevated inventories during a time when demand for petroleum products declines.

The dropoff of 4.7 percentage points took refining output to 84.5 percent of capacity, representing the seasonally slowest rate of output since 2011.

“A setback in refinery utilization rates occurred as refiners undergo seasonal maintenance,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “Builds in refined products and a setback in refined product demand provides weight to the energy complex.”

The market has been buoyant of late due to developments in the Middle East, where tensions in northern Iraq threatened to disrupt oil flows through a key pipeline from Iraq to Turkey.

Crude flows through the 600,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Kurdish pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have dropped off sharply to around 225,000 bpd, a shipping source told Reuters.

“It remains to be seen whether the Kurds, after withdrawing from the region they claim to be entitled to, will allow crude oil to be transported by pipeline across their territory to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan,” said analysts at Commerzbank.

The Iraq crisis represents one of two notable Middle Eastern threats to oil supply, along with the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran’s compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide on further action against Tehran.

During the previous round of sanctions against Iran, some 1 million barrels per day of oil was cut from global markets.

More than one month ahead of OPEC’s next official meeting, sources told Reuters its members were leaning toward extending an oil supply cut deal struck with Russia and other producers for a further nine months.

Three OPEC sources said keeping the curbs in place until the end of 2018 was a likely outcome, while a fourth said an extension of six to nine months would be needed to remove all excess oil in storage.

A technical pattern known as a “Golden Cross” was approaching in WTI crude oil contracts on Wednesday, in which the 50-day moving average climbs higher than the 200-day. This is widely seen as a bullish price indicator, and already occurred with Brent futures on Sept. 25.","Oil slips from earlier gains as U.S. gasoline, diesel stocks rise",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-slips-from-earlier-gains-as-u-s-gasoline-diesel-stocks-rise-idUSKBN1CN05M

(Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd’s (BB.N) (BB.TO) U.S.-listed shares fell more than 1 percent on Monday, their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after a second senior executive at its patent licensing unit quit this month.

Victor Schubert, who was a licensing director for BlackBerry, said on Friday he was no longer with the company, following on the heels of the departure of Mark Kokes, who led BlackBerry’s overall patent strategy.

“Investors are left asking, if corporate insiders are leaving, why should we stick around?”, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York.

“With BlackBerry there’s also a larger macro question and its investors are asking ‘what’s their professional edge?'”, said Sarhan, who does not own shares in the company.

Monetizing the company’s intellectual property is a key part of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s plan for turning around the company, which took a back seat to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other firms in the smartphone industry.

BlackBerry is trying to get companies to pay licensing fees for the use of its 40,000 global patents on technology - spanning operating systems, networking infrastructure, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications.

The company is hoping the move will curb a six-year revenue decline as customers ditched its once-popular smartphones for Android and Apple devices.

Despite eight easing moves, however, growth is stuck at 5 percent, lagging China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam. Consumer spending was down an average 1.1 percent in July and August year-on-year.

Foreign investors are heading for the door, dumping more than $2 billion of shares in the third quarter – the biggest ejection of foreign funds from Indonesian stocks since the 2013 Federal Reserve “taper tantrum.”

The problem is President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, hasn’t fulfilled bold pledges to accelerate structural upgrades, implement projects to improve roads, bridges, ports and power grids, and create well paid jobs. Nor has he eliminated a current-account deficit that stood at $4.9 billion in the second quarter - another sore point. The World Bank now lists the rupiah among Asia’s most vulnerable currencies.

To be sure, Indonesia is not on the verge of crisis. Jokowi deserves credit for increasing accountability and transparency since taking office, and he has pushed a successful amnesty tax plan to spark investment at home. He also has kept up predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s anti-corruption campaign. In the last year alone, Jakarta moved up to 36th place from 41st in the World Economic Forum’s latest global competitiveness index.

But if Jokowi wants Indonesia to join the Group of Seven by 2030, as consultancy McKinsey predicts, he must get much more out of the two years he has left in office. That means implementing an ambitious $350 billion infrastructure programme, upping investments in education and training, and attracting more multinationals. The latter requires he curb the forces of economic nationalism at home.

The recent tussle between the government and Freeport-McMoRan sheds light on why resource-rich Indonesia isn’t pulling in more foreign direct investment. In August, the U.S. company tentatively agreed to transfer a 51 percent stake in Grasberg mine to Jakarta amid a months-long worker strike. Unsurprisingly, in the second quarter mining FDI fell by the most since 2012.

Monetary easing isn’t enough. Two-hundred basis points of rate cuts since January 2016 haven’t ignited household or business spending or quickened top-line growth. Jokowi needs to simplify investment rules, police a graft-prone bureaucracy and streamline state enterprises. Reducing bottlenecks would cheer boardrooms from Samsung to Toyota to Unilever. So would tackling land, labor and tax laws. There’s no time to waste as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens trade wars and favours a weaker dollar.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co say they are working together to make it easier to write software that can track power plants and jet engines on Apple’s iPhones and iPads.

The companies have come up with a tool for app developers to connect Apple’s iOS operating system more easily to Predix, the cloud-based software at the heart of GE’s effort to turn itself into a “digital industrial” company.

The Predix software connects sensor-laden industrial machines like wind turbines, jet engines and elevators to data centers, so that streams of information from the machines can be analyzed to help predict failures and make the machines run more cost effectively.

GE expects the software to help generate $12 billion in digital revenue by 2020, though it took a two-month “time-out” earlier this year to iron out technical problems.

Now with the help of the new software built with Apple, which GE plans to release on Oct. 26, more information from Predix will be available to the on-the-ground managers of factories and power plants who work most closely with GE’s equipment, said Kevin Ichhpurani, executive vice president of global ecosystem and channels at GE Digital.

For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance. With the Predix software, the manager can see data on the machine and could share notes and photographs from an iPad at the site of the generator and even start a video call.

“These decisions can be made at the power plant or on the factory floor, as opposed to being made at corporate,” Ichhpurani told Reuters in an interview.

As part of arrangements between the two companies, GE plans to make iPhones and iPads the standard mobile devices for its 330,000 employees and will also offer Mac desktop computers as a choice for them.

In return, Apple will help promote GE’s Predix software to Apple’s enterprise customers. Apple’s salespeople will be trained on Predix’s capabilities and will promote the software in sales situations alongside iOS devices, Susan Prescott, vice president of product market at Apple, told Reuters.

Over the past several years, Apple has courted business software firms such as Accenture PLC, International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, Deloitte and SAP SE in an effort to move business applications over to iOS devices and make them easier to use in corporate settings.","Apple and GE team up on software to track power plants, machinery",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CN1QO-OCATC

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.

“I don’t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.”

Trump’s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.

Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran’s state matters, welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.

“European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.”

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran’s compliance with the terms.

Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.

In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

“DO NOT INTERFERE”

In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran’s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons.

Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.

EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran’s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.

“They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America’s bullying and its unreasonable demands,” Khamenei said.

“They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?”

The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran’s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans.

Among many of us in the generations that have done well out of the post-World War Two period, there’s now a feeling of guilt - as there should be.

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

Post-war generations, especially the “boomers” (my own) have let the good times roll for too long. If that sounds unduly pessimistic in the face of continuing advances in many fields, neglectful of the fact that bad stuff always happens but the world continues, then reflect on the triggers – the list could be expanded - whose pulling could precipitate disaster.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s internet restrictions have struck a “new blow” against foreign companies working there, Germany’s ambassador said on Monday, warning that such moves could undermine Beijing’s political and commercial ties with the world.

China’s ongoing clampdown on cyberspace has seen WhatsApp, the messaging service run by Facebook, periodically unavailable in the past few weeks ahead of twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress that opens on Wednesday.

The government also has been tightening control over virtual private networks (VPNs) that allow users to tunnel through China’s “Great Firewall” system, which blocks outlawed online content.

And its controversial Cybersecurity Law adopted late last year has been criticized by foreign business and governments for unclear provisions mandating security reviews and for data to be stored on servers in China.

“Unrestricted internet access via VPN is vital if China wants to take maximum advantage of international cooperation in research and development as well as academic and cultural exchange,” German Ambassador Michael Clauss said in a statement.

The higher the digital wall grows, the less attractive living and working in China will be for professionals, researchers or artists, Clauss said, adding that repeated requests to discuss the issue with Chinese authorities “have not led to meaningful dialogue so far”.

“In the ‘offline’ world, our overlapping economic and political interests bring us closer together, but this trend may not be sustainable if excessive cyber controls drive us apart,” Clauss said.

The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Chinese officials say the country has a sovereign right to govern the internet as it sees fit, and that its expansive national security and cybersecurity regulations are needed to address threats such as hacking and terrorism.

China’s cyber law also mandates companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews. Critics say such measures could unfairly target foreign firms or put business secrets at risk.

After pushback from overseas business groups, China agreed to an 18-month phase-in period from June, but fundamental concerns about the law remain.

Clauss’s comments come at a sensitive time for China, as President Xi Jinping looks to consolidate his power for a second five-year term as the nation’s leader during the upcoming congress.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who reached the agreement with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, said Trump had “completely engineered” the proposal.

The agreement would provide billions of dollars of subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Trump last week announced he would end the subsidies, potentially creating chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.

“I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O‘Care,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

In another setback, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan indicated no interest in the Alexander-Murray agreement.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

While the proposal drew broad Democratic support, it remained unclear whether the agreement will even come to a vote in the Senate and House, both controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority but other than Alexander, Susan Collins and John McCain are the only Republican senators who have publicly embraced the plan.

On Tuesday, Trump had indicated support of the agreement during a news conference, saying the White House had been involved in the negotiations and that the agreement would be a “short-term solution” that would “get us over this intermediate hump.”

During Tuesday’s news conference, he also made clear that he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and that he still considered the subsidies a government handout that had enriched insurance companies.

He also told a conservative think thank, “While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray ... I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

The Trump administration followed through on the president’s plan to end the subsidies and did not make a payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to insurers that had been scheduled for Wednesday.

MORE FLEXIBILITY

The Alexander-Murray proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The subsidies compensate private insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses for low-income customers. They are known as cost-sharing reduction payments.

At an event sponsored by the news website Axios shortly before Trump posted his tweet on Wednesday, Alexander said, “Trump completely engineered the plan that we announced yesterday.”

“He wanted a bipartisan bill for the short term,” Alexander added.

Collins, a moderate who helped kill earlier Senate efforts to repeal and replace the healthcare law, said she did not know if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would schedule a vote but told CNN, “If it comes to the floor, I think the votes are there.”

The president’s move last week to discontinue subsidies was part of his effort to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through executive actions because his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Trump said on Tuesday he wanted lawmakers, once they have completed work on his tax-cut proposal, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Republicans, describing Obamacare as ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy, have sought for seven years to repeal and replace it. Scrapping the law was also a top Trump campaign pledge.

Democrats have fought to defend Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A division of Chinese commodity trader COFCO has delayed completion of a $20 million port hub in southern Brazil, three sources told Reuters, as it struggles to reorganize operations after merging its Nidera BV and Noble Agri businesses.

The transshipment hub on the bank of the Sinos river, which is still under construction, is expected to move 850,000 tonnes of grains per year - from trucks to barges bound for Rio Grande for export, and receive imported wheat shipped through that port.

Two suppliers said equipment and machines acquired by Nidera Sementes Ltda, the division responsible for the project, had been manufactured but not delivered at the buyer’s request.

“Shipment did not occur at the expected date,” one supplier said, referring to machines bought for the port. Another said the parties were discussing whether to send the equipment originally destined for that project to another COFCO unit.

COFCO, which did not reply to requests for comment, completed its takeover of Nidera this year.

The delay underscores COFCO’s battle to create a cohesive structure after first investing in Dutch-based trader Nidera in 2014 and merging it with Noble Agri, a former unit of Singapore’s Noble Group, to create COFCO Intl last April.

Since first investing in Nidera, COFCO has had several setbacks including a $150 million financial hole in its Latin American operations and $200 million in unauthorized trading losses on its biofuels desk.

One person familiar with COFCO’s strategy said the company was looking at divesting assets as it integrated Nidera and Noble into the company and fine-tuned operations.

The port hub project’s main suppliers include silo maker Kepler Weber SA and TMSA Tecnologia em Movimentação SA, a maker of belt conveyors and grain loading machines. TMSA declined to comment. Kepler Weber did not reply to a request for comment.

Budgeted at 62 million reais ($20 million), the project was intended to create 50 direct and 200 indirect jobs, according to a description Nidera sent to regulator Antaq in 2013.

Antaq filings show the regulator granted formal approval for the project on a 140,837 square-meter area in the town of Canoas in Rio Grande do Sul state in May 2016.

Reuters reported in August that COFCO was considering selling Nidera’s Latin American seeds business.

One communist politician branded it “abominable filth.”

“The Death of Stalin,” which stars Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Isaacs, held its U.K. premiere on Tuesday night. As the title suggests, it features a scene depicting the Soviet dictator’s demise in 1953.

“The comedy is about what’s going on inside the Kremlin, the power struggle, you know, the frantic kind of fight for survival really,” Iannucci told Reuters.

“That’s where the comedy comes and the paranoia that’s going on as well. But the consequences of these people’s actions is what ripples out across the Soviet Union - we show that for real.”

There has been no comment from the Kremlin about the film.

But communist members of the Russian parliament are calling for a ban on its release in Russia.

Russian Communist party spokesman Alexander Yushchenko, himself a parliamentarian, described the film as “abominable filth,” in an interview cited by the party’s website.

“Today’s support – including for Stalin and (state founder Vladimir) Lenin – is on the rise, first and foremost among young people,” he said.

Sergei Obukhov, another senior member of the Russian communist party, drew a similar conclusion saying the film was “a new form of psychological warfare against our country.”

Stalin ruled Russia for three decades during which he is widely held responsible for the deaths of millions of people, many in the Gulag network of labour camps.

The image of the dictator appears to be going through something of a rehabilitation in Russia though.

A poll by the Russia’s Levada Centre in June found that respondents considered Stalin the “most outstanding person” in history, followed by present-day president, Vladimir Putin.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

(Reuters) - Amazon Studios (AMZN.O) chief Roy Price has resigned, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday, following allegations that he harassed a producer and took no action when an actress told him she was sexually assaulted by producer Harvey Weinstein.

Price went on a leave of absence last week and Albert Cheng, the studio’s chief operating officer, remains interim head of the division, the spokeswoman said.

Price did not return requests for comment.

Many women have shared their experiences of mistreatment on social media using the hashtag #MeToo, in the wake of allegations of harassment against Weinstein in reports this month by The New York Times and The New Yorker.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

The Hollywood Reporter last week reported an allegation by Isa Hackett, a producer on one of Amazon.com Inc’s shows, that Price had lewdly propositioned her in 2015.

On Tuesday, a lawyer for Hackett confirmed the allegations.

“I‘m pleased Amazon is taking steps to address the issues,” Hackett said in a statement on Tuesday. “An important conversation has begun about the need to create a culture in our industry which values respect and decency and rejects the abuse of power and dehumanizing treatment of others.”

The accusations against Price represented a rare scandal for the online retailer.

“This is a necessary move because of the sexual harassment allegation, but I think it’s a convenient excuse to replace him,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.

Amazon fared poorly for its original TV shows at last month’s Primetime Emmy Awards. Pachter said the company has appealed to elite, liberal tastes with its original TV lineup but has lacked “content that has mass appeal.”

Amazon did not reply to requests for comment.

Nine months into his presidency, Trump has not named a chief for the Drug Enforcement Administration, currently headed by an acting administrator.
And if we conclude they don’t have the appropriate tools, then we will seek more tools,” Rosenstein said.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. lawmaker who was President Donald Trump’s pick for drug czar withdrew on Tuesday after a report he spearheaded a bill that hurt the government’s ability to crack down on opioid makers flooding the market with the addictive painkillers.

Trump had pegged Representative Tom Marino, a Republican from Pennsylvania, to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as the administration faces an epidemic of opioid overdoses that is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. The position required Senate confirmation.

Trump wrote on Twitter: “Rep. Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar. Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!”

Marino worked as a federal prosecutor under Republican former President George W. Bush, was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 and served on Trump’s transition team after the Republican president was elected last November.

Marino said in a statement he had decided to “remove the distraction my nomination has created to the utterly vital mission of this premier agency.”

He defended his role in helping pass the bill that was criticized for weakening attempts to rein in opioid use. He said the legislation would help create “a balanced solution for ensuring those who genuinely needed access to certain medications were able to do so, while also empowering the Drug Enforcement Agency to enforce the law and prevent the sale and abuse of prescription drugs.”

Marino said he had been the target of “unfair reporting” and false allegations by a former DEA employee, who he did not name.

The Washington Post and the CBS program “60 Minutes” published an investigation on Sunday that showed Marino had worked to weaken federal efforts to slow the flow of opioid drugs.

The legislation championed by Marino, which was passed by Congress and signed into law last year by Democratic President Barack Obama, was the product of a drug industry quest to weaken the DEA’s authority to stem the flow of painkillers to the black market, according to the report.

The law made it almost impossible for the DEA to freeze suspicious narcotics shipments, according to government documents cited by the Post.

Trump has been criticized for his response to the opioid epidemic. He has yet to declare it a national emergency as he pledged to do on Aug. 10 following a recommendation by a presidential commission.

Asked about that at a news conference on Monday, Trump said he would make the declaration next week. Such a move would boost funding for various forms of treatment and give the government more flexibility in taking steps to expedite action.

Nine months into his presidency, Trump has not named a chief for the Drug Enforcement Administration, currently headed by an acting administrator.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available. Estimates show the death rate has continued rising.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Marino’s withdrawal “the right decision,” but added that “the fact that he was nominated in the first place is further evidence that when it comes to the opioid crisis, the Trump administration talks the talk, but refuses to walk the walk.”

NEW INDICTMENTS

No. 2 U.S. Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein, asked about the Marino-backed law during a news conference announcing indictments against accused Chinese fentanyl traffickers, said the Trump administration would review the law.

Rosenstein said he was “not prepared to answer” whether the administration would ask Congress to repeal it.

“We are going to look into these issues ... about what tools DEA has available to it. And if we conclude they don’t have the appropriate tools, then we will seek more tools,” Rosenstein said.

The Justice Department announced the indictments of two major Chinese drug traffickers on charges of illegally making and selling fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid painkiller, over the internet to Americans.

The department said it charged Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, with conspiring to distribute large quantities of fentanyl and chemically similar drugs. It said Zhang’s actions led to four deaths.

Trump’s opioid commission, headed by Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, cited government data showing that since 1999 U.S. opioid overdoses have quadrupled, adding that nearly two-thirds of U.S. drug overdoses were linked to opioids such as heroin and the powerful painkillers Percocet, OxyContin and fentanyl.",Trump's drug czar nominee withdraws from consideration,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-opioid/trumps-drug-czar-nominee-withdraws-from-consideration-idUSKBN1CM1UC

John Madden, whose credits include the Oscar-winning ""Shakespeare in Love"" (1998), spoke to Reuters about film festival juries and whether getting along with other jurors is essential.

Q: Have you been on many festival juries before?

A: Yes, I have. I was president of the jury at the London Film Festival a number of years ago, and before that I was on the jury of the San Sebastian film festival.

Q: What is it like being on a festival jury?

A: It is extraordinarily stimulating. In one sense, to be in a darkened room, watching three films a day can sound like an arduous task, but I find it exhilarating. In the situation I am in, in Mumbai, it is particularly interesting and exciting to see 12 debut films I think have already garnered a reputation. It is so fascinating to watch those films with peers and to get to talk about them and deconstruct them. The only part which is difficult is to select a winner. Because films can be so many different things and it implies by selecting one that the others are disqualified and that is a difficult process.

Q: A festival jury is also about your other jurors. Is getting along the criteria for a good jury?

A: I think you have to respect and welcome each other’s views. I have also had the experience of being a jury in the judicial sense, in the UK and that is an even more onerous task. In the case of a festival, you are dealing across cultures, which is completely fascinating. This is a very particular example of it, and a very stimulating one.

Q: What happens when you are on the other side, as in when your film is competing at a festival?

A: Well, there is BAFTA. Even now, the majority of awards given out there, other than the two acting awards and the Best Film award, are decided by jury and large juries of peers. I am very used to that part of the process. I was in competition with ""Mrs Brown"" at Un Certain Regard in Cannes and with ""Shakespeare in Love"" at Berlin … the answer is that it's exciting if you win, and it is still an honour if you don't. You don't feel resentful. The most extreme example is that of ""Shakespeare in Love"". None of us had any expectation that it would win the kind of nominations that it did or that it would win what it did.

Q: Would the criteria for a film at festivals be different from one competing at an award ceremony? Would you judge a film differently depending on where you were judging it?

A: Not from where I was judging it, definitely. At the Mumbai Film Festival, I am in the jury [for] the international competition. So by definition, they come from all over the world. Also, they are debut films. So when one assesses those films, you are looking for the distinctiveness of a voice. You don't come with any preconceptions about what the film or what the filmmakers' reputations might be, which is the purest and cleanest way you can approach a film. Basically, just try and keep aside any preconceptions you might have and see the film for what it is.

Q: What do you make of the rule that the international competition this year has only films from debut filmmakers?

A: I think what you are asking is: should there be a competition which has a wider remit, considering all the films that would be considered elsewhere? I think it is totally welcome that the international competition focuses on debut films. It's more exciting to identify distinctive voices at the beginning of someone's career. I can see that from the point of view that Mumbai's presence on the festival map might be heightened by a competition that is considering the same films as other major festivals all over the world. But the London Film Festival, for example, doesn't see itself that way. The competition in London is not the most significant thing about the festival. In some ways, it is more like Toronto. It has some awards, but they are not what capture the imagination of the public.",Q&A: John Madden on heading the Mumbai Film Festival jury,https://in.reuters.com/article/john-madden-interview/qa-john-madden-on-heading-the-mumbai-film-festival-jury-idINKBN1CM0T8

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who reached the agreement with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, said Trump had “completely engineered” the proposal.
Trump last week announced he would end the subsidies, potentially creating chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.
“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who reached the agreement with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, said Trump had “completely engineered” the proposal.

The agreement would provide billions of dollars of subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Trump last week announced he would end the subsidies, potentially creating chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.

“I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O‘Care,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

In another setback, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan indicated no interest in the Alexander-Murray agreement.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

While the proposal drew broad Democratic support, it remained unclear whether the agreement will even come to a vote in the Senate and House, both controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority but other than Alexander, Susan Collins and John McCain are the only Republican senators who have publicly embraced the plan.

On Tuesday, Trump had indicated support of the agreement during a news conference, saying the White House had been involved in the negotiations and that the agreement would be a “short-term solution” that would “get us over this intermediate hump.”

During Tuesday’s news conference, he also made clear that he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and that he still considered the subsidies a government handout that had enriched insurance companies.

He also told a conservative think thank, “While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray ... I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

The Trump administration followed through on the president’s plan to end the subsidies and did not make a payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to insurers that had been scheduled for Wednesday.

MORE FLEXIBILITY

The Alexander-Murray proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The subsidies compensate private insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses for low-income customers. They are known as cost-sharing reduction payments.

At an event sponsored by the news website Axios shortly before Trump posted his tweet on Wednesday, Alexander said, “Trump completely engineered the plan that we announced yesterday.”

“He wanted a bipartisan bill for the short term,” Alexander added.

Collins, a moderate who helped kill earlier Senate efforts to repeal and replace the healthcare law, said she did not know if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would schedule a vote but told CNN, “If it comes to the floor, I think the votes are there.”

The president’s move last week to discontinue subsidies was part of his effort to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through executive actions because his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Trump said on Tuesday he wanted lawmakers, once they have completed work on his tax-cut proposal, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Republicans, describing Obamacare as ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy, have sought for seven years to repeal and replace it. Scrapping the law was also a top Trump campaign pledge.

Democrats have fought to defend Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic lawmakers called on Wednesday for a congressional committee to issue subpoenas to the White House and three companies for documents about fired national security adviser Michael Flynn.

In a letter to Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, the panel’s Democratic members said the committee should demand documents the White House has refused to hand over despite a bipartisan request in March.

Some of the documents are related to work on a proposal to build nuclear reactors in the Middle East with the involvement of Russian firms.

Three companies - Flynn’s consultancy and two companies he advised on the nuclear project -- have not produced documents and communications the committee’s minority members requested on September 15, and should be compelled to cooperate, the Democratic members said.

Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined to comment.

The committee has been probing whether Flynn fully disclosed payments from foreign sources and overseas trips when he renewed his Top Secret security clearance last year.

One focus of the probe is a June 2015 trip Flynn, a former general, took to Israel and Egypt to gauge interest in a plan floated by a group of scientists, consultants, and former military officers to build and provide security for dozens of nuclear power plants in the Middle East.

A promotional slide indicates that Rosoboron, a Russian state-owned arms exporter that is under U.S. sanctions, was to be part of the multi-billion dollar project.

In the letter, Democratic lawmakers argued that subpoenas were needed to determine whether Flynn was promoting the project while he was in the White House.

“We believe the paper trail must be pursued to answer the gravest question of all - did General Flynn seek to change the course of our country’s national security to benefit the same private interests he previously promoted,” the letter said.

Flynn is a central figure in a federal probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Donald Trump aides colluded with Russia to boost the Republican’s presidential campaign. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion.

Trump fired Flynn in February after a top Justice Department official warned that the former Defense Intelligence Agency director could be blackmailed because Moscow knew he made misleading statements about his contacts with Russian officials.

The Democrats also pointed to a discrepancy between Flynn’s financial disclosures and statements to the committee by the counsel for IronBridge Group, Inc. and IP3 Corp., two companies set up by former Navy Rear Admiral Michael Hewitt.

In an amended disclosure in August, Flynn said he served as an advisor to IronBridge from June 2016 to December 2016, a period that overlapped with his work on Trump’s presidential campaign and the post-election transition.

In contrast, the counsel for IP3 and IronBridge told the committee that the company tried to hire Flynn, but he never accepted the offer.",House Democrats seek documents on former Trump aide Michael Flynn,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-flynn/house-democrats-seek-documents-on-former-trump-aide-michael-flynn-idUSKBN1CN27B

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing sales unexpectedly increased in August, rising the most in eight months, on higher sales of vehicles and parts, as well as petroleum and coal products, data from Statistics Canada showed on Wednesday.

The 1.6 percent growth was well above forecasts for a 0.1 percent decline and the largest gain since December 2016. Stripping out the effects of price changes, volumes were also solid, rising 1.2 percent.

Manufacturing sales rose in eight out of 21 sectors, accounting for 66 percent of the manufacturing sector and led by a 8.2 percent increase in the transportation equipment sector.

That was driven by higher sales volumes of motor vehicles and parts following increased production after assembly plants were shut for longer than usual in July, the statistics agency said. Vehicle sales in Canada are on track to hit a record in 2017.

Sales in the petroleum and coal sector rose 3.2 percent, largely because of higher prices. Elsewhere, manufacturing sales rose in the primary metal and machinery sectors.

Forward-looking new orders climbed 4.4 percent, the most since April 2016 and potentially boding well for future sales.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe plans to cut its budget deficit by half next year to 4 percent of GDP, the national Treasury said, an ambitious goal at a time when the country is expected to hold a presidential vote that veteran President Robert Mugabe is set to contest.

The southern African country has over the last four years failed to cut its deficit despite promises to do so, mainly due to high government spending on public sector salaries, which accounted for more than 90 percent of the 2016 budget.

In an election year Mugabe’s government is unlikely to reduce spending, economic analysts said, making it difficult to cut the deficit to 4 percent of gross domestic product. This year the government targets a deficit of 8.4 percent fo GDP.

Zimbabwe, which dumped its hyperinflation-hit currency for the U.S. dollar in 2009, is now running short of dollars as well as quasi-currency “bond note” introduced last year to ease cash shortages.

A Treasury document seen by Reuters on Tuesday said the Treasury “will focus on containment of the budget deficit as one of the key fiscal anchors”.

“In the absence of strong measures targeted at containing expenditures and enhancing revenues, further deterioration of the budget deficit is likely to be sustained beyond 2018,” it said.

The government expects improved tax collection next year to increase revenue while reducing the share of public sector salaries to 80 percent of the budget, from 85 percent this year.

SCEPTICISM

But analysts were sceptical, saying the government would likely buckle to pressure to spend in order to gain votes during next year’s presidential and parliamentary elections.

“This government has a track record of spending beyond its means and in an election year we will see a much, much bigger deficit,” said Harare-based economist John Robertson.

Zimbabwe does not receive funding from foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank because it is in arrears, and so relies on domestic taxes and borrowing from local banks to fund the national budget.

The country’s foreign and domestic debt will increase to $14 billion in 2018 from $13 billion this year, the Treasury said.

Analysts said government borrowing was pushing up money supply and ultimately inflation, which rose to 0.78 percent year-on-year in September, its fastest rise since 2009.

Most independent economic analysts, however, say annual inflation has already hit double digit figures following an increase in prices, especially of imported goods.

“It’s the truth. It wasn’t our best game on Saturday. It’s a good call from him to motivate us and to make us work to change things from the last performance.”

“Football is a sport that changes very quickly... the only solution is to work hard and win the next one.”

Chelsea will be without long-term injury absentees N‘Golo Kante and Danny Drinkwater while fellow midfielder Victor Moses limped off midway through the first half at Palace.

“It’s normal when you play in four competitions there are so many games, and because of this there is more risk of injury or tiredness. We train very well to stay away from injuries and it is something weird that is happening now with the injuries.”

However, President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman struck a more positive tone, saying he expected the crisis to be resolved soon following the arrival in Turkey of a U.S. delegation for talks on repairing bilateral ties.

Earlier this month Washington suspended visa services after Turkey detained two Turkish nationals employed as U.S. consular staff. They are being held on suspicion of links to last year’s failed coup in Turkey, allegations rejected by Washington.

Ankara swiftly retaliated by suspending its own visa services in the United States, a move that hit the Turkish lira and stocks and unnerved investors.

The U.S. delegation has laid out four conditions to solve the crisis, private broadcaster Haberturk reported, including a request that Ankara provide evidence related to the detentions.

“We will cooperate if their demands meet the rules of our constitution but we will not succumb to impositions and we will reject any conditions that we cannot meet,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference on Wednesday.

The two people arrested by Turkey are a translator at the consulate in the southern province of Adana and a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker in Istanbul.

Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the talks with the United States were now moving in a “good direction”.

“I believe this crisis will be resolved soon,” he told state-owned TRT Haber.

“The U.S. delegation does not have the authority to lift the visa suspension but they will communicate our views to Washington and, hopefully, the White House will take positive steps soon”.

Relations between Turkey and its Western allies have soured significantly since the July 2016 coup and the large-scale purges of the Turkish armed forces, state institutions, media and academia that followed.

Ankara blames the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the coup and has repeatedly asked Washington to extradite him. Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.

Turkey has sacked or suspended more than 150,000 people from their jobs on suspicion of links to the Gulen network, prompting crticism from rights groups, the United States and the European Union that Ankara is undermining free speech and democracy.",Turkey says will not submit to 'impositions' from United States in visa crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-turkey-security/turkey-says-will-not-submit-to-impositions-from-united-states-in-visa-crisis-idUSKBN1CN0WM

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it would push the United Nations Security Council to renew within days an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, setting the stage for a likely showdown with Russia.

Russia has questioned the work and future of the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and said it would decide whether to support extending the mandate after investigators submit their next report.

The inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an April 4 attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people.

“We would like to see it renewed prior to the report coming out,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley told reporters.

“The Russians have made it very clear that should the report blame the Syrians suddenly they won’t have faith in the JIM. If the report doesn’t blame the Syrians then they say that they will. We can’t work like that,” Haley said.

A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.

Haley said she would circulate a draft resolution to the 15-member Security Council later on Wednesday to renew the mandate for the JIM, which is due to expire in mid-November. It was unanimously created by the council in 2015 and renewed in 2016.

A resolution must get nine votes in favor and not be vetoed by any of the council’s five permanent members - Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France - in order to pass.

The JIM has found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during a civil war that has lasted more than six years.

Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s non-proliferation and arms control department, said on Friday there were “serious problems” with the work of the inquiry.

“In order to judge if it deserves an extension of the mandate, we need to see the report ... and assess it,” Ulyanov told a briefing at the United Nations to present Moscow’s view on the “Syrian chemical dossier.”","U.S., Russia set for likely U.N. row over Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CN29T-OCATP

SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - A economia do Brasil contraiu mais do que o esperado em agosto, resultado mais fraco em cinco meses e interrompendo dois meses de alta, mas ainda insuficiente para frear o processo de recuperação gradual da atividade.

O Índice de Atividade Econômica do BC (IBC-Br), espécie de sinalizador do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), caiu 0,38 por cento em agosto sobre julho, em dado dessazonalizado. Pesquisa da Reuters com analistas mostrou que a expectativa era de contração de 0,15 por cento.

“Esse resultado não altera nossa expectativa de retomada gradual da atividade econômica. Esperamos ainda uma aceleração da atividade econômica no quarto trimestre, consistente com nossa projeção de uma expansão de 0,9 por cento do PIB neste ano”, informou o banco Bradesco em nota.

O resultado negativo foi o maior desde março, quando o IBC-Br teve contração de 0,40 por cento, e veio após o país ter iniciado o terceiro trimestre com crescimento mensal de 0,36 por cento em julho, em dado revisado pelo BC de alta de 0,41 por cento divulgada inicialmente.

“Tomara, eu tenho essa esperança, mas não acho fácil”, disse o ministro a jornalistas após participar do lançamento de consulta pública sobre a nova política de telecomunicações do governo federal.

O ministério de Kassab integra um grupo de trabalho liderado pela Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU) que está discutindo saídas para a dívida da Oi, principalmente os mais de 10 bilhões de reais em multas devidos à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel).

A Agência confirmou nesta quarta-feira que escolheu seu superintendente-executivo, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, para representar o órgão regulador na assembleia de credores da operadora. Na terça, uma fonte de governo havia antecipado à Reuters que a Anatel já havia escolhido quem a representaria na reunião da próxima segunda-feira.

PLANO DE TELECOMUNICAÇÕES

O governo lançou nesta quarta-feira a consulta pública de seu novo decreto para a política de telecomunicações, com foco na expansão da banda larga.

Segundo o secretário de Telecomunicações do ministério de Kassab, André Borges, o plano prevê, por exemplo, apoiar projetos já existentes no Congresso que viabilizem a criação de um fundo, a partir de uma reformulação do Fundo de Universalização dos Servições de Telecomunicações (Fust), mas destinado à banda larga.

A ideia do ministério é que esse novo fundo não tenha seus recursos contingenciados, como ocorre com o FUST, para poder ajudar a financiar investimentos em banda larga.

“A longo prazo, nós dependemos da revisão, sim, de um fundo de universalização dos serviços, que é o serviço de banda larga em todo o país”, disse Borges.

Esse novo fundo teria a mesma base de arrecadação do atual Fust, segundo o secretário.

O plano conta também com a aprovação do projeto de lei que permita a mudança do regime de concessão para autorização para as operadoras de telefonia fixa.

Segundo Borges, o projeto prevê que as empresas que mudem de regime paguem uma espécie de bônus e esses recursos também poderiam ser usados nos projetos de banda larga.

Madrid (Reuters) - Kurz vor dem Ablauf eines Ultimatums hat die spanische Zentralregierung die katalanischen Separatisten erneut zum Einlenken aufgerufen.

Der dortige Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont müsse mit Vernunft vorgehen und den Interessen aller Bürger Priorität einräumen, sagte Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy am Mittwoch im Parlament in Madrid. Die katalanische Regierung hatte allerdings zuletzt erklärt, nicht auf die Frist reagieren zu wollen. Sie läuft am Donnerstag (10.00 Uhr) ab. Bis dahin soll Puigdemont eindeutig sagen, ob er die Unabhängigkeit der wohlhabenden Region erklärt hat oder nicht. Ohne Reaktion aus Barcelona könnte Katalonien seine Autonomie verlieren. Rajoy argumentiert, dass die spanische Verfassung keine Abspaltung eines Landesteiles zulässt.

Die Krise spitzte sich am Montag zu, als das oberste Gericht Spaniens für zwei Anführer der Separatistenbewegung Untersuchungshaft anordnete. Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft ihnen vor, bei einer Protestaktion im September eine wichtige Rolle gespielt zu haben. Damals wurden Polizisten in Barcelona eingekesselt und ihre Fahrzeuge beschädigt. Gegen die Inhaftierung protestierten am Dienstagabend in der katalanischen Hauptstadt Zehntausende Menschen friedlich. Sie riefen etwa “Freiheit” oder “Besatzungstruppen raus”.

Puigdemont sprach von “politischen Gefangenen” und spielte damit auf die jahrzehntelange Franco-Diktatur an. Damals wurde die katalanische Kultur und Sprache systematisch unterdrückt. Justizminister Rafael Catala entgegnete Kritikern, es handele sich um eine Entscheidung der Justiz und nicht der Politik.

Der Konflikt beunruhigt auch die Finanzmärkte und Manager. Seit dem umstrittenen Unabhängigkeitsreferendum am 2. Oktober haben nach offiziellen Zahlen 700 Unternehmen ihren Firmensitze aus Katalonien verlagert.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

LONDON (Reuters) - American author George Saunders has won the 2017 Man Booker Prize, a high-profile literary award, for his first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” - a fictional account of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln burying his young son.

In his acceptance speech, Saunders, 58, noted that “we live in a strange time,” adding he saw the key question of the era being whether society responded to events with “exclusion and negative projection and violence,” or “with love.”

Saunders was the second consecutive American writer to win the prize, after the rules were changed in 2014 to allow authors of any book written in English and published in the U.K. to compete.

His novel, set in 1862, a year into the American Civil war, is a blend of historical accounts and imaginative fiction, which sees Lincoln’s son Willie, who died in the White House at age 11, in “Bardo” - a Tibetan form of purgatory.

The judging panel, led by author and member of Britain’s House of Lords Lola Young, praised the “deeply moving” book, saying it was “utterly original”.

Last year, American Paul Beatty became the first American to win the award, for his novel “The Sellout,” a biting satire on race relations in the United States.

Other previous winners have included this year’s Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, Salman Rushdie, Iris Murdoch and Canadian writer Margaret Atwood.

The award was previously open only to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe or countries in the British Commonwealth. The winner receives a 50,000 pound ($65,000) cash prize.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The head of Kenya’s election commission said on Wednesday he could not guarantee next week’s presidential election will be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues.

Wafula Chebukati’s statement came hours after another commission member resigned and left the country, saying she and her staff had been repeatedly threatened.

“Ironically, the very people, political leaders, who are supposed to build the nation have become the greatest threat to the peace and stability of the nation,” Chebukati told journalists.

The Oct. 26 poll is the re-run of an election that took place in August, where incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory was nullified on procedural grounds.

But the run-up to the new poll has been fraught, particularly since Kenyatta’s main challenger, opposition leader Raila Odinga, pulled out, alleging a failure to improve the oversight of the election.

Odinga has called nearly daily protests against the poll and the election commission, pushing East Africa’s largest economy - a stable Western ally in a chaotic region - deeper into turmoil.

Kenyatta on Wednesday restated his commitment to the poll, but Odinga called for a mass protest on election day - raising the prospect of confrontations between protesters and voters.

“Demonstrations will continue. October 26 will be the biggest demonstration of them all,” Odinga told a crowd of several thousand cheering supporters in Nairobi.

Commission head Chebukati said technical preparations for the new poll were on course, but his attempts to make “critical changes”, notably to staff, had been defeated by a majority of commissioners. He said he been pressured to resign, without giving further details.

“Under such conditions, it is difficult to guarantee a free fair and credible election,” Chebukati said. “We cannot move forward with a divided commission.”

Election staff attending training sessions in some opposition strongholds were attacked this week, police said.

A senior Western diplomat in Nairobi condemned the attacks, saying of Odinga: “There is growing frustration among Western diplomats that a man who stood for democracy ... is essentially in charge of a movement trying to sabotage an election.”

“There is thuggery going on ... People who incite violence will be held accountable,” the diplomat told Reuters.

Roselyn Akombe, another of the board’s eight members, flew to New York and issued a statement dated Tuesday, saying “the commission has become a party to the current crisis” and was “under siege”.

She said commissioners were serving partisan interests, and legal advice was being skewed for political reasons. Akombe urged Kenyans to remember the violence that followed a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed. She told BBC radio she fled after receiving threats from both sides.

A week before the August poll, the election commission’s head of IT was found tortured and murdered in Nairobi, raising fears of a possible hack of the commission’s computer systems.

At least 37 people have died in violence since the August vote, including four killed in confrontations between police and protesters in the past week.

The uncertainty over the vote has affected financial markets: the central bank sold dollars in the foreign exchange market after the Kenyan shilling weakened on news of Akombe’s resignation. [nL8N1MT1F5]

Central bank governor Patrick Njoroge told Reuters on Thursday that the government was revising its 2017 economic growth forecast downwards amid high political uncertainty. [L8N1MT4FJ] Last month, Kenya cut its growth forecast to 5.5 percent from 5.9 percent.

PROTESTS AND POLITICS

Kenyan law requires that the new election be held within 60 days of the Sept. 1 decision by the Supreme Court to cancel the results of the original vote, but Odinga says his withdrawal should trigger a new, 90-day election cycle.

In withdrawing his candidacy last week, Odinga said the election board had not carried out reforms, including firing of key officials who he blames for mistakes in the Aug. 8 vote.

But Kenyatta said in a televised speech on Wednesday: “We walk towards the declared date of the 26th of October both as a God-fearing leadership and government.”

The ruling party has used its parliamentary majority to pass amendments to the electoral law curtailing the grounds on which the Supreme Court can nullify an election. Kenyatta has not yet signed the amendments after heavy international criticism.

The election board says it has conducted some reforms and the vote will go ahead with Odinga on the ballot.

This week, police raided homes belonging to wealthy opposition financier Jimi Wanjigi and said they had found a cache of weapons. Wanjigi said in an emotional interview that the firearms were licensed and that he was being persecuted.

On Tuesday, Deputy President William Ruto said Odinga had pulled out of the race to avoid a “humiliating defeat”.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Call them China’s bubble generation.

They were born after the crushing of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, raised mostly without siblings during an unprecedented economic boom, and came of age as Xi Jinping, China’s strongest leader in decades, ascended to power.

It’s a generation that grew up in an era of prosperity and peace; one that has not “eaten bitterness” - or struggled - as their parents and grandparents did.

With Xi starting another five years as China’s top leader, Reuters sought to get to know some members of this bubble generation - 10 people who graduated from university and entered the workforce when Xi’s first term started five years ago.

They are the “Class of 2012”.

The 10 men and women represent just a fraction of the 190 million people born in the 1990s, but they provided key insights into Xi’s China and the generation that will inherit his legacy.

They live in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan and Putuan, in Hubei province. Their backgrounds are diverse. They are the sons and daughters of a former factory owner, restaurateurs, a doctor, a construction worker, a local official, and a school administrator.

They attended three different universities – China’s leading trade and economics college in Beijing, a regional university in the central city of Wuhan, and a third-tier technology school in the southwestern city of Chengdu.

That makes them somewhat privileged in a country where relatively few people get to pursue higher education.

Their experiences differ, often widely. And yet, they have much in common.

They are optimistic, open-minded and tend to have a free-spirited streak, even though family roots and obligations remain important. For the unmarried among them, some feel acute pressure to find a mate. Others actively reject the traditional path.

“A good thing about our generation is that, I think, we have more direction in our lives,” said Wu Qiong, the 27-year-old daughter of an insurance saleswoman and a kindergarten headmaster in Wuhan. “Really, you know how you want to live your life, rather than everyone living the same way.”

They crave travel and experiences, and grew up in comfort for the most part. Most have had everything they’ve needed - food and clothing - and often more, things like Nintendo Gameboys or vacations.

They’ve all known extraordinary economic growth year in and year out, making a painful slowdown hard to imagine. Property prices only rise in their world – a double edged sword for young adults trying to get established.

China’s upward trajectory is a given.

“I think the world is getting better and better,” said Qin Lijuan, 28, a personal finance consultant in Chengdu. “Even if we face an economic crisis, as long as you make safe plans your life is still worry-free.”

Zhang Weixuan, an assistant secretary of the board at a software company, poses for pictures near her office in Beijing's financial district, China, September 3, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter

Members of the “Class of 2012”, like many in China, project political apathy – reflecting perhaps instinctual caution on a sensitive topic in the presence of journalists, or possibly genuine insouciance.

“I don’t care about politics because my job has nothing to do with politics,” said Zheng Yue, 27, an interior designer in Chengdu. “And also I can’t solve political problems. Even if I cared a lot about it, it’s no use. I can’t change anything.”

When political issues are injected into their daily lives, as with internet censorship, they always find a workaround so they can see their favorite television shows or news stories they’re interested in.

BUBBLY OPTIMISM

Xi faces deep socio-economic challenges, and has made it clear that he believes more government control - not less - is what the country needs.

Slideshow (4 Images)

But what if things go sideways, if the China narrative shifts, or if the economy slows significantly, as many economists think is inevitable? What if it hits a brick wall?

“Young Chinese seem to share with young Americans of the 1950s and 1960s a near-unbridgeable generation gap and a huge optimism,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.

But, he said, they are probably ill-prepared for future shocks, despite the experiences and advice of their parents.

Try telling that to Wu.

Born and raised in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province some 700 km (435 miles) inland from Shanghai, she is in many ways emblematic of the “Class of 2012”.

Articulate and cheerful, Wu decided after graduating from university that the English degree she earned was insufficient to pursue her ambitions - so she got a Master’s degree in accounting. She now works in the international settlements department of a foreign bank.

She hasn’t been able to buy property herself, but she recently persuaded her mother to invest some of her life savings in an apartment in a development called “Cambridge City”. The buildings are next to a subway line under construction. Their plan is to flip it in a couple years.

“The appreciation in house values is much bigger than the return on fixed-term deposits at banks,” Wu said. “For sure it won’t go down.”

In terms of job security, Wu also doesn’t seem to worry.

“In my life I‘m not afraid of the future at all,” she said. “I don’t fear change.”

And, she adds, “if some day there’s a big economic crisis and the financial sector falls into recession I think I could go back and be an English teacher.”",Coming of age in an era of prosperity: Meet China's 'bubble generation',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-classof2012/coming-of-age-in-an-era-of-prosperity-meet-chinas-bubble-generation-idUSKBN1CM1FX

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, were down 11.0 percent from September 2016, while home prices were up 10.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the group’s home price index.

“National sales appear to be stabilizing,” CREA President Andrew Peck said in a statement. “While encouraging, it’s too early to tell if this is the beginning of a longer-term trend.”

Canada’s once-sizzling housing market has cooled dramatically in recent months, particularly in Toronto, the largest city, after a foreign buyers tax was announced in April, and analysts are divided over whether the market is in the midst of a full-scale correction or will bounce back quickly.

In addition to the implementation of a foreign buyers tax in Vancouver in 2016 and Toronto in 2017, two recent interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada has helped rein in demand.

The report showed activity was up on the month in about half of all local markets, including Vancouver and Toronto. Cities around Toronto had mixed results, with activity remaining near record lows or falling further in some markets.

Sales were down from year-ago levels in nearly three-quarters of all local markets, led by Toronto and nearby housing markets.

The 10.7 percent year-over-year increase in CREA’s Home Price Index was a continued deceleration in annual price gains earlier in the year. The actual national average price for homes sold in September was up almost 3 percent from a year ago at C$487,000 ($390,537), CREA said.

Home resale prices dropped 0.8 percent in September from August, their biggest fall in seven years, while new home prices rose 0.1 percent in August, separate reports showed on Thursday. [L2N1MN0KT]

The report showed the number of newly listed homes rebounded almost 5 percent in September from August, breaking a string of three straight declines.

The national sales-to-new listings ratio declined to 55.7 percent from 57.2 percent in August. A ratio between 40 and 60 percent is generally consistent with a balanced market.

LONDON (Reuters) - S&P Global said on Wednesday it had no specific view on whether or not Spain reinstates direct rule over Catalonia, but is instead waiting to see whether the crisis does any sustained damage to a robust economic recovery.

S&P has a “positive outlook” on its BBB+ Spanish sovereign rating, but the strains over Catalonia’s bid for independence have cast doubt over the near-term upgrade prospects.

Catalonia’s regional leaders face a deadline on Thursday on whether or not to stick to, or abandon, an independence declaration made last week which Madrid has rejected as illegal.

Madrid in turn is threatening to invoke a never-before-used clause of the country’s 1978 constitution, known as Article 155, to reimpose direct rule over the eastern region.

“It remains to be seen what happens. There is clearly a lot of interest in de-escalating the situation so we don’t really have a specific view on whether Article 155 is triggered or not,” Frank Gill, one of S&P’s top sovereign analysts and who is also based in Madrid, told Reuters.

What the firm is looking at more, he said, was what it might do to Spain’s economic and fiscal performance. Before last week’s independence declaration, S&P said it did not expect to cut Spain’s rating unless tensions escalated.

“This is an economy that is growing at 3 percent, this expansion is funded by debt, export performance is picking up - it’s been remarkable - so the question is, what does Catalonia mean for all of that?”

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy issued an appeal for support in the country’s national parliament on Wednesday to take direct control of Catalonia unless the rebel regional government drops its plan to break away.

The move would need only a vote in Spain’s upper house, where Rajoy’s People’s Party holds an absolute majority. It would be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that direct rule has been imposed on a particular region.

The uncertainty has already prompted hundreds of Catalan firms to move their headquarters, led Madrid to trim its economic growth forecasts and buffeted the country’s financial markets.

Gill added that S&P was also keeping an eye on the potential impact on Spain’s debt-to-GDP level, which at more than 96 percent remains one of the highest in Europe.

“There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of improving the budgetary position,” he said. “It (Catalonia situation) is a very fluid matter.”",Direct Catalonia crisis key risk to Spain rating - S&P,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-s-p/direct-catalonia-crisis-key-risk-to-spain-rating-sp-idUKKBN1CN2D0?il=0

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most U.S. shoppers are fiercely loyal to local food stores, calling them better than online options, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll that raises questions about how much Amazon.com’s $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods will shake up the supermarket business.

Shares in Kroger Co, the largest U.S. supermarket operator, have tumbled 40 percent from this year’s highs on worries that the newly merged company will be quick to siphon business from traditional food sellers.

Seventy-five percent of online shoppers said they rarely or never buy groceries online, according to the survey of nearly 8,600 adults from Aug. 12 to Sept. 1. Even among frequent online shoppers who make internet purchases at least weekly, almost 60 percent said they never buy groceries online or do so just a few times a year, according to the poll.

The poll also found that around 60 percent of all adults said their local food markets win on price, selection, quality and convenience. Online sellers led in those categories with only around 3 percent of respondents.

“I like to touch everything,” said Beth Hatter, 31, who spends roughly $750 a month on groceries to feed an extended family in Newark, Delaware, and buys a lot of produce.

She shops at BJ’s Wholesale Club [BJ.UL], ShopRite and Food Lion, even though online shopping is an option.

Kristian Guy, 25, passes a Met Foodmarket and an organic grocer that stays open until midnight on the walk to his subway stop in Brooklyn.

“I don’t really need to think about buying food online,” said Guy, who does not want food deliveries spoiling on his doorstep.

Amazon has tried for years to grow its online grocery business, without making much of a dent. Its purchase of Whole Foods took its U.S. grocery marketshare from 0.19 percent to 1.4 percent, versus 14.46 percent for Walmart and 7.17 percent for Kroger, according to GlobalData Retail.

The poll shows “brick and mortar is not dead yet,” said Roger Davidson, a grocery consultant, who predicts that the future of food buying will be mix of online and offline shopping.

The Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen expect U.S. online grocery sales to grow from $20.5 billion, or 4 percent overall, in 2016 to $100 billion, or 20 percent overall, by 2025.

Still, some respondents are changing or are open to changing the way they use technology to shop.

Fort Lauderdale resident Ashley Vettese, 24, who said she was wary of online retailers’ food quality, uses grocery store apps for coupons. Kirsten Fox, 28, of Albany, Oregon, likes to pick out her own food. But she said she would consider new online ordering/curbside pickup services being rolled out by Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores Inc to avoid taking her young son into crowded stores during flu season.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The number of asylum seekers walking across the U.S. border into Canada illegally dropped by more than two-thirds in September from August, government data showed on Monday, as officials seek to dispel myths around the country’s refugee system.

The decline, to 1,881 from 5,712, brings the total number of border-crossers so far this year to 15,102 - the vast majority entering the primarily French-speaking province of Quebec. The influx prompted the creation of a temporary tent encampment in Quebec and sparked a backlash from anti-migrant groups.

September’s drop comes after a push by Canada’s federal government to correct “misinformation” in diaspora communities in the United States that Canada gives all refugee applicants permanent resident status.

Canada received almost 36,000 refugee claims in the first nine months of the year, putting the country on track to have more claims this year than any since 2001.

Preliminary numbers indicate many asylum seekers are succeeding in their refugee claims, which means they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home countries.

Lawyers who have handled dozens of cases told Reuters that decision-makers, previously skeptical of claims from people who spent time in the United States, have been sympathetic toward clients who say they left fearing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Acceptance rates in the first half of this year were in keeping with previous years’.

Of the 300 asylum seekers processed since Sept. 5 by the Immigration and Refugee Board’s dedicated team in Quebec, between 165 and 177 have been accepted, according to spokeswoman Anna Pape.

That success rate is higher than previous years’ averages for Haitians, who make up the majority of asylum seekers who crossed into Quebec illegally this summer.

”A lot of assumptions have been made about the refugee claimants arriving in recent months,“ said Canadian Council for Refugees Executive Director Janet Dench. ”We are not surprised to find that a significant proportion are found to be refugees.”

The number of refugee hearings delayed due to lack of people to hear the case or places to hold the hearing rose tenfold within a year, according to refugee board statistics.

It will take an estimated 16 months for claims now in the queue to be decided, Pape said – leaving asylum seekers in limbo as they try to establish lives in Canada.

Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said earlier this month the government has no plans to boost the refugee board’s resources.",Big drop in asylum seekers illegally crossing into Canada in September,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CL2TW-OCADN

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Worry that rising consumer prices will threaten the Indian central bank’s inflation target of 4 percent led the majority of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee to vote to keep rates steady, according to minutes issued on Wednesday.

Committee members also said at their Oct. 4 meeting they expected that a slowdown in economic growth to its lowest in more than three years in the April-June quarter could prove transitory, and it was prudent to wait for more evidence.

“It is important to recognise near- and medium-term risks to the inflation outlook,” RBI Governor Urjit Patel said, according to the minutes of the meeting.

“There is a need for more data to assess whether the recent headwinds in overall GDP growth prints are transient or sustained.”

The RBI’s six-member monetary policy committee voted 5-1 to keep the repo rate unchanged at the on Oct. 4 meeting after inflation in August surged to 3.36 percent from a year earlier - not far off the central bank’s 4 percent target.

However, data after the meeting showed inflation held steady at 3.28 percent in September, in line with a downwardly revised number for August, although analysts said they expected the repo rate to remain unchanged for now.

And if we conclude they don’t have the appropriate tools, then we will seek more tools,” Rosenstein said.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. lawmaker who was President Donald Trump’s pick for drug czar withdrew on Tuesday after a report he spearheaded a bill that hurt the government’s ability to crack down on opioid makers flooding the market with the addictive painkillers.

Trump had pegged Representative Tom Marino, a Republican from Pennsylvania, to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as the administration faces an epidemic of opioid overdoses that is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. The position required Senate confirmation.

Trump wrote on Twitter: “Rep. Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar. Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!”

Marino worked as a federal prosecutor under Republican former President George W. Bush, was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 and served on Trump’s transition team after the Republican president was elected last November.

Marino said in a statement he had decided to “remove the distraction my nomination has created to the utterly vital mission of this premier agency.”

He defended his role in helping pass the bill that was criticized for weakening attempts to rein in opioid use. He said the legislation would help create “a balanced solution for ensuring those who genuinely needed access to certain medications were able to do so, while also empowering the Drug Enforcement Agency to enforce the law and prevent the sale and abuse of prescription drugs.”

Marino said he had been the target of “unfair reporting” and false allegations by a former DEA employee, who he did not name.

The Washington Post and the CBS program “60 Minutes” published an investigation on Sunday that showed Marino had worked to weaken federal efforts to slow the flow of opioid drugs.

The legislation championed by Marino, which was passed by Congress and signed into law last year by Democratic President Barack Obama, was the product of a drug industry quest to weaken the DEA’s authority to stem the flow of painkillers to the black market, according to the report.

The law made it almost impossible for the DEA to freeze suspicious narcotics shipments, according to government documents cited by the Post.

Trump has been criticized for his response to the opioid epidemic. He has yet to declare it a national emergency as he pledged to do on Aug. 10 following a recommendation by a presidential commission.

Asked about that at a news conference on Monday, Trump said he would make the declaration next week. Such a move would boost funding for various forms of treatment and give the government more flexibility in taking steps to expedite action.

Nine months into his presidency, Trump has not named a chief for the Drug Enforcement Administration, currently headed by an acting administrator.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available. Estimates show the death rate has continued rising.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Marino’s withdrawal “the right decision,” but added that “the fact that he was nominated in the first place is further evidence that when it comes to the opioid crisis, the Trump administration talks the talk, but refuses to walk the walk.”

NEW INDICTMENTS

No. 2 U.S. Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein, asked about the Marino-backed law during a news conference announcing indictments against accused Chinese fentanyl traffickers, said the Trump administration would review the law.

Rosenstein said he was “not prepared to answer” whether the administration would ask Congress to repeal it.

“We are going to look into these issues ... about what tools DEA has available to it. And if we conclude they don’t have the appropriate tools, then we will seek more tools,” Rosenstein said.

The Justice Department announced the indictments of two major Chinese drug traffickers on charges of illegally making and selling fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid painkiller, over the internet to Americans.

The department said it charged Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, with conspiring to distribute large quantities of fentanyl and chemically similar drugs. It said Zhang’s actions led to four deaths.

Trump’s opioid commission, headed by Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, cited government data showing that since 1999 U.S. opioid overdoses have quadrupled, adding that nearly two-thirds of U.S. drug overdoses were linked to opioids such as heroin and the powerful painkillers Percocet, OxyContin and fentanyl.",Trump's drug czar nominee withdraws from consideration,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-opioid/trumps-drug-czar-nominee-withdraws-from-consideration-idUSKBN1CM1UC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who reached the agreement with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, said Trump had “completely engineered” the proposal.

The agreement would provide billions of dollars of subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Trump last week announced he would end the subsidies, potentially creating chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.

“I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O‘Care,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

In another setback, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan indicated no interest in the Alexander-Murray agreement.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

While the proposal drew broad Democratic support, it remained unclear whether the agreement will even come to a vote in the Senate and House, both controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority but other than Alexander, Susan Collins and John McCain are the only Republican senators who have publicly embraced the plan.

On Tuesday, Trump had indicated support of the agreement during a news conference, saying the White House had been involved in the negotiations and that the agreement would be a “short-term solution” that would “get us over this intermediate hump.”

During Tuesday’s news conference, he also made clear that he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and that he still considered the subsidies a government handout that had enriched insurance companies.

He also told a conservative think thank, “While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray ... I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

The Trump administration followed through on the president’s plan to end the subsidies and did not make a payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to insurers that had been scheduled for Wednesday.

MORE FLEXIBILITY

The Alexander-Murray proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The subsidies compensate private insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses for low-income customers. They are known as cost-sharing reduction payments.

At an event sponsored by the news website Axios shortly before Trump posted his tweet on Wednesday, Alexander said, “Trump completely engineered the plan that we announced yesterday.”

“He wanted a bipartisan bill for the short term,” Alexander added.

Collins, a moderate who helped kill earlier Senate efforts to repeal and replace the healthcare law, said she did not know if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would schedule a vote but told CNN, “If it comes to the floor, I think the votes are there.”

The president’s move last week to discontinue subsidies was part of his effort to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through executive actions because his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Trump said on Tuesday he wanted lawmakers, once they have completed work on his tax-cut proposal, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Republicans, describing Obamacare as ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy, have sought for seven years to repeal and replace it. Scrapping the law was also a top Trump campaign pledge.

Democrats have fought to defend Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

BEIJING (Reuters) - In his baseball cap and baggy yellow t-shirt, the rap star Li Yijie - better known by his stage name “Pissy” - is an unlikely face of China’s strait-laced ruling Communist Party.

His group, Tianfu Shibian, has won fans and the support of the party’s youth league with songs like “Force of Red” and “This is China” that chime with President Xi Jinping’s nationalist vision of China and its place in the world.

Under Xi, set to begin a second five-year term at a key party congress next month, the once-hidebound Communist Party has sought to revitalise its role in society amid challenges to its traditional authority as the country gets richer, more mobile and more digitally connected.

The party's modernising push also comes as a significant number of educated Chinese millennials, faced with a tough job market and high housing costs in big cities, have grown disillusioned about their career and life prospects.

The party’s effort extends increasingly to co-opting swathes of Chinese popular culture, such as Tianfu Shibian. At the same time, the government is cracking down on online content and entertainment that strays beyond the narrowing definitions of what is acceptable.

If the Party “sticks to the old ways, it will only be more and more rejected by young people,” said Li, 23, whose band’s name means “Tianfu Incident”. Tianfu refers to the region around Chengdu, the band’s home city in western Sichuan province.

“We need to stand up and say: Why can’t younger folks be more patriotic?” he said during an interview in Beijing.

“We need to step into this system,” he said. “If the post-1990 generations don’t enter the system, what is our country going to do?” said Li.

Beijing has the same idea.

It has latched onto other acts like TFBOYS, a wholesome boy band whose three members each have nearly 30 million followers on the popular microblog Weibo, to help spread the Party message. The band often appears at Youth League events.

“This kind of propaganda is a step forward that better suits the demands of its audience,” said Qiao Mu, a media researcher and former professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University.

“Ordinary people are now rejecting the old preaching ways of the People’s Daily newspaper and CCTV News,” he said, referring to the Party’s official newspaper and China’s state broadcaster.

On its Bilibili account - a video site popular with China’s post 1990s generation - the Communist Youth League has posted hundreds of videos this year interspersing patriotic raps with more traditional fare such as defence ministry briefings.

One such “guichu” – a fast-paced clip of repeated images, sounds and catchy music – calls on citizens to be on the lookout and report people they suspect are spies to the authorities.

‘FORCE OF RED’

Tianfu Shibian shot to prominence in 2016 voicing patriotic values in sometimes expletive-filled songs.

“Force of Red” attacked Tsai Ing-Wen, the president of Taiwan, an independently governed island that Beijing considers a renegade province.

“There’s only one China, HK, Taipei, they are my fellas,” ran the lyrics of the song in English, along with expletives aimed at Tsai and her government: “Far away from us you forget how to act. Even dogs know to come home with a thankful bark.”

The music video went viral, racking up more than 7 million views on the band’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo feed and catching the attention of the Communist Youth League, a training ground for elite cadres within the 90-million-strong Communist Party.

The group’s next outing - “This is China” - came with production support from a Youth League-backed music studio, though the band says there was no other financial backing.

The party connection deepened in September last year when Beijing sent the band to Woody Island, in a disputed area of the South China Sea, to film a music video rebuking an international tribunal ruling that rejected China’s claims in the area.

Li said the group now has ties across China’s propaganda related agencies, and frequently dines with officials to exchange ideas. In return they’ve cleaned up their act to fit with Beijing’s drive towards more wholesome content.

While their songs are unabashedly pro-China, Tianfu Shibian’s lyrics also touch on problems in contemporary China, including tainted food, corruption, and pollution.

“Critique with rationality has its place in our songs, but we despise those who keep complaining blindly,” Li told Reuters.

Not everyone is a fan.

A song by the band praising the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong was criticised online as glossing over China’s Cultural Revolution, a period of chaos and violence between 1966-1976 in which some historians estimate as many as 1.5 million people died.

Others online have dismissed the band as a propaganda machine, calling it “wumao” - roughly “50-cents” - a reference to those paid by the government to post patriotic comments online.

AT THE FRINGES

While countercultural or subversive art has long been at the fringes in China, it has all-but been extinguished in the Xi era, with censors banning not only politically incorrect material but also clamping down on negativity.

China’s most internationally recognised artist, Ai Weiwei, a fierce critic of Beijing, spent time under house arrest and finally left China in 2015. He had helped design Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest” stadium for the 2008 Olympics.

Erstwhile rock and roll rebels have cleaned up their acts to placate censors or been sidelined.

Zuoxiao Zuzhou - a music producer who was banned by the government from 2011-2014 for his connection to Ai Weiwei - is one who has chosen to toe the government line.

“With great difficulty,” Zuoxiao Zuzhou “has now established an image that is relatively acceptable to society,” his agent, Qin Baogui, told Reuters, declining an interview with the artist because of the sensitivity of the topic.

Cui Jian, whose 1986 “Nothing to My Name” became an unofficial anthem for students demonstrating during the deadly 1989 Tiananmen protests, pulled out of a show on Chinese state television in 2014 because he was told he would not be allowed to sing the song, his manager said at the time.

On the flip side, films and music that embrace the party have benefited from state support to tap China’s huge fan bases.

The overtly patriotic “Wolf Warrior 2” became China’s top grossing film after its July release, helped in part by strong state media support.

Last month, U.S. organizers aiming to bring Grammy Award artists to China said they would only “promote artists with a positive and healthy image.”

As for Li, he is currently working on a song in the run-up to next month’s Communist Party Congress, called “A Letter to President Xi Jinping.”

However, Li has not joined the party himself - though it’s some distance from youthful rebellion.

“It’s too troublesome and complicated to write an application letter,” he said.",Insight: Rap and the Party: China taps youth culture to hook millennial cadres,https://www.reuters.com/article/china-congress-entertainment/insight-rap-and-the-party-china-taps-youth-culture-to-hook-millennial-cadres-idUSKCN1C00HC

LONDON (Reuters) - A push by European Union countries to grab a slice of London’s financial sector ahead of Brexit could backfire by raising costs for consumers and companies on the continent, the UK’s main banking industry body said on Wednesday.

Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg want to attract banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain who need an EU base by March 2019 to maintain links with European customers. France is also keen to take on some clearing of euro-denominated derivatives moving to the EU from London after Brexit.

“We detect some degree of political will in certain parts of continental Europe in order to reclaim what they perceive to be 20 years loss of wholesale financial services to the London market,” Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, told a House of Lords committee.

However, Jones said, fragmenting markets could bump up costs significantly for consumers and companies on the continent.

“It’s a very short sighted approach to negotiations, but I recognise that in certain markets it’s the political reality,” he said.

Jones and others urged MPs not to fight back by ditching some EU financial rules when they slot the bloc’s regulations into UK law in the Withdrawal Bill now before parliament.

Some MPs have said Brexit is an opportunity to scrap EU rules which they see as crimping London’s global competitiveness in finance.

Financial sector officials worry that too much divergence with EU rules would mean no market access to the bloc after Brexit.

Mark Hoban, chair of the International Regulatory Strategy Group, a think tank backed by the City of London and TheCityUK lobby, said financial firms want predictability and not a “bonfire of regulations”.

“My concern would be... that if this bill is used as an opportunity to unpick regulation, that would be to the detriment of that stability and certainty,” Hoban said.

“The key concern that we hear from the sector is for clarity, certainty and stability, and just knowing there aren’t going to be tweaks and changes,” added Catherine McGuinness, head of policy at the City of London.

Jones said Britain should wait until it has agreed new trading terms with the EU before changing any rules.

The financial sector has called on the government to quickly agree a “standstill” transition period, during which Britain complies with EU rules to minimise job moves to the bloc.

British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she expects to agree new trading terms by March 2019, which Jones said his members were taking with a “pinch of salt”.",Banks say EU's grab for London's financial sector could backfire,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-banks/banks-say-eus-grab-for-londons-financial-sector-could-backfire-idUKKBN1CN1ZC

LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Theresa May will make a pitch to fellow EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday as she tries to break a deadlock in Brexit talks that has left Britain’s future trading position up in the air.

But EU officials expect no movement in negotiating positions from either side before the other 27 leaders deliver a verdict on progress on Friday that will say Britain must up its offer on divorce terms before they will even talk about trade.

“We do not expect at this stage any new initiatives between now and the European Council,” said an EU official, who said May had asked to address the summit.

The others will not negotiate with her but will discuss Brexit after May leaves on Friday.

They plan to reject her call for an immediate start to talks on a future trade relationship but make a “gesture” recognizing the concessions May offered in a speech at Florence last month by telling EU staff to prepare for talks on a transition period.

Stepping personally into the breach after Brexit Secretary David Davis’s four months of discussions struck deadlock last week, May had dinner in Brussels on Monday with EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and his negotiator Michel Barnier.

But she came away with just a joint pledge to “accelerate” the process.

There is a catch: the EU will not discuss relations in the future until London agrees to pay tens of billions of euros (dollars) in a divorce settlement for obligations incurred in the past. May, beset by demands from hardline Brexit supporters to simply walk away without any deal, says the bill can be worked out only when the future relationship is clearer.

“It takes two to accelerate,” Barnier told reporters as he arrived to brief EU ministers in Luxembourg. “One step after another... We are not finished with the first step.”

May’s spokesman said she was pleased with a dinner that ended with an embrace at the door from Juncker. But he added: “We can only resolve the financial implications of the UK’s withdrawal ... as part of the settlement of all the issues.”

MERKEL-MACRON FRONT

May came away similarly empty-handed from telephone calls to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, leaders of the Union’s leading powers whose diplomats have taken a hard line this month in limiting the scope of the gesture on transition preparations which Barnier had proposed.

People familiar with those calls on Sunday and Monday said May echoed emotional complaints from British negotiators last week that her Florence speech, offering to “honor commitments” made by Britain, deserved a more generous response from the EU.

Macron and Merkel, who are coordinating closely, were clear that they will negotiate at the stage only through Barnier, a former French foreign minister, officials said.

And they insisted Britain settled outstanding issues first, despite increasingly vocal calls from business on both sides of the English Channel for clarity by early next year at the latest in order to plan investments for after Brexit in March 2019.

BusinessEurope, which represents employers federations across the continent including Britain’s CBI, was the latest, saying it was “extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations” and telling EU summit chair Donald Tusk in a letter that “business wants to avoid a cliff edge”.

EU leaders plan to issue a statement after May leaves on Friday saying that they hope a deal can be struck at their next summit in December and that things can move swiftly then.

But after losing her majority in June, May has little room for maneuver at home: “It’s all about the money and if she ups the bid now, that is a really hard sell politically,” a senior source in her Conservative Party told Reuters.

British efforts to remind continental neighbors of how much they also have to lose if trade is disrupted are showing little return, even among close trading partners with most at stake.

“Sometimes it’s very difficult to see and understand what Britain really wants from these negotiations,” Finnish minister Samuli Virtanen said.

Brexit minister Davis, who long campaigned to take Britain out of the EU, said London had no plan to walk away from talks but should maintain the option in negotiations. Yet interior minister Amber Rudd, who opposed Brexit in the referendum, said shortly afterward that it was “unthinkable” that the two sides would fail to strike a deal as it was in their own interests.",May to pitch on Brexit at EU summit dinner,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/may-to-pitch-on-brexit-at-eu-summit-dinner-idUKKBN1CM2O5?il=0

ERBIL (Reuters) - The Kurdish independence vote championed by their leader Masoud Barzani was a gamble that may have made his quest for a homeland more elusive than ever.

The Sept 25 vote won overwhelming backing for secession but has raised the possibility of a new civil war in Iraq that could draw in regional powers. Baghdad says the vote is illegal.

Just a few months ago, the Iraqi army, Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, and Iranian-backed Shi‘ite paramilitary forces worked together to defeat Islamic State in Mosul.

But that cooperation was short-lived and on Monday Iraqi forces seized Kirkuk -- an important oil town for the OPEC producer that is also considered by the Kurds to be the heart of their homeland.

Iran and Turkey oppose Kurdish independence and Shi‘ite militias funded by Tehran are gaining influence across Iraq. Meanwhile divisions between the two parties in the ruling Kurdish coalition have deepened.

“Kurds have been managing these areas since the fall of (Iraqi President) Saddam (Hussein) in 2003 and to change the situation in an instant will make the whole situation as if it is sinking into quicksand,” said Baghdad-based analyst Jasim al-Bahadli, an expert on Shi’ite armed groups.

He said the Shi’ite paramilitary groups’ presence in areas that used to be controlled by Kurds will help create tensions that could lead to a long-term conflict.

”Sensitivities could develop into hostilities that could spark a civil war,” he said.

LEADERSHIP CRISIS

Barzani and his Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) have defended the referendum.

“It was the right move. No one will stop us from achieving independence,” his spokesman Vahal Ali said.

But not all of Iraq’s Kurds, who fought a bloody civil war amongst themselves in the 1990s, supported the idea, raising doubts over the management of any independent state.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said the KDP, who make up the coalition, were putting Kurds at risk because of strong opposition to the vote, including from key ally the United States.

The Peshmerga General Command in the KDP stronghold of Erbil accused Iran, a historical ally of the PUK, of helping Iraqi forces launch the offensive in the Kirkuk area.

“Unfortunately some of the PUK officials betrayed Kurdistan by being part of the plan by abandoning key fronts and leaving…,” said the Peshmerga statement.

“This plot will fail and the will of our people will prevail.”

Ali Akbar Velayati - a top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - was quoted in a report by Tasnim news agency as saying Iran had no role in the Kirkuk operations.

A senior Western diplomat also denied that Iran had played a role.

“This is mythology. Barzani has in the past blamed others for his mistakes including the PUK. But this is mythology designed to get support from the Americans,” he said.

PUK leader Jalal Talabani died barely a week after the vote, adding more uncertainty for the Kurds.

Shuras Sherko Jdy, an official in the main opposition Kurdish Gorran Movement, said the Kurds, who gradually built an autonomous region in the north after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, were facing a leadership crisis.

“Civil war could take place over Kirkuk. I hope it does not. If it does it will encourage the intervention of Iran and Turkey,” he said.

TEHRAN‘S AMBITIONS

But Iran, like Turkey, worries the vote will encourage their own Kurdish populations to push for homelands and has made no secret of its growing ambitions in Iraq.

The most prominent Iranian figure in Iraq is Major General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of foreign operations for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, a military corp providing training and weapons to Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi‘ite-led government in Baghdad.

Ali said Soleimani appeared in Kirkuk two nights before Iraqi security forces attacked. That account was confirmed by an Iranian source in Iraq who said he appeared for “a couple of hours there to give military guidance.”

“Tehran’s military help is not a secret anymore. You can find General Soleimani’s pictures in Iraq everywhere,” said an official close to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

“Now, beside political issues, Kirkuk’s oil is a very key element for Iran, which is an OPEC member. Control of those oil fields by Iran’s enemies, would be disastrous for us. Why should we let them enter the oil market?.”

Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire and left Kurdish-populated territory split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

They have often accused the West of not helping them during times of trouble. President Donald Trump has said the United States would not take sides in the clash.

Some fear the referendum, which gave Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi a chance to assert his authority, has put independence further out of reach.

Baghdad has also banned international flights to Kurdish airports and imposed punitive financial measures.

“We used to control our own airports. We used to control our own borders. We were running our own autonomous region...Now we have nothing. Barzani is responsible for this,” said Jdy.",Analysis: Vote may have put independence out of reach for Iraqi Kurds,https://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds/analysis-vote-may-have-put-independence-out-of-reach-for-iraqi-kurds-idINKBN1CN1OR

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

But while money will unite leaders at this week’s European summit, it will divide them after Brexit.

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the “reste ὰ liquider” (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill. But once Britain leaves, the bickering over money will begin – and the push toward a stronger union could be tougher than ever to achieve.",Commentary: How money will divide Europe after Brexit,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-brexit-commentary/commentary-how-money-will-divide-europe-after-brexit-idUKKBN1CM2BN

(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) quarterly results beat estimates and the company raised the top end of its full-year earnings forecast range on Wednesday, as a string of recent deals and medical device approvals help spur growth in its largest unit.

The company has acquired several rivals this year, including St. Jude Medical and Alere, to bolster its medical devices business, and favorable tax laws in India are boosting its generics business.

The company’s shares rose 2.8 percent to $56.60 to a record in morning trading.

The generics unit, which sells drugs in emerging markets, brought in sales of $1.17 billion, up 16 percent.

Sales in India, a key market for the company, were helped as the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax prompted inventory restocking.

Abbott said it now expects full-year adjusted 2017 profit from continuing operations of $2.48-$2.50 per share, compared with its previous range of $2.43-$2.53.

Chief Financial Officer Brian Yoor said he expects the recently closed Alere deal to contribute around $475 million to reported sales this year.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

There is a saying in China that describes what it can sometimes feel like to be a reporter here: guăn zhōng kuī bào. Peeping at a leopard through a pipe. You may see one of its spots clearly, and sometimes a few, but it can be a tricky to take in the whole animal.

As the 19th Communist Party Congress approaches, and with it another five years (at least) of Xi Jinping as China’s top leader, Reuters wanted to gain a better understanding of life in Xi’s China.

The economy has slowed, debt levels and property prices have continued to soar, and governmental controls have been tightened on NGOs, online videos and much more. But where do you go to deepen the view of life in a vast country with 1.4 billion citizens?

At Reuters, the bread and butter of our China coverage is talking to politicians, business executives and investors. For this project, we took a different approach, focusing our reporting on young, educated adults who were just entering society when Xi took power in 2012.

They are the first generation born and raised in the post-Tiananmen era, a period marked by historic economic gains and political and social stability. Since graduating, they have started building families and careers. They face numerous challenges as China modernizes.

How this generation adjusts, adapts and leads the country in the years to come will be pivotal.

Tapping our network of sources, Reuters journalists ultimately zeroed in on about a dozen people. Five reporters were involved – in text, TV and pictures. We traveled to Chengdu, in the southwest, and Wuhan in central China, for interviews. Others were conducted in Shanghai and Beijing, where Reuters has bureaus.

It can often be tough to get Chinese people to speak on the record, even about seemingly innocuous subjects. While they were generally less than loquacious on the sensitive topic of politics, the people we profile were more than happy to talk at length about themselves – their childhoods, families, jobs, dreams.

For example, Qin Lijuan trained to be an animator in Chengdu, but always had money on her mind. She found a job selling golf memberships around China. Once that job became untenable after Xi targeted extravagant behavior, Qin, 28, returned to her hometown of Nanchong, where she experienced culture shock: her love of morning coffee raised eyebrows as an extravagance. Today she is running a team of financial advisers.

Hu Ruixin trained to design advertisements but works as a computer technician. Before this, he was a wedding planner. One of his proudest professional achievements was organizing a Barcelona Football Club-themed wedding replete with decorations in the team’s red and blue colors.

Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Angoor Adda, PAKISTAN (Reuters) - Pakistan is betting that a pair of nine-foot chicken wire fences topped with barbed wire will stop incursions by Islamist militants from Afghanistan, which opposes Islamabad’s plans for a barrier along the disputed frontier.

Pakistan plans to fence up most of the 2,500 km (1,500 mile) frontier despite Kabul’s protests that the barrier would divide families and friends along the Pashtun tribal belt straddling the colonial-era Durand line drawn up by the British in 1893.

Pakistan’s military estimates that it will need about 56 billion rupees ($532 million) for the project, while there are also plans to build 750 border forts and employ high-tech surveillance systems to prevent militants crossing.

In the rolling hills of the Angoor Adda village in South Waziristan, part of Pakistan’s restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), three rolls of barbed wire are sandwiched in the six-foot gap between the chicken wire fences.

“(The fence) is a paradigm change. It is an epoch shift in the border control management,” said a Pakistani army officer in command of South Waziristan during a presentation to foreign media on Wednesday.

“There will not be an inch of international border (in South Waziristan) which shall not remain under our observation.”

Pakistan’s military has so far fenced off about 43 km of the frontier, starting with the most violence-prone areas in FATA, and is expected to recruit tens of thousands of new troops to man the border. It is not clear how long it will take to fence the entire boundary.

But Pakistan’s plans have also drawn criticism from across the border.

Gulab Mangal, governor of the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, told Reuters the wall will create “more hatred and resentment” between two neighbors and will do neither country any good.

“The fence will definitely create a lot of trouble for the people along the border on both sides but no wall or fence can separate these tribes,” he said.

“I urge the tribes to stand against this action.”

Pakistan has blamed Pakistani Taliban militants it says are based on Afghan soil for a spate of attacks at home over the past year, urging Kabul to eradicate “sanctuaries” for militants.

Afghanistan, in turn, accuses Islamabad of sheltering the leadership of the Afghan Taliban militants who are battling the Western-backed government in Kabul.

Both countries deny aiding militants, but relations between the two have soured in recent years. In May, the tension rose when 10 people were killed in two border villages in Baluchistan region.

The clashes occurred in so-called “divided villages”, where the Durand Line goes through the heart of the community, and where residents are now bracing for the fence to split their villages in two. [nL8N1MK146]

Pakistan’s previous attempts to build a fence failed about a decade ago and many doubt whether its possible to secure such a lengthy border.

But Pakistani army officials are undeterred by the scepticism and insist they will finish the job as the country’s security rests on this fence.

“By the time we are done, inshallah, we will be very sure of one thing: that nobody can cross this place,” said the Pakistani officer in charge of South Waziristan.

But lawmakers have already proposed several amendments to the bill, including some to hand parliament a vote at the end of the negotiating process with the EU and others to reduce the amount of power the government gives itself to amend laws.

Asked whether the government was planning to introduce the legislation into the so-called committee phase of its lengthy passage towards the statute book in November, her spokesman told reporters: “We haven’t yet confirmed a date for the bill at the committee stage.”

“But the leader of the house will set out (next week’s business) tomorrow,” he added, referring to a weekly procedure when the government sets out its agenda, which may, or may not, include the EU withdrawal bill.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility.
Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll.","Unlike the nerve-jangling elections earlier this year in the Netherlands, France and Britain, Germany’s has been notably dull. The country that invented “Sturm und Drang” is showing a distinct lack of storm and stress as Angela Merkel heads towards a fourth term as chancellor.

That seemingly inexorable outcome on Sept. 24 has raised hopes that she will push through greater integration within the euro area, in partnership with French president Emmanuel Macron, while also championing the rules-based international order that America has forsaken under Donald Trump. But Merkel will find it hard to satisfy such expectations, since she will face new political constraints at home, while the basis for her authority, German economic strength, will come under increasing strain.

A string of polls suggests that the politics of Merkel’s fourth term will be tricky. The chancellor is a long way ahead but she is not doing as well as in the last election, in 2013. Recent findings show support for her center-right CDU party (together with the CSU in Bavaria) at around 36 percent, down from the 41.5 percent she managed four years ago. Because of Germany’s electoral system, which broadly aligns the distribution of seats in the Bundestag with the parties’ share of the vote – while excluding those that fail to reach a 5 percent voting threshold - she will once again have to form a coalition.

The most stable government would be another “grand coalition” with the center-left SPD, her current partner, which is currently polling at around 22 percent. That might appeal to the SPD leadership but many party members are opposed to playing second fiddle again, not least since this does not pay off at the polls. If Merkel cannot form a coalition with the SPD, she may have to form a coalition with not just one but two smaller parties, the FDP and the Greens. This combination would be a first in the Bundestag and it could prove fissile by bringing together the free-market FDP, Merkel’s junior partner in her second term of office between 2009 and 2013, with Germany’s environmentalist party, which has in the past allied itself with the SPD.

The coalition arithmetic could change if the election throws up surprise results for the smaller parties. But whatever alliance Merkel forms after probably protracted negotiations, it will face a disturbing new political phenomenon. Until now the Bundestag has been immune from the upsurge of populism in Europe. But the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) looks set to break through the 5 percent threshold that held it at bay in 2013. Currently polling around 10 percent, it has mutated from its euroskeptic origins into an anti-immigration party, capitalizing upon concerns about the influx of asylum-seekers in 2015. Though riven by internal divisions and shunned by the other parties, the AfD will be able to use its presence in the Bundestag as a platform for its populist opposition to the chancellor’s policies.

The politics of Merkel’s fourth term may be more unfavorable than before, but that should be surmountable if the economy – her trump card in the election - remains buoyant. Growth prospects for this year and next year are good, continuing a robust performance in the chancellor’s last two terms. Manufacturers excel in exporting the high-quality engineering products in which Germany specializes. The current-account surplus is extraordinarily high at around 8 percent of GDP. Helped by the humming economy and low interest rates on government debt, Germany boasts healthy public finances too, running a surplus of almost 1 percent of GDP.

Peter Apps: The coming robot arms race

John Lloyd: Labor reform in France's Macron economy

German economic and fiscal strength, so crucial in underpinning the euro zone during the crisis years of 2010-12, has come to be taken for granted. Yet under the shiny paint the engine looks less reliable for the longer journey ahead. Much of the economy does not match the prowess of German manufacturers. In particular Germany lags in business services, as a report from the OECD pointed out last year. Many professions are subject to restrictions that fetter competition. Germany is overbanked with too many small lenders and the banking sector has unhelpfully high levels of public ownership.

Moreover, the business model of German manufacturing is under threat. The diesel emissions scandal that began when Volkswagen admitted cheating U.S. emissions tests has cast a shadow over the country’s premier industry and German carmakers’ big bet on the fuel now looks misplaced. They have to scramble to catch up with electric-powered models, whose time has come thanks both to technological advances and a wave of public-health measures led by cities to ban polluting vehicles. The self-driving revolution poses another challenge to German carmakers. Manufacturers fret that they may be on the wrong side of the digital divide, with Silicon Valley in effect grabbing the high value-added content of many products.

Germans are proud of their massive current-account surplus, yet the domestic counterpart is a lack of investment to absorb national savings. The government’s drive to balance the books has come at the cost of inadequate capital spending on the national infrastructure. Business investment has been subdued. Indeed, according to the OECD’s survey, German firms are behind those of other advanced countries in investing in the “knowledge-based capital”, such as software and management skills, that is increasingly important in spurring greater efficiency. That is one reason why productivity growth has been weak.

An underlying and profound weakness is that Germany’s demographics are especially unfavorable in economic terms. At almost 46, the median age of the population in 2015 was only just lower than Japan’s, the world’s oldest, according to UN data released in June. Although there was a baby boom from the mid-1950s through most of the 1960s, the birth rate fell below the replacement level (of 2.1 children per woman) at the start of the 1970s and has since been among the lowest in the world; indeed the current fertility rate of 1.5 is unusually high. These persistently low birth rates mean that there are fewer young people to replace the bulge of baby-boomers as they retire. Despite the recent upsurge in immigration the working-age population is set to fall, which will act as a persistent drag on growth by reducing the number of workers over the next couple of decades.

For the moment, Merkel still has the aura of invincibility. Yet in practice she will find the going tougher in her fourth term as political, economic and demographic vulnerabilities take their toll. That will limit her ability to meet the exaggerated expectations of what she can achieve both within Europe and on the wider international stage.",Commentary: Don’t be fooled by Merkel’s aura of invincibility,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallace-germany-commentary/commentary-dont-be-fooled-by-merkels-aura-of-invincibility-idUSKCN1BU2BJ

Rajoy issued his appeal in the national parliament, where he sought to win more political support for taking direct control of Catalonia on Thursday if the rebel regional government sticks to a plan to break away.

The move would need only a vote in Spain’s upper house, where Rajoy’s People’s Party holds an absolute majority.

It would be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that direct rule has been imposed.

A constitutional provision allows the central government to impose the law by giving orders to all branches of the regional authorities. Precisely how that would work in practical matters such as commanding the police force is untested.

Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers.

Many Spaniards fear the unprecedented step could lead to social unrest. The crisis has prompted hundreds of Catalan firms to move their headquarters, led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts and weighed on the euro.

In the latest grim prediction, Spain’s independent budget watchdog warned on Wednesday that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off the economy next year, reducing expected growth by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points.

Puigdemont has already defied Madrid once this week, reiterating on Monday an ambiguous independence declaration he made last week and immediately suspended.

“I ask Puigdemont to act sensibly, in a balanced way, to put the interests of all citizens first,” Rajoy said on Wednesday, mentioning both residents of the autonomous region, which produces a fifth of Spain’s wealth and has its own language and culture, and the rest of the country.

Thursday’s deadline is Puigdemont’s last chance to abandon an independence declaration which Madrid has rejected as illegal, and defuse Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

“It’s not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not we can talk here,” Rajoy said in parliament.

The row has rattled financial markets and sent companies scurrying to relocate on safer ground. Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, was considering moving its top management to Madrid.

Almost 700 companies pulled out of the northeastern region between Oct. 2 - the day after a referendum on independence which Madrid branded illegal - and Oct. 16, according to Spain’s companies registry.

Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centered on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday.

The region’s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter “if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months”, Exceltur said in a statement.

THREAT OF DIRECT RULE

Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that exactly what direct rule would look like is not clear, adding the government would work on it.

La Vanguardia said Puigdemont, a 54-year-old former journalist, was mulling declaring independence and calling so-called constituent elections for the newly-declared republic.

But Catalan foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told a news conference in Brussels: “Elections are not on the table now.”

As the threat of direct rule neared, the Catalan government took a combative tone.

“Giving in forms no part of this government’s scenarios,” spokesman Jordi Turull said on Tuesday. “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”

Tempers have flared since the jailing on Monday of two separatist leaders pending an investigation for alleged sedition.

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona’s Diagonal Avenue on Tuesday to call for their release, whistling and shouting “freedom” and “out with the occupying forces”.

Puigdemont said: “Sadly, we have political prisoners again,” referring to the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who suppressed Catalan culture and language until his death in 1975.",Spain asks Catalan leader to 'act sensibly' as direct rule deadline nears,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CN0VR

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Luxury electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and labour leaders at its German engineering unit have agreed a new pay structure that will raise workers’ salaries by about 30 percent from current levels, the division’s works council said.

“We will now get to a competitive wage level,” a spokesman for the works council said on Wednesday after a staff gathering at Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH, based in western Germany.

“The workforce was informed today that we will introduce a pay structure” at Grohmann, which has about 650 workers, he said, without elaborating.

In an emailed statement, Tesla said the new remuneration structure, retroactively effective from Oct. 1, guarantees staff “a fair and competitive salary” and will include a pay raise for apprenticeships, but it did not confirm the 30 percent figure.

In April, Tesla pledged a 5-year job guarantee for all Grohmann employees up to at least 2022. Workers also received a 10,000-euro (£8,940) grant each of Tesla stock and an additional bonus of 1,000 euros with their April pay and a monthly salary increase of 150 euros, it said.

Tesla faces higher wage costs in Germany as it wrestles with what Chief Executive Elon Musk has described as “production hell” in launching its new Model 3 sedan, which Tesla hopes will make it a mass-market producer.

The company warned earlier this month that production bottlenecks had left the company behind with its planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

German daily newspaper Die Welt reported the wage pact earlier on Wednesday.

Before being bought by Tesla last year, Grohmann, based in the town of Pruem near the Luxembourg border, helped clients build highly automated and efficient factories, including battery assembly lines for electric cars.

The U.S. carmaker is counting on Grohmann’s automation and engineering expertise to help it ramp up production to 500,000 cars per year by 2018 through the design of ultra-efficient factories.",Tesla to raise pay by 30 percent at German division - works council,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-tesla-germany-wages/tesla-to-raise-pay-by-30-percent-at-german-division-works-council-idUKKBN1CN283

Appealing for information to help identify the conman, Branson said he suspected the same person had later impersonated him to steal $2 million from a friend of his by pretending to raise funds for people affected by Hurricane Irma.

“This story sounds like it has come straight out of a John le Carre book or a James Bond film, but it is sadly all true,” Branson wrote in a blog.

Instantly recognizable with his wavy blond hair and beard, Branson is one of Britain’s best-known businessmen. The Virgin brand is licensed for use by a range of businesses from airlines to train companies to telecoms and gyms.

Branson wrote that six months ago, after an elaborate set-up involving a note on fake government notepaper, he spoke on the phone to someone purporting to be Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

The man told Branson that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom by terrorists.

He said that while the government did not pay ransoms, there was a particularly sensitive reason why the diplomat had to be saved, and the government was confidentially asking a syndicate of British business people to step in.

“I was asked to contribute $5 million of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back,” Branson wrote.

Feeling suspicious, Branson checked with the government and was told that Fallon had not spoken to him. The matter was reported to the police.

Six months on, Branson learnt that a friend, whom he described as a very successful businessman in the United States, had been called by a conman posing as him.

“When the call happened, the conman did an extremely accurate impression of me and spun a big lie about urgently needing a loan while I was trying to mobilize aid in the BVI (British Virgin Islands),” he wrote.

Branson owns a small island in the BVI archipelago which, as was well publicized, was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The caller took advantage of that context.

“They claimed I couldn’t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn’t have any communications going to Europe and I’d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America,” Branson wrote.

“The business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2 million, which promptly disappeared.”

A spokesman for Fallon said he was aware of two attempts, one not involving Branson, to impersonate the minister for illicit gain, and Fallon’s office were assisting the police in their efforts to try to catch those responsible.",Billionaire Branson targeted in $5 million scam 'straight out of le Carre',https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CN1AC-OCATP

Hochtief is offering 18.76 euros in cash, or 0.1281 Hochtief shares, for each Abertis share and has set a minimum acceptance threshold of 50 percent plus one share.

Builder ACS is launching the bid via cash-positive Hochtief to protect its credit rating and avoid having to raise equity itself, though Hochtief’s plan to issue up to 24.8 million shares would dilute ACS’s 72 percent stake in the German firm.

The move creates a dilemma for Abertis, which has also received a cash and shares offer from Atlantia worth around 15.7 billion euros on a comparable basis, according to analysts.

A tie-up between Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, and Abertis would create the world’s biggest toll-roads operator and help both companies in their drive to branch out from their home markets.

However, a source close to ACS - whose chairman Florentino Perez also heads Real Madrid soccer club - has told Reuters that its bid has the backing of the Spanish government, which may be reluctant to see Abertis’s politically sensitive motorways concessions in Spain fall into foreign hands.

A previous deal between Atlantia and Abertis fell through in 2006 due to opposition from the Italian government.

Atlantia launched its cash and shares bid in May, and people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week it was prepared to raise it if ACS - as expected - triggered a takeover battle.

“Hochtief’s offer is very competitive, but we would expect Atlantia to fight for Abertis as this is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” a Milan-based trader said.

At 1430 GMT, Abertis shares were up 7.1 percent at 18.89 euros. ACS’s were up 4.6 percent at 32.88 euros, Hochtief’s up 2.5 percent at 153.3 euros and Atlantia’s down 1.4 percent at 26.86 euros.

ON HOLD

Hochtief said Abertis would complement its business by adding the operation and maintenance of infrastructure to its developing and building operations, allowing it to “generate value throughout the entire infrastructure project life cycle.”

Hochtief has secured financing of 15 billion euros at a 2 percent interest rate and is planning to pay out up to 90 percent of its profit to shareholders after a successful Abertis bid, it said.

Atlantia’s bid has cleared all regulators and, according to two Italian sources, has the non-binding backing of investors representing more than 50 percent of Abertis’s capital.

But one of the sources said Abertis’ top investor, Criteria Caixa - the financial arm of a politically connected and powerful banking foundation - had not committed to taking up Atlantia’s offer. Criteria has a 22.3 percent stake in Abertis.

Hochtief’s bid puts Atlantia’s offer, which began on Oct. 10 and was due to run through Oct. 24, on hold. Spanish market watchdog CNMV now has to examine Hochtief’s offer and decide whether it can go ahead.

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has interviewed several top prospects for the post of Chair of the Federal Reserve. A nomination could come within weeks as the term of current Chair Janet Yellen ends in February 2018.

Yellen will meet with Trump about the job on Thursday.

(For a graphic on the next chair of the Federal Reserve, click tmsnrt.rs/2yqJh2I)

He faces a choice between two continuity candidates, Yellen and Governor Jerome Powell, and a clutch of outsiders, including Gary Cohn, currently his top economic advisor, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor.

Here are short profiles of the candidates:

Gary Cohn, 57, Director of the National Economic Council

Experience: Longtime Goldman Sachs employee and president and chief operating officer of the Wall Street bank from 2006 to 2017.

Education: Bachelor’s degree in business, American University

Policy positions: Cohn’s current job as director of the NEC has given him little reason to comment on monetary policy, but he has worried in the past that the Fed has been “constrained” by the actions of other central banks trying to keep their currencies weak.

In his own words: “If we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rates by (3 percent), the world would be a much better place.”

Pros to candidacy:

A practitioner’s understanding of financial markets at a time the Fed is attempting to unwind its bond portfolio bought after the 2008 financial crisis

The trust of the White House and many congressional Republicans given Cohn’s high-profile role in the Trump administration

Cons to candidacy:

No formal economics background at a time when the Fed leans ever more on econometric models to decipher mixed signals in inflation and employment data

A decades-long career at Goldman Sachs and a personal fortune worth at least $260 million, which could raise eyebrows when it comes to confirmation by the Senate, where members on both sides see the investment bank as a symbol of financial industry excess

Criticism of Trump in the wake of Charlottesville, Virginia, protests

Jerome Powell, 64, Federal Reserve Governor

Experience: Lawyer and investment banker; partner in private equity firm Carlyle Group from 1997-2005; Senior Treasury official under George H.W. Bush; Fed Governor since 2012 (appointed by President Obama)

Education: Bachelor’s degree in politics, Princeton University; Law degree from Georgetown University

Policy positions: Powell has never dissented while at the Fed, and in line with Yellen supports slowly raising interest rates as long as the economy continues growing and inflation is expected to rise. He advocates easing some aspects of the Dodd-Frank regulations and has discussed ways to revise the Volcker Rule.

In his own words: “The Committee has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends ... I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates.”

Pros to candidacy:

An uncontroversial pick for the position, could be the compromise who both replaces Yellen and provides continuity

Only Republican currently on the Board of Governors, has already helped guide the economy in its recovery and would likely get bipartisan support in Congress

Familiarity with markets and financial regulation may be considered a plus

Cons to candidacy:

As a current Fed member identified with the more centrist wing of the Republican Party, may not provide enough of a change if Trump decides to replace Yellen

Expertise is less in formal economics and more in markets and financial regulation, which may seem too much of an overlap with the new vice chair for supervision, Randal Quarles

John Taylor, 70, Senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution

Experience: Undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs in the George W. Bush administration from 2001 to 2005; member of Council of Economic Advisers under presidents Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush

Education: PhD in economics, Stanford University

Policy positions: Developer of the eponymous “Taylor Rule” for setting interest rates, Taylor feels the Fed should transition to a rules-based policy in order to make its decision-making “predictable-transparent-accountable.”

In his own words: “It is very important to have a basic understanding of the monetary policy strategy. The FOMC should be required to adopt and explain its monetary strategy, and then compare that strategy with monetary policy rules that are out there in a transparent way.”

Pros to candidacy:

A trained economist whose elegantly simple research in the 1990s transformed the debate over how central banks set rates

Support among key Capitol Hill Republicans who feel the Fed has too much discretion

Well known in central banking circles, even if his ideas are not universally supported

Cons to candidacy:

A long-term member of the central banking and academic cliques Trump may want to disrupt

Advocacy of rule-based policy may land with a thud in an institution that thrives on consensus and judgment

Break with Yellen and current policy framework could disrupt markets if Taylor insists on broad reform

Kevin Warsh, 47, Visiting Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution

Experience: Fed governor from 2006 to 2011; economic adviser to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006; M&A lawyer at Morgan Stanley for seven years

Education: Bachelor’s degree in public policy, Stanford University; Law degree from Harvard University

Policy positions: Warsh feels the Fed should not try to fine-tune the economy and argues policymakers have too much discretion. He feels the Fed should aim for inflation between 1 and 2 percent, effectively lowering its inflation target.

In his own words: “We should not accept the Fed’s newfound conviction that a very low neutral equilibrium real short-term interest rate (r*) is a fixed feature of future monetary policy ... The central bank and the academic community should engage in a fundamental rethinking of the Fed’s strategy, tools, governance, and communications.”

Pros to candidacy:

Former banker and for several years former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s right-hand man on financial markets, has a familiarity with Wall Street

Wife Jane Lauder Warsh is a daughter of cosmetics magnate Ron Lauder, a longtime friend of Trump

Served on the president’s economic advisory council before it disbanded

Cons to candidacy:

May be seen as too hawkish by a president who calls himself a “low interest rate person”

Not an academic economist like Yellen or Bernanke but has still maintained U.S. monetary policy needs a full makeover

Worried about inflation even as the 2008 financial crisis hit, and quit the Fed over its second round of bond-buying, a possible black mark against his judgment given the success of the “quantitative easing” program

Even while quitting over Fed bond buying, never dissented on FOMC decisions

Janet Yellen, 71, Federal Reserve Chair

Experience: Also served as a Fed governor, President of the San Francisco Fed, and the Fed’s vice chair from 2010 to 2014

Education: PhD in economics, Yale University

Policy positions: Yellen steered the Fed towards “gradual” rate increases and a slow reduction of its balance sheet, dependent on evidence of a continued economic recovery. She argues that post-crisis financial regulation has made the economy more stable without sacrificing growth.

In her own words: “My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market ... or even the fundamental forces driving inflation ... How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments.”

Pros to candidacy:

After a career in the Fed system and four years as its head, has earned the trust of markets and shown she can shift policy without major disruption

A growing economy, low unemployment, and strong stock markets make the case for continuity, while Trump has said publicly he feels she is doing a good job

Cons to candidacy:

Could be seen as a Democratic holdover by a President who may want to put his own stamp on the Fed

Feels the core regulations approved after the financial crisis should remain intact, a possible friction with the administration’s deregulatory bent

(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines Inc (IBM.N) surged 9 percent on Wednesday after it beat expectations on revenue and gave an outlook that hinted one of the world’s first big computing names was back on a growth track after six years in retreat.

There was no initial sign of changes to major brokerage ratings and most analysts shied away from calling a complete turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

But both Citi and Barclays raised their price targets for the stock, helping it towards its biggest daily percentage gain since 2009 -- a stark contrast with a nearly 12 percent fall so far this year.

The rise in the share price, last at $159.79, added $12.6 billion to the company’s market value and accounted for nearly 90 of the 105 point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday.

“After a difficult first half, IBM turned in a solid quarter last night and we continue to believe the company will emerge from this transition a much stronger IT organization,” Drexel Hamilton Brian White wrote in a client note.

He has a “buy” rating on the stock and a $200 price target.

Another analyst, Jefferies John DiFucci, argued that while IBM has struggled more than peers such as Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to adjust to a changing market, the quarterly performance of its software business was noteworthy.

He warned against reading across from the firm’s results to others in the sector.

“IBM has historically served as an indicator of overall software industry health, and as the world’s 3rd largest software vendor, its results are relevant,” he said.

“But we caution against direct read-throughs to other companies in recent times due to company-specific and secular challenges IBM has faced.”

Revenue at the company, one of the world’s original PC producers but now a broad-based producer, integrator and software maker, has fallen for 22 straight quarters.

Weak demand from customers had left its legacy hardware and software businesses stagnating.

The results showed revenue from IBM’s cloud, cybersecurity and data analytics business rose 11 percent to $8.8 billion in the quarter, accounting for about 46 percent of total revenue.

The company’s software revenue also grew for the first time after 13 consecutive quarters of declines.

“We were pleased to see the quality of IBM’s earnings improve, with IP income and taxes being less of a driver of upside than in prior quarters,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note.

But she added: “We see the business as secularly challenged due to its high exposure to a legacy business model, and see continued margin pressure over the long-term as IBM’s business is pressured by competition from lower-cost offerings and the cloud.”

Out of 25 analysts covering the stock, only 6 have a “buy” or higher rating, 15 are on “hold”, and 4 have a “sell” or lower. They have a median price target of $154.50.

The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States.","With the fate of the Iran nuclear deal at stake, Donald Trump has until October 15 to tell Congress if he believes Tehran is complying with the seven-nation agreement. Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

When coming into land from Miami on Monday morning, the A330 jet flew low across the runway, then pulled up and banked sharply to the left before landing on its second approach.

Pilots are trained in such “go-around” procedures for aborted landings, but the manoeuvre was unusual and the German aviation authorities are investigating.

“In aviation, safety always comes first. We are taking the incident very seriously,” an Air Berlin spokesman said.

The Air Berlin pilot had requested permission from the tower to make a left turn should a go-around be necessary.

“We wanted to make a mark, a dignified and emotional goodbye,” the Air Berlin pilot was quoted as saying by German broadcaster ZDF. His identity was not given.

Another pilot for a different carrier told Reuters that a go-around should be performed only for operational or safety reasons. “Electing to do one if it is known not to be required adds an unnecessary risk,” he said.

Several videos of the incident can be viewed online. In one, control tower staff can be heard exclaiming as the plane flies past, with one person saying: “We are all in awe.”

As the Senate opened debate on a fiscal year 2018 budget, Senator Rand Paul objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs.

“I will not vote for the budget unless it keeps within the spending caps,” the Republican senator told reporters. In a conversation with Trump earlier on Tuesday, Paul said he told the Republican president: “I‘m all in. I want to be supportive. I‘m a ‘yes’ vote. But we have to obey our own rules.”

Senate Republican aides denied that the budget resolution exceeds federal spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Paul said the excess spending was for overseas military operations, which aides said are not subject to caps.

The budget resolution already had a narrow path to passage in the Senate, where Democrats oppose the measures and Republicans have only a 52-48 majority. A “no” vote from Paul appeared to put the budget a single vote from failure, threatening to upend Trump’s drive for tax reform.

Another fiscal hawk, Senator Ted Cruz, has refused to disclose whether he would support the measure.

However, the Republican odds of passing a budget resolution improved unexpectedly when Senator Thad Cochran returned to the Senate despite an illness and said in a statement that he looked forward to “taking part in the debate on the budget and tax cuts.” A day earlier, Cochran’s office had said he would not be available this week.

With Cochran in the Senate, Republicans can pass the measure even if they lose two votes.

The budget resolution is essential to Trump’s tax reform strategy because it would unlock a legislative tool known as reconciliation, which would allow Senate Republicans to pass a tax bill with a simple majority. Without it, a partisan tax bill would need 60 votes in the 100-member Senate and would almost certainly fail.

The Republican effort had gained momentum on Monday when two other potential Senate Republican “no” votes - Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski - indicated they were leaning toward “yes.” Senator John McCain also said he would support the budget resolution.

After failing to overturn Obamacare earlier this year, Republicans fear they will face a backlash from constituents in next year’s congressional midterm elections if they are unable to pass legislation to cut taxes for businesses and individuals.

Trump and top Republicans have proposed a plan to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years as part of a reform package that they say will boost economic growth and provide more jobs and higher wages.

Democrats, who criticize the Republican plan as a giveaway to the wealthy, will likely propose numerous amendments to the budget plan to prevent tax cuts for the rich and require legislation that would not expand the federal deficit.

“We’re talking about a major political party now working night and day on behalf of the top 0.1 percent,” Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told Reuters on Tuesday.

Hamilton currently enjoys a hefty 59-point advantage, with 100 still to be won. He must score 16 more than his German rival on Sunday to prevent the title battle continuing to Mexico City’s Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on the following weekend.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The head of Kenya’s election commission said on Wednesday he could not guarantee next week’s presidential election will be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues.

Wafula Chebukati’s statement came hours after another commission member resigned and left the country, saying she and her staff had been repeatedly threatened.

“Ironically, the very people, political leaders, who are supposed to build the nation have become the greatest threat to the peace and stability of the nation,” Chebukati told journalists.

The Oct. 26 poll is the re-run of an election that took place in August, where incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory was nullified on procedural grounds.

But the run-up to the new poll has been fraught, particularly since Kenyatta’s main challenger, opposition leader Raila Odinga, pulled out, alleging a failure to improve the oversight of the election.

Odinga has called nearly daily protests against the poll and the election commission, pushing East Africa’s largest economy - a stable Western ally in a chaotic region - deeper into turmoil.

Kenyatta on Wednesday restated his commitment to the poll, but Odinga called for a mass protest on election day - raising the prospect of confrontations between protesters and voters.

“Demonstrations will continue. October 26 will be the biggest demonstration of them all,” Odinga told a crowd of several thousand cheering supporters in Nairobi.

Commission head Chebukati said technical preparations for the new poll were on course, but his attempts to make “critical changes”, notably to staff, had been defeated by a majority of commissioners. He said he been pressured to resign, without giving further details.

“Under such conditions, it is difficult to guarantee a free fair and credible election,” Chebukati said. “We cannot move forward with a divided commission.”

Election staff attending training sessions in some opposition strongholds were attacked this week, police said.

A senior Western diplomat in Nairobi condemned the attacks, saying of Odinga: “There is growing frustration among Western diplomats that a man who stood for democracy ... is essentially in charge of a movement trying to sabotage an election.”

“There is thuggery going on ... People who incite violence will be held accountable,” the diplomat told Reuters.

Roselyn Akombe, another of the board’s eight members, flew to New York and issued a statement dated Tuesday, saying “the commission has become a party to the current crisis” and was “under siege”.

She said commissioners were serving partisan interests, and legal advice was being skewed for political reasons. Akombe urged Kenyans to remember the violence that followed a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed. She told BBC radio she fled after receiving threats from both sides.

A week before the August poll, the election commission’s head of IT was found tortured and murdered in Nairobi, raising fears of a possible hack of the commission’s computer systems.

At least 37 people have died in violence since the August vote, including four killed in confrontations between police and protesters in the past week.

The uncertainty over the vote has affected financial markets: the central bank sold dollars in the foreign exchange market after the Kenyan shilling weakened on news of Akombe’s resignation. [nL8N1MT1F5]

Central bank governor Patrick Njoroge told Reuters on Thursday that the government was revising its 2017 economic growth forecast downwards amid high political uncertainty. [L8N1MT4FJ] Last month, Kenya cut its growth forecast to 5.5 percent from 5.9 percent.

PROTESTS AND POLITICS

Kenyan law requires that the new election be held within 60 days of the Sept. 1 decision by the Supreme Court to cancel the results of the original vote, but Odinga says his withdrawal should trigger a new, 90-day election cycle.

In withdrawing his candidacy last week, Odinga said the election board had not carried out reforms, including firing of key officials who he blames for mistakes in the Aug. 8 vote.

But Kenyatta said in a televised speech on Wednesday: “We walk towards the declared date of the 26th of October both as a God-fearing leadership and government.”

The ruling party has used its parliamentary majority to pass amendments to the electoral law curtailing the grounds on which the Supreme Court can nullify an election. Kenyatta has not yet signed the amendments after heavy international criticism.

The election board says it has conducted some reforms and the vote will go ahead with Odinga on the ballot.

This week, police raided homes belonging to wealthy opposition financier Jimi Wanjigi and said they had found a cache of weapons. Wanjigi said in an emotional interview that the firearms were licensed and that he was being persecuted.

On Tuesday, Deputy President William Ruto said Odinga had pulled out of the race to avoid a “humiliating defeat”.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A second U.S. federal judge has blocked parts of President Donald Trump’s latest travel ban on people entering the United States from eight countries, dealing another legal blow to the administration’s third bid to impose travel restrictions.

U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, in a ruling issued overnight, said the policy as applied to six majority-Muslim countries likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on religious discrimination. He also ruled the ban ran afoul of immigration law.

Trump’s ban would have taken effect on Wednesday but was blocked on Tuesday by a U.S. federal judge in Hawaii in a separate challenge.

Together, the pair of rulings set up a high-stakes battle over the president’s executive authority that is expected to ultimately wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump’s latest order targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. Neither of the court rulings lifts the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela.

In the Maryland ruling, Chuang questioned the government’s argument that the restrictions are needed until the affected countries provide more information on travelers to the United States.

He cited various statements made by Trump, including his 2015 call for a “total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States.”

Chuang wrote that the president’s public statements “not only fail to advance, but instead undermine, the position that the primary purpose of the travel ban now derives from the need to address information sharing deficiencies.”

The latest ban, announced last month, was the third version of a policy that targeted Muslim-majority countries but had been restricted by the courts. The Maryland case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project.

“Like the two versions before it, President Trump’s latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core. And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts,” said ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu said Hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that the policy violated federal immigration law. The White House called the ruling flawed and said it would appeal.

Unlike the Hawaii ruling, the Maryland decision would lift the restrictions only for people with family connections to the United States.

SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - A economia do Brasil contraiu mais do que o esperado em agosto, resultado mais fraco em cinco meses e interrompendo dois meses de alta, mas ainda insuficiente para frear o processo de recuperação gradual da atividade.

O Índice de Atividade Econômica do BC (IBC-Br), espécie de sinalizador do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), caiu 0,38 por cento em agosto sobre julho, em dado dessazonalizado. Pesquisa da Reuters com analistas mostrou que a expectativa era de contração de 0,15 por cento.

“Esse resultado não altera nossa expectativa de retomada gradual da atividade econômica. Esperamos ainda uma aceleração da atividade econômica no quarto trimestre, consistente com nossa projeção de uma expansão de 0,9 por cento do PIB neste ano”, informou o banco Bradesco em nota.

O resultado negativo foi o maior desde março, quando o IBC-Br teve contração de 0,40 por cento, e veio após o país ter iniciado o terceiro trimestre com crescimento mensal de 0,36 por cento em julho, em dado revisado pelo BC de alta de 0,41 por cento divulgada inicialmente.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Thousands of Somalis demonstrated on Wednesday against those behind bombings that killed more than 300 people, defying police who opened fire to keep them away from the site where their loved-ones were killed.

The twin blasts in the heart of Mogadishu on Saturday also injured more than 400 in what were the country’s deadliest truck bombings.

Police initially opened fire to prevent people from accessing the rubble-strewn scene of the attack, injuring at least two people, the emergency response service said. But, overwhelmed by the number of people, they eventually let thousands of protesters gather at the site.

Residents said they had never seen such a big protest in the city.

“We are demonstrating against the terrorists that massacred our people. We entered the road by force,” said Halima Abdullahi, a mother who lost six of her relatives in the attacks.

The Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which began an insurgency in 2007, has not claimed responsibility, but the method and type of attack - a large truck bomb - is increasingly used by the al Qaeda-linked organization.

Mohamed Ali, a police captain at the scene, said it was fine for protesters to access the site to express their grief.

“For some who could not see their relatives alive or dead, the only chance they have is to at least see the spot where their beloved were killed,” he told Reuters.

Later President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed addressed demonstrators at a football field in the city and called on Somalis to join the national army.

“Take your guns and let’s liberate our country. Come forward for recruitment (into) government forces in order to fight and eliminate al Shabaab,” he said.

The government buried at least 160 of those killed because they could not be identified after the blast.

Masked security officers kept an eye on the protest on foot and on motorbikes. Some protesters sat on police trucks waving sticks and chanting: “We do not want al Shabaab”.

The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have been steadily losing territory. But they retain the capacity to mount large bomb attacks.

Over the past three years, the number of civilians killed by insurgent bombings has steadily climbed as al Shabaab increases the size of its bombs.

In the central town of Dusamareb, residents also marched for several hours to protest against the bombings in Mogadishu and clerics called for the war on the militants to be stepped up.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Aamin Ambulances, said one pregnant demonstrator was evacuated from the Mogadishu protest after she developed complications.

Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall about 1.3 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million.

The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing.

A Ford spokeswoman said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones.

Ford said the cost of the new recall would be reflected in its fourth-quarter results. Ford said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85‍​ per share.

The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving.

Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.

Ford previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in August 2016.

Several members of May’s party are expected to side with the opposition Labour Party during a symbolic debate in parliament and demand a halt to the implementation of a new welfare payment system, which has been dogged by design problems.

May leads a minority government, propped up by a small Northern Irish party, faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the European Union - which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation.

Wednesday’s debate, although it cannot force the government to act, could show how hard that will be if members of her own party are willing to speak out against her government.

Earlier this month, Conservative lawmaker Heidi Allen and 13 others - enough to defeat May with the support of opposition parties - wrote to the government calling for the welfare reform to be dropped.

“Today’s a big day. It feels like a bit of a crescendo,” Allen told the government’s welfare minister, David Gauke, at a parliamentary committee meeting before the debate. She then raised a string of concerns about the policy.

Allen and other potential rebels were reported to have met May on Tuesday to try to broker a compromise. The government could head off a public rebellion by allowing the Labour motion to pass without a formal vote.

Labour, which wants to topple May’s government and take control of the troubled Brexit process, has urged Conservative MPs to rebel.

“The social security system is meant to protect people from debt and arrears, not exacerbate their situation,” said Labour lawmaker Debbie Abrahams. “We must stand together to make our voices heard ... I urge Conservative MPs (members of parliament) to vote with their conscience and support our motion.”

The welfare reform, known as “Universal Credit”, is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one.

The policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under May’s predecessor David Cameron, but the expansion of the programme to more people has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens.

The government is pressing ahead with the latest phase of the programme despite concerns voiced by MPs from all parties that claimants must wait six weeks for payment. The government says they have taken measures to stop this happening.",MPs to vent anger at May's fragile government over welfare reform,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics/mps-to-vent-anger-at-mays-fragile-government-over-welfare-reform-idUKKBN1CN1FF?il=0

MONROVIA (Reuters) - George Weah has been here before: on the goal line of the Liberian presidency, one run-off vote from victory. Unlike in 2005, however, his support is much wider and many expect him at last to succeed.

The 1995 European soccer player of the year won 39 percent of votes in first round presidential polls last week, with 95 percent of votes counted. The final result is due on Wednesday.

That was 10 percentage points more than closest rival Vice President Joseph Boakai, and a better score than he had in earlier contests, but short of the 50 percent needed to win.

A run-off between Weah and Boakai will be held in November.

The result shows how support has grown steadily for the former AC Milan striker, who lit up television screens in Liberia in the 1990s with his mazy runs, briefly distracting fans from a 1989-2003 civil war that killed tens of thousands.

Now “King George”, as his supporters call him, has to persuade the majority that he can run a country as well as he kicks a ball.

His rhetoric has been light on policy so far. In an interview on Oct 8 he spoke vaguely about a need for better roads.

“We will seek a government of inclusion where everyone can work together and make our country a better one for all of us,” he told Reuters.

Weah grew up in Clara Town slum in the capital Monrovia, playing football there and in Cameroon, where manager Arsene Wenger spotted him and took him to Monaco. He went on to play for Milan and Paris St Germain, and later in his career for Chelsea, Manchester City and Marseille.

He became the first non-European to win the Ballon d‘Or in 1995, the same year he picked up the African and world player of the year awards.

His rags-to-riches story has inspired supporters from similarly lowly backgrounds.

“Weah is grass roots, a son of the soil - he is a star, but he has the country at heart,” said Oliver Myers, an unemployed 39-year-old from the Rehab neighborhood outside Monrovia.

Others are wary of his lack of political experience and education, and question his ability to govern a country that remains 12th from bottom of the U.N. Human Development Index.

“Weah’s populism and inability to articulate a coherent platform ... are deeply concerning,” said Liberian political analyst Robtel Neajai Pailey in a recent opinion piece for Liberian website The Bush Chicken.

“Success at football does not translate into success in the presidency of a traumatized, poorly managed, post-war nation.”

“THERE FOR US”

Doubts over Weah’s experience could still sink his ambitions in next month’s run-off, as in 2005, when he won the first round but lost the second to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who went on to rule for 12 years.

Weah refused to take part in televised debates attended by most other major candidates, and his choice of running mate Jewel Howard-Taylor - ex-wife of Charles Taylor, the former president and warlord serving 50 years in Britain for war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone - has raised eyebrows.

Johnson Sirleaf was credited with shoring up peace after the civil war, but criticized for failing to tackle elite graft and doing little to lift most Liberians out of poverty.

Development has been hindered by an Ebola outbreak and a drop in the price of iron ore. Poor roads still leave most of rural Liberia stranded during the rainy season, often without electricity. In Monrovia, where derelict buildings line the main highways, most live on pitted dirt streets with little access to clean water.

Boakai, 72, Sirleaf’s deputy for 12 years, has struggled to separate himself from her during his campaign, despite promoting his humble beginnings.

As Weah gained popularity, he was elected to the Liberian senate in 2014, defeating the president’s son Robert Sirleaf.

He still plays football every Sunday in Monrovia.

“While people have reservations about his lack of education, he is seen as the candidate for change,” a diplomat told Reuters on Monday.

“It will take a lot for Boakai to turn this one around.”

Thomas Kojo, who played with Weah on the Liberia national team, thinks his former teammate’s passion for his country will take him far.

“The heart George has for Liberia is unbelievable,” Kojo said in an interview outside Weah’s compound in Rehab on Monday. “He made sure the national team was always trying to bring (home) some pride.”

Weah paid for the national team’s kit when the Football Association couldn’t afford it during the war, and gave players up to $600 spending money and similar bonuses if the team won, Kojo said. He once chartered a flight for the team when they were stranded in Ivory Coast without a flight to a game.

“The football team was the only good image to come from Liberia when all people saw was the killing,” Kojo said.

“He made sure he was there for us.”",Ex-soccer star 'King George' nears goal of Liberia presidency,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CN0PM-OZATP

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran’s military chief warned Israel against breaching Syrian airspace and territory on a visit to Damascus on Wednesday, raising tensions with Israel as it voices deep concern over Tehran’s influence in Syria.

General Mohammad Baqeri pledged to increase cooperation with Syria’s military to fight Israel and insurgents, Iranian and Syrian state media said.

Iranian forces and Iran-backed Shi‘ite militias, including Hezbollah, have provided critical military support to Damascus, helping it regain swathes of Syria from rebels and militants.

“It’s not acceptable for the Zionist regime to violate the land and airspace of Syria anytime it wants,” Baqeri said at a news conference with his Syrian counterpart.

“We are in Damascus to assert and cooperate to confront our common enemies, the Zionists and terrorists,” he said, a reference to Israel and Sunni Muslim jihadists including Islamic State.

“We drew up the broad lines for this cooperation,” Syrian state media cited the Iranian military chief of staff as saying.

Iran’s expanding clout during Syria’s more than six-year war has raised alarm in Israel, which has said it would act against any threat from its regional arch-enemy Tehran.

Israel’s air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Hezbollah nearly 100 times during the war.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran was strengthening its foothold in Syria and that Israel would “do whatever it takes” to protect its security.

Tensions have risen this year between Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Israel, which have avoided a major conflict since 2006.

This week, the Israeli military said it attacked a Syrian anti-aircraft battery that had fired at its planes over Lebanon. But the Syrian army said it hit an Israeli warplane after it breached its airspace at the Syria-Lebanon border.

“Our job is to prevent war, and you do that through deterrence. What we saw in Syria (on Monday) fell within this framework,” the Israeli defence minister told Israel Radio on Wednesday before the Iranian military chief’s comments.

“We will do whatever is necessary for (our) security,” Avigdor Lieberman added. “We will not change our operating procedures because of shooting or a threat of this type or another.”","From Damascus, Iran vows to confront Israel",https://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-iran/from-damascus-iran-vows-to-confront-israel-idINKBN1CN12W

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein has resigned from the board of The Weinstein Company, it said on Tuesday, as he faces allegations that he sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women over three decades in the film business.

In a statement, the board said it also ratified its Oct. 8 decision to fire Weinstein as chief executive of the award-winning movie and television company he co-founded with his brother.

A source close to Weinstein confirmed that he had resigned from the board and had no further comment. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Also on Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp’s Lexus unit said it was evaluating its partnership with the Weinstein Co. Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand, is a sponsor of reality TV show “Project Runway,” which Weinstein Co produces.

“Lexus does not condone any acts of sexual harassment, assault or discrimination. In light of recent allegations involving Harvey Weinstein, we are currently evaluating our partnership with The Weinstein Company, but have nothing to announce at this time,” Lexus said in a statement.

A&E Television Networks, which airs “Project Runway” on its Lifetime cable channel, is also exploring its options for the show, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.

Weinstein’s executive producer credit and the Weinstein Co logo were removed from “Project Runway” last week.

A&E wants to be respectful of women who say they were harmed by Weinstein, the source said, and also is concerned about the livelihood of more than 200 cast and crew members who work on the series.

Weinstein Co is trying to chart a future without Weinstein, the aggressive dealmaker with a knack for managing Hollywood talent, money and egos. On Monday, it said it was in talks to sell the bulk of its assets to private equity firm Colony Capital.

One of Hollywood’s most influential forces since launching in October 2005, Weinstein Co has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.” Its television unit produces the long-running reality series “Project Runway.”

Harvey Weinstein is credited with conceiving the strategy that scored dozens of Oscar awards for the company’s films.

Hollywood trade publication Variety on Tuesday reported a separate harassment allegation against Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s younger brother and co-founder of Weinstein Co.

Bert Fields, an attorney for Bob Weinstein, said in a statement that the story was “false and misleading.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street hit new records on strong earnings and the dollar extended a winning streak on Wednesday, boosted by rising Treasury yields as investors focused on monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury yields hit years-long highs and the difference in yield between U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasuries fell to the lowest since November 2007 as expectations for tighter global monetary policy pushed investors to sell shorter-dated Treasuries.

“The general tone from Fed speakers this week has been more on the hawkish side,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. “That and the global removal of accommodation is something markets have noticed.”

Rajappa said U.S. yields were rising in concert with European government bonds on expectations the European Central Bank, could signal a rollback of monetary stimulus on Thursday.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was boosted by strong earnings from heavyweight International Business Machines (IBM.N), which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average open above 23,000 for the first time.

“We’re in a sweet spot where the economy is growing not too strong and not too weak, the Fed’s tightening but not too rapidly, and earnings continue to expand. All the news is positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 121.94 points, or 0.53 percent, to 23,119.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.2 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,560.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.06 points, or 0 percent, to 6,623.72.

Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.3447 percent, from 2.298 percent late on Tuesday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 32/32 in price to yield 2.8531 percent, from 2.803 percent late on Tuesday.

The dollar rose for a fifth straight day, boosted by soaring Treasury yields.

The dollar index .DXY rose 0.09 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.05 percent to $1.1772.

In commodity markets, Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday and U.S. crude declined, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs boosted inventories of gasoline and diesel.

U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.25 percent to $51.75 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.85, down 0.05 percent on the day.

Gold fell for a third straight session on pressure from a firmer dollar amid speculation that the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve could be a policy hawk. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.3 percent to $1,280.53 an ounce.

Rajoy issued his appeal in the national parliament, where he sought to win more political support for taking direct control of Catalonia on Thursday if the rebel regional government sticks to a plan to break away.

The move would need only a vote in Spain’s upper house, where Rajoy’s People’s Party holds an absolute majority.

It would be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that direct rule has been imposed.

A constitutional provision allows the central government to impose the law by giving orders to all branches of the regional authorities. Precisely how that would work in practical matters such as commanding the police force is untested.

Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers.

Many Spaniards fear the unprecedented step could lead to social unrest. The crisis has prompted hundreds of Catalan firms to move their headquarters, led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts and weighed on the euro.

In the latest grim prediction, Spain’s independent budget watchdog warned on Wednesday that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off the economy next year, reducing expected growth by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points.

Puigdemont has already defied Madrid once this week, reiterating on Monday an ambiguous independence declaration he made last week and immediately suspended.

“I ask Puigdemont to act sensibly, in a balanced way, to put the interests of all citizens first,” Rajoy said on Wednesday, mentioning both residents of the autonomous region, which produces a fifth of Spain’s wealth and has its own language and culture, and the rest of the country.

Thursday’s deadline is Puigdemont’s last chance to abandon an independence declaration which Madrid has rejected as illegal, and defuse Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

“It’s not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not we can talk here,” Rajoy said in parliament.

The row has rattled financial markets and sent companies scurrying to relocate on safer ground. Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, was considering moving its top management to Madrid.

Almost 700 companies pulled out of the northeastern region between Oct. 2 - the day after a referendum on independence which Madrid branded illegal - and Oct. 16, according to Spain’s companies registry.

Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centered on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday.

The region’s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter “if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months”, Exceltur said in a statement.

THREAT OF DIRECT RULE

Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that exactly what direct rule would look like is not clear, adding the government would work on it.

La Vanguardia said Puigdemont, a 54-year-old former journalist, was mulling declaring independence and calling so-called constituent elections for the newly-declared republic.

But Catalan foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told a news conference in Brussels: “Elections are not on the table now.”

As the threat of direct rule neared, the Catalan government took a combative tone.

“Giving in forms no part of this government’s scenarios,” spokesman Jordi Turull said on Tuesday. “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”

Tempers have flared since the jailing on Monday of two separatist leaders pending an investigation for alleged sedition.

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona’s Diagonal Avenue on Tuesday to call for their release, whistling and shouting “freedom” and “out with the occupying forces”.

Puigdemont said: “Sadly, we have political prisoners again,” referring to the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who suppressed Catalan culture and language until his death in 1975.",Spain asks Catalan leader to 'act sensibly' as direct rule deadline nears,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-rajoy/spain-asks-catalan-leader-to-act-sensibly-as-direct-rule-deadline-nears-idUKKBN1CN0VR?il=0

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Clinton also called on China to take a “more outfront role” in enforcing sanctions against North Korea aimed at curbing its missile and nuclear development.

“There is no need for us to be bellicose and aggressive (over North Korea),” Clinton told the World Knowledge Forum in the South Korean capital of Seoul, stressing the need for more pressure on North Korea and diplomacy to bring Pyongyang to talks.

Tension between Pyongyang and Washington has soared following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“Picking fights with Kim Jong Un puts a smile on his face,” Clinton said, without mentioning Trump by name.

Clinton also indirectly referred to Trump’s social media comments on North Korea, saying, “The insults on Twitter have benefited North Korea, I don’t think they’ve benefited the United States”.

The war of words has seen Trump call the North Korean leader “little rocket man” on a suicide mission, and vow to destroy the country if it threatens the United States or its allies. In turn, the North called Trump “mentally deranged” and a “mad dog”.

Talks between the adversaries have long been urged by China in particular, but Washington and its ally Japan have been reluctant while Pyongyang continues to pursue a goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile to hit the United States.

On Tuesday, Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said the United States did not rule out the eventual possibility of direct talks with North Korea.

The situation on the Korean peninsula was now touch-and-go point “and a nuclear war may break out any moment”, North Korea’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim In Ryong had told a U.N. General Assembly committee on Monday.

In Seoul, the vice foreign minister said on Wednesday South Korea was considering levying its own sanctions on the North, although no decision has been made yet.

CHINA PRESSURE

Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said Washington’s allies have increasingly been expressing concern over the reliability of the United States, advising Washington to avoid becoming distracted with North Korean threats and be “as forcefully patient” as possible.

Regarding China’s role in reining in North Korea, Clinton said Beijing would be better off trying to “tighten and absolutely enforce sanctions” against North Korea.

North Korea’s relationship with its main ally and trading partner China have been strained by its rapid pursuit of weapons programs, with many of Pyongyang’s recent tests coinciding with major Chinese events.

There had been fears that North Korea would conduct another test to coincide with the start of China’s five-yearly party congress on Wednesday. Instead, Pyongyang sent Beijing a congratulatory message.

The central committee of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea said China had made “great progress in accomplishing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics” under the guidance of the Communist Party of China.

“We are greatly pleased over this,” the party central committee said in the message carried by the official KCNA news agency, adding that it “sincerely wished” the China congress “satisfactory success”.

Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention North Korea in his more than three-hour-long address at the opening of a key Communist Party Congress.

CAN‘T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS

Clinton said retaliatory actions by China over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea, which targeting the latter’s firms doing business in China, would be unnecessary had Beijing done a better job reining in the North.

China says the powerful radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system could be used to pierce its territory, and has taken aim at South Korea’s businesses. South Korea and the United States have repeatedly told China that THAAD aims only to defend against North Korea’s missile threats.

“The Chinese can’t have it both ways,” Clinton said. “They can’t do less than they could to tighten economic pressures on North Korea and same time discount the real threat South Korea and its citizens face.”","Hillary Clinton says U.S. threats of war with North Korea 'dangerous, short-sighted'",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-u-s-threats-of-war-with-north-korea-dangerous-short-sighted-idUSKBN1CN03S?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada has tapped Google parent Alphabet Inc to help plan a mixed-use development along Toronto’s Lake Ontario waterfront using cutting-edge digital technologies and urban design.

Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs unit, which is developing new technologies for use in “smart cities,” said it would invest $50 million in the initial planning and testing phase of the project, which will create a new neighborhood called Quayside.

“For the foreseeable future this will be the primary focus of what we do,” Dan Doctoroff, the chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, said in an interview.

One of the first projects Sidewalk Labs will take on is a sensor-based technology to manage crowds on a nearby street often filled with a potent mix of pedestrians, cyclists and motorized traffic, which Doctoroff said could be tested as early as the first quarter of 2018.

He said the company was also looking to integrate self-driving technology into the project over the longer term.

Doctoroff said the company had looked at more than 50 metropolitan areas in North America and sites in western Europe and Australia before settling on Toronto as the prime location for its future city test bed.

Google said it would move its Canadian headquarters and some 300 employees to the district once it is completed. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced the partnership with Google, said he hoped that Quayside would become “a thriving hub for innovation and a community for tens of thousands of people to live, work and play.”

It is Sidewalk Labs’ most ambitious project to date, which the company expects will house 5,000 people and host another 5,000 workers within three to four years.

The Google unit has previously worked with Qualcomm Inc and Civiq Smartscapes to retrofit New York City phone booths into digital billboards that serve as WiFi hotspots.

Intersection, the Sidewalk Labs subsidiary behind the effort, recently launched similar kiosks in London. Another division, Flow, has held talks with cities such as Columbus, Ohio, about providing software to evaluate transit programs.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s oil sands producers are stuck in a rut.

The nation’s oil firms are retrenching, with large producers planning little or no further expansion and some smaller projects struggling even to cover their operating costs.

As the era of large new projects comes to a close, many mid-sized producers - those with fewer assets and producing less than 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the oil sands - have shelved expansion plans, unable to earn back the high start-up costs with crude at around $50 per barrel. Larger Canadian producers, meanwhile, focus on projects that in the past were associated with smaller names.

The last three years have seen dozens of new projects mothballed and expansions put on hold, meaning millions of barrels of crude from the world’s third-largest reserves may never be extracted.

Where industry groups in 2014 expected Canada’s oil sands output to more than double to nearly 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, that forecast has been knocked down to 3.7 million bpd.

This follows a spell of consolidation that has seen foreign majors sell off more than $23 billion in Canadian assets in a year and turn to U.S. shale patches such as the Permian basin in Texas, which produce returns more quickly and where proximity to refiners means the barrels fetch a better price.

“We cannot compete with that huge sucking noise to the south that is called the Permian. Investment dollars are spiraling away down there,” Derek Evans, chief executive of small oil sands producer Pengrowth Energy (PGF.TO) told Reuters in an interview.

Permian production rose 21 percent in 12 months through July compared to a 9 percent increase in Alberta’s oil sands, according to Canadian and U.S. government data.

COSTLY STARTUP PHASE

Mid-sized producers are hurting the most, due to start-up costs that far exceed those in other major producing areas. Oil sands producers have slashed operating costs by a third since 2014, but building a new thermal project - in which steam is pumped as deep as one kilometer (1094 yards)underground to liquefy tar-like bitumen and bring it to the surface - requires U.S. crude benchmark at around $60 a barrel to break even, analysts estimate.

FILE PHOTO - Giant dump trucks haul raw tar sands at the Suncor tar sands mining operations near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada on September 17, 2014. REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo

The North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 has traded between $42 and $55 a barrel so far this year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts it will average $49.69 a barrel in 2017 and $50.57 a barrel next year.

There are around half a dozen thermal projects in the costly start-up phase, when engineers steadily increase steam pressure to bring a reservoir’s production up to full capacity.

One of those is Athabasca Oil Corp’s (ATH.TO) Hangingstone project. It was originally conceived as a 80,000 bpd project, but instead will bring output to only 12,000 bpd from the current 9,000 bpd. The project can break even with U.S. crude prices of at least $53 a barrel, meaning right now Athabasca keeps losing money on Hangingstone production. Size is crucial in the oil sands; the more bitumen a company can squeeze out of a plant, the lower fixed costs per barrel will be.

“(Athabasca) was a company built when oil was $100 a barrel. In those days we were going to find funding for joint ventures and build greenfield projects to a massive size. The reality is the world changed,” chief executive Rob Broen told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A Suncor refinery is seen in Sherwood Park, near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada November 13, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo

Quarterly filings show why smaller players are struggling. Transportation and marketing costs at Hangingstone, along with the cost of natural gas used to produce steam to extract oil, and other operating costs are much higher compared with Cenovus Energy’s (CVE.TO) Christina Lake project, one of the highest-quality and biggest bitumen reservoirs in the oil sands.

Pengrowth’s development plans are on hold as well, Evans said, because the company needs U.S. crude to stay at $55 for a sustained period to justify investment in its 14,000 bpd Lindbergh thermal project, at one point intended to grow as large as 40,000 bpd.

THE BIG GO SMALL

Large producers have pulled back in response to lower global prices as well. For example, Suncor Energy’s (SU.TO) 194,000 bpd Fort Hills mine, due to start producing oil by the end of this year, is the company’s last megaproject.

Canadian Natural (CNQ.TO) restarted construction on its 40,000 bpd Kirby North project last November, one of a handful of smaller projects to start producing in 2019.

Other companies like MEG Energy (MEG.TO) are planning expansions at existing sites in 20,000 bpd “modules” rather than starting large new projects from scratch. But even such more modest investments are out of reach for smaller companies like Athabasca and Pengrowth.

“It’s very hard (for a small company) to drag itself out of the financing black hole it would have to get in to build a project to start with,” said Nick Lupick, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital. “A large company can take that on their balance sheet without having to leverage too highly.”","Canada's oil sands survive, but can't thrive in a $50 oil world",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CN0FD-OCATP

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Die Hängepartie um die Zukunft Kataloniens hat zum Wochenanfang die Kauflaune der europäischen Aktienanleger gedämpft.

Der Dax kehrte zwar über die vorige Woche erstmals geknackte 13.000er Marke zurück und legte 0,3 Prozent auf 13.026 Zähler zu, blieb damit aber unter der am Freitag aufgestellten Bestmarke von 13.036 Punkten. Der EuroStoxx50 legte ebenfalls 0,3 Prozent auf 3613 Punkte zu. “Die Kuh in Katalonien ist noch nicht vom Eis”, sagte LBBW-Analyst Wolfgang Albrest. Daher schalteten die Anleger am Aktienmarkt einen Gang zurück. Für die Wall Street signalisierten die US-Futures eine zunächst kaum veränderte Eröffnung.

Der katalanische Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont wich auch am Montag einer klaren Aussage aus, ob er vergangene Woche die Unabhängigkeit seiner Region ausgerufen hat. Stattdessen forderte er die Regierung in Madrid erneut zum Dialog auf. Diese drohte daraufhin, die Region unter ihre Kontrolle zu nehmen, sollte Puigdemont nicht bis Donnerstag, 10.00 Uhr, die Unabhängigkeit widerrufen. Die Unsicherheit verprellte die Anleger in Madrid: Der Leitindex der Börse verlor 0,9 Prozent.

By Thursday, the California fires had killed at least 23 people and destroyed 3,500 homes or businesses. Those numbers are likely to increase once the fire is suppressed and officials can conduct more thorough searches.

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

BEIJING (Reuters) - In his baseball cap and baggy yellow t-shirt, the rap star Li Yijie - better known by his stage name “Pissy” - is an unlikely face of China’s strait-laced ruling Communist Party.

His group, Tianfu Shibian, has won fans and the support of the party’s youth league with songs like “Force of Red” and “This is China” that chime with President Xi Jinping’s nationalist vision of China and its place in the world.

Under Xi, set to begin a second five-year term at a key party congress next month, the once-hidebound Communist Party has sought to revitalise its role in society amid challenges to its traditional authority as the country gets richer, more mobile and more digitally connected.

The party’s modernising push also comes as a significant number of educated Chinese millennials, faced with a tough job market and high housing costs in big cities, have grown disillusioned about their career and life prospects.

The party’s effort extends increasingly to co-opting swathes of Chinese popular culture, such as Tianfu Shibian. At the same time, the government is cracking down on online content and entertainment that strays beyond the narrowing definitions of what is acceptable.

If the Party “sticks to the old ways, it will only be more and more rejected by young people,” said Li, 23, whose band’s name means “Tianfu Incident”. Tianfu refers to the region around Chengdu, the band’s home city in western Sichuan province.

“We need to stand up and say: Why can’t younger folks be more patriotic?” he said during an interview in Beijing.

“We need to step into this system,” he said. “If the post-1990 generations don’t enter the system, what is our country going to do?” said Li.

Beijing has the same idea.

It has latched onto other acts like TFBOYS, a wholesome boy band whose three members each have nearly 30 million followers on the popular microblog Weibo, to help spread the Party message. The band often appears at Youth League events.

“This kind of propaganda is a step forward that better suits the demands of its audience,” said Qiao Mu, a media researcher and former professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University.

“Ordinary people are now rejecting the old preaching ways of the People’s Daily newspaper and CCTV News,” he said, referring to the Party’s official newspaper and China’s state broadcaster.

On its Bilibili account - a video site popular with China’s post 1990s generation - the Communist Youth League has posted hundreds of videos this year interspersing patriotic raps with more traditional fare such as defence ministry briefings.

One such “guichu” – a fast-paced clip of repeated images, sounds and catchy music – calls on citizens to be on the lookout and report people they suspect are spies to the authorities.

‘FORCE OF RED’

Tianfu Shibian shot to prominence in 2016 voicing patriotic values in sometimes expletive-filled songs.

“Force of Red” attacked Tsai Ing-Wen, the president of Taiwan, an independently governed island that Beijing considers a renegade province.

“There’s only one China, HK, Taipei, they are my fellas,” ran the lyrics of the song in English, along with expletives aimed at Tsai and her government: “Far away from us you forget how to act. Even dogs know to come home with a thankful bark.”

The music video went viral, racking up more than 7 million views on the band’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo feed and catching the attention of the Communist Youth League, a training ground for elite cadres within the 90-million-strong Communist Party.

The group’s next outing - “This is China” - came with production support from a Youth League-backed music studio, though the band says there was no other financial backing.

The party connection deepened in September last year when Beijing sent the band to Woody Island, in a disputed area of the South China Sea, to film a music video rebuking an international tribunal ruling that rejected China’s claims in the area.

Li said the group now has ties across China’s propaganda related agencies, and frequently dines with officials to exchange ideas. In return they’ve cleaned up their act to fit with Beijing’s drive towards more wholesome content.

While their songs are unabashedly pro-China, Tianfu Shibian’s lyrics also touch on problems in contemporary China, including tainted food, corruption, and pollution.

“Critique with rationality has its place in our songs, but we despise those who keep complaining blindly,” Li told Reuters.

Not everyone is a fan.

A song by the band praising the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong was criticised online as glossing over China’s Cultural Revolution, a period of chaos and violence between 1966-1976 in which some historians estimate as many as 1.5 million people died.

Others online have dismissed the band as a propaganda machine, calling it “wumao” - roughly “50-cents” - a reference to those paid by the government to post patriotic comments online.

AT THE FRINGES

While countercultural or subversive art has long been at the fringes in China, it has all-but been extinguished in the Xi era, with censors banning not only politically incorrect material but also clamping down on negativity.

China’s most internationally recognised artist, Ai Weiwei, a fierce critic of Beijing, spent time under house arrest and finally left China in 2015. He had helped design Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest” stadium for the 2008 Olympics.

Erstwhile rock and roll rebels have cleaned up their acts to placate censors or been sidelined.

Zuoxiao Zuzhou - a music producer who was banned by the government from 2011-2014 for his connection to Ai Weiwei - is one who has chosen to toe the government line.

“With great difficulty,” Zuoxiao Zuzhou “has now established an image that is relatively acceptable to society,” his agent, Qin Baogui, told Reuters, declining an interview with the artist because of the sensitivity of the topic.

Cui Jian, whose 1986 “Nothing to My Name” became an unofficial anthem for students demonstrating during the deadly 1989 Tiananmen protests, pulled out of a show on Chinese state television in 2014 because he was told he would not be allowed to sing the song, his manager said at the time.

On the flip side, films and music that embrace the party have benefited from state support to tap China’s huge fan bases.

The overtly patriotic “Wolf Warrior 2” became China’s top grossing film after its July release, helped in part by strong state media support.

Last month, U.S. organizers aiming to bring Grammy Award artists to China said they would only “promote artists with a positive and healthy image.”

As for Li, he is currently working on a song in the run-up to next month’s Communist Party Congress, called “A Letter to President Xi Jinping.”

However, Li has not joined the party himself - though it’s some distance from youthful rebellion.

“It’s too troublesome and complicated to write an application letter,” he said.",Rap and the Party - China taps youth culture to hook millennial cadres,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-congress-entertainment-insight/rap-and-the-party-china-taps-youth-culture-to-hook-millennial-cadres-idUKKCN1C00G8

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The head of Kenya’s election commission said on Wednesday he could not guarantee next week’s presidential election will be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against his colleagues.

Wafula Chebukati’s statement came hours after another commission member resigned and left the country, saying she and her staff had been repeatedly threatened.

“Ironically, the very people, political leaders, who are supposed to build the nation have become the greatest threat to the peace and stability of the nation,” Chebukati told journalists.

The Oct. 26 poll is the re-run of an election that took place in August, where incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory was nullified on procedural grounds.

But the run-up to the new poll has been fraught, particularly since Kenyatta’s main challenger, opposition leader Raila Odinga, pulled out, alleging a failure to improve the oversight of the election.

Odinga has called nearly daily protests against the poll and the election commission, pushing East Africa’s largest economy - a stable Western ally in a chaotic region - deeper into turmoil.

Kenyatta on Wednesday restated his commitment to the poll, but Odinga called for a mass protest on election day - raising the prospect of confrontations between protesters and voters.

“Demonstrations will continue. October 26 will be the biggest demonstration of them all,” Odinga told a crowd of several thousand cheering supporters in Nairobi.

Commission head Chebukati said technical preparations for the new poll were on course, but his attempts to make “critical changes”, notably to staff, had been defeated by a majority of commissioners. He said he been pressured to resign, without giving further details.

“Under such conditions, it is difficult to guarantee a free fair and credible election,” Chebukati said. “We cannot move forward with a divided commission.”

Election staff attending training sessions in some opposition strongholds were attacked this week, police said.

A senior Western diplomat in Nairobi condemned the attacks, saying of Odinga: “There is growing frustration among Western diplomats that a man who stood for democracy ... is essentially in charge of a movement trying to sabotage an election.”

“There is thuggery going on ... People who incite violence will be held accountable,” the diplomat told Reuters.

“COMMISSION UNDER SIEGE”

Roselyn Akombe, another of the board’s eight members, flew to New York and issued a statement dated Tuesday, saying “the commission has become a party to the current crisis” and was “under siege”.

She said commissioners were serving partisan interests, and legal advice was being skewed for political reasons. Akombe urged Kenyans to remember the violence that followed a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1,200 people were killed. She told BBC radio she fled after receiving threats from both sides.

A week before the August poll, the election commission’s head of IT was found tortured and murdered in Nairobi, raising fears of a possible hack of the commission’s computer systems.

At least 37 people have died in violence since the August vote, including four killed in confrontations between police and protesters in the past week.

The uncertainty over the vote has affected financial markets: the central bank sold dollars in the foreign exchange market after the Kenyan shilling weakened on news of Akombe’s resignation. [nL8N1MT1F5]

Kenyan law requires that the new election be held within 60 days of the Sept. 1 decision by the Supreme Court to cancel the results of the original vote, but Odinga says his withdrawal should trigger a new, 90-day election cycle.

In withdrawing his candidacy last week, Odinga said the election board had not carried out reforms, including firing of key officials who he blames for mistakes in the Aug. 8 vote.

But Kenyatta said in a televised speech on Wednesday: “We walk towards the declared date of the 26th of October both as a God-fearing leadership and government.”

The ruling party has used its parliamentary majority to pass amendments to the electoral law curtailing the grounds on which the Supreme Court can nullify an election. Kenyatta has not yet signed the amendments after heavy international criticism.

The election board says it has conducted some reforms and the vote will go ahead with Odinga on the ballot.

This week, police raided homes belonging to wealthy opposition financier Jimi Wanjigi and said they had found a cache of weapons. Wanjigi said in an emotional interview that the firearms were licensed and that he was being persecuted.

On Tuesday, Deputy President William Ruto said Odinga had pulled out of the race to avoid a “humiliating defeat”.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nothing will concentrate the minds of North Korean leaders more than a Chinese oil embargo. Nearly 90 percent of the country’s petroleum comes across the border, giving Beijing enormous leverage. Cutting off these shipments would swiftly weaken the North’s military capacity and help restart negotiations.

The Chinese are already moving towards the ultimate oil sanction. They have announced that they will tighten banking support for North Korea, but this will take time and be pursued in a gradualist way to guard against any damage to China’s banks.

They have also just announced that starting on Oct. 1, China will cut annual exports of refined petroleum to North Korea by about 10 percent to two million barrels. This is a warning, I believe, of tighter restrictions ahead; I expect the Chinese leadership may announce further action on oil trade during the month when President Donald Trump visits Beijing.

The key right now is to de-escalate the rhetoric so that paramount leader Kim Jong Un does not increase the tempo of missile and nuclear tests, with all the risks of devastating accidents they entail. Trump also needs to understand that securing China’s full support will require that there be no international incident in the runup to the vitally important 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party that starts on Oct. 18, a significant event that occurs every five years that typically sees a major reshuffle of the leadership. President Xi Jinping wants to enter this forum looking strong and emerge even stronger.

It is possible that the Chinese leadership has explained the importance of the congress to the White House, over diplomatic channels and otherwise. Steve Bannon may no longer have a White House office, but he almost certainly still has Trump’s ear, and Bannon recently held a 90-minute meeting in China with Wang Qishan – Xi’s most trusted colleague on the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s most powerful political body.

Xi’s first important foreign guest after the congress concludes will be Trump. If Xi further consolidates power as expected, then the U.S. leader will confront a confident Chinese counterpart who may well be willing to deal on a whole array of issues, from trade and security in the South China Sea, to what to do about Kim Jong Un.

The Chinese do not want a greater humanitarian crisis in North Korea that could see a refugee migration into China, and so they will not pursue an across-the-board trade embargo. But a major cut-off in refined petroleum exports would hit North Korea’s conventional forces hard enough.

Trump now needs to convince Xi to do just that. He may need to tone down tough trade rhetoric in exchange; he certainly needs to tone down the sabre-rattling.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC is leaning toward extending a deal with Russia and other non-members to cut oil supply for a further nine months, four OPEC sources said, although stronger-than-expected demand growth may allow the group to delay a decision until early next year.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018, in an attempt to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

After slow initial progress, OPEC is more confident the cut is working. Oil prices are near a two-year high, supported by falling stocks, strong global demand, a slowdown in U.S. shale output and high overall adherence to producers’ supply pledges.

Three OPEC sources said keeping the curbs in place until the end of 2018 was a likely outcome, while a fourth said an extension of six to nine months would be needed to remove all excess oil in storage.

“If demand growth is performing very well, then the decision might be postponed till early next year,” one of the four OPEC sources said. “But there is still a big chance for it to be taken in November.”

Discussions among producers are continuing in the run-up to the next OPEC meeting to set oil policy on Nov. 30 in Vienna.

Before then, OPEC’s board of governors, who do not decide policy, will meet in Vienna on Oct. 23-24 and are likely informally to discuss options and scenarios, OPEC sources said.

If a decision is not announced in November, OPEC and its allies could meet in early 2018, two OPEC sources said. Usually, OPEC holds each year’s first policy-setting meeting in May or June.

OPEC wants to reduce the level of oil stocks in developed economies to the five-year average. The latest figures show this is in progress but not yet complete.

In August, OPEC said such stocks stood at 2.996 billion barrels, 171 million barrels above the five-year average, reducing the excess from 340 million barrels in January.

DEEPER CUT UNLIKELY

Deepening the cut, which OPEC decided against when it last met in May, is not considered likely this time, two OPEC sources said, since some producers would struggle to reduce output further.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Oct. 4 the deal could be extended to the end of 2018, although OPEC ministers have not given specific commitments on doing so.

A strengthening of the oil market has reduced the urgency of further measures. With Brent crude trading at $58 a barrel, it is within sight of the $60 mark that Saudi Arabia considers a good level.

OPEC and other forecasters have been raising their projections for growth in global oil demand. The latest monthly OPEC report pointed to a supply deficit on the world market next year if OPEC keeps output at September’s level.

Kuwait’s oil minister said on Sunday the market was moving in the right direction and it was too early to decide on extending the supply cut.

But OPEC sources say prolonging the agreement, with nine months as the timeframe, is likely.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

Il ricavato dell‘offerta, spiega una nota della società, sarà utilizzato insieme ai 3,4 miliardi di euro derivanti da un nuovo contratto di finanziamento, per rimborsare l‘indebitamento finanziario e i finanziamenti infra-gruppo erogati da parte della controllata Wind Acquisition Finance (Waf), consentendo a quest‘ultima di rimborsare tutti i titoli senior e senior secured da essa emessi.

Nella nota si legge che Waf ha quindi annunciato una contestuale offerta di riacquisto su quattro bond propri in circolazione. L‘offerta sarà in contanti e si chiuderà il prossimo 15 novembre.

Nel dettaglio, l‘offerta di buyback è sui seguenti bond: 2019 tasso variabile (da 150 milioni di euro), 2020 cedola 6,5% (da 550 milioni di dollari), 2021 cedola 7,375% (da 2,8 miliardi di dollari) e 2021 cedola 7% (da 1,75 miliardi di euro). I prezzi di riacquisto sono rispettivamente di 100,115, 103,402, 103,860 e 103,663 qualora l‘adesione all‘offerta avvenga entro il 31 ottobre; dopo tale data i prezzi di riacquisto vengono ridotti ciascuno di 3 centesimi.

DEBITO

“L‘operazione di rifinanziamento è mirata ad ottenere un significativo miglioramento della struttura del capitale della società riducendo i costi relativi agli interessi ed estendendo le scadenze” dice la nota del gruppo.

Come osserva un banchiere coinvolto, con il rimborso dei bond Waf, l‘intera operazione permetterà al gruppo telefonico di avere una struttura di debito “più semplice, a un unico piano e con un unico rating, rispetto a quella attuale a due piani con rating diversi”.

Per Moody’s Wind Tre ha attualmente rating B1 mentre Waf B3 (entrambi con outlook positivo); per S&P entrambe hanno rating BB- (con outlook stabile).

Al 30 giugno scorso, la struttura di debito di Wind Tre comprendeva bond per oltre 10 miliardi di euro complessivi (sia in euro sia in dollari), su varie scadenze tra il 2019 e il 2021; tra le altre poste più significative c‘è un ‘term loan’ bancario da 690 milioni e prestiti dagli azionisti per 1,74 miliardi.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Theresa May will make a pitch to fellow EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday as she tries to break a deadlock in Brexit talks that has left Britain’s future trading position up in the air.

But EU officials expect no movement in negotiating positions from either side before the other 27 leaders deliver a verdict on progress on Friday that will say Britain must up its offer on divorce terms before they will even talk about trade.

“We do not expect at this stage any new initiatives between now and the European Council,” said an EU official, who said May had asked to address the summit.

The others will not negotiate with her but will discuss Brexit after May leaves on Friday.

They plan to reject her call for an immediate start to talks on a future trade relationship but make a “gesture” recognizing the concessions May offered in a speech at Florence last month by telling EU staff to prepare for talks on a transition period.

Stepping personally into the breach after Brexit Secretary David Davis’s four months of discussions struck deadlock last week, May had dinner in Brussels on Monday with EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and his negotiator Michel Barnier.

But she came away with just a joint pledge to “accelerate” the process.

There is a catch: the EU will not discuss relations in the future until London agrees to pay tens of billions of euros (dollars) in a divorce settlement for obligations incurred in the past. May, beset by demands from hardline Brexit supporters to simply walk away without any deal, says the bill can be worked out only when the future relationship is clearer.

“It takes two to accelerate,” Barnier told reporters as he arrived to brief EU ministers in Luxembourg. “One step after another... We are not finished with the first step.”

May’s spokesman said she was pleased with a dinner that ended with an embrace at the door from Juncker. But he added: “We can only resolve the financial implications of the UK’s withdrawal ... as part of the settlement of all the issues.”

MERKEL-MACRON FRONT

May came away similarly empty-handed from telephone calls to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, leaders of the Union’s leading powers whose diplomats have taken a hard line this month in limiting the scope of the gesture on transition preparations which Barnier had proposed.

People familiar with those calls on Sunday and Monday said May echoed emotional complaints from British negotiators last week that her Florence speech, offering to “honor commitments” made by Britain, deserved a more generous response from the EU.

Macron and Merkel, who are coordinating closely, were clear that they will negotiate at the stage only through Barnier, a former French foreign minister, officials said.

And they insisted Britain settled outstanding issues first, despite increasingly vocal calls from business on both sides of the English Channel for clarity by early next year at the latest in order to plan investments for after Brexit in March 2019.

BusinessEurope, which represents employers federations across the continent including Britain’s CBI, was the latest, saying it was “extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations” and telling EU summit chair Donald Tusk in a letter that “business wants to avoid a cliff edge”.

EU leaders plan to issue a statement after May leaves on Friday saying that they hope a deal can be struck at their next summit in December and that things can move swiftly then.

But after losing her majority in June, May has little room for maneuver at home: “It’s all about the money and if she ups the bid now, that is a really hard sell politically,” a senior source in her Conservative Party told Reuters.

British efforts to remind continental neighbors of how much they also have to lose if trade is disrupted are showing little return, even among close trading partners with most at stake.

“Sometimes it’s very difficult to see and understand what Britain really wants from these negotiations,” Finnish minister Samuli Virtanen said.

Brexit minister Davis, who long campaigned to take Britain out of the EU, said London had no plan to walk away from talks but should maintain the option in negotiations. Yet interior minister Amber Rudd, who opposed Brexit in the referendum, said shortly afterward that it was “unthinkable” that the two sides would fail to strike a deal as it was in their own interests.",May to pitch on Brexit at EU summit dinner,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/may-to-pitch-on-brexit-at-eu-summit-dinner-idUKKBN1CM2O5

LONDON (Reuters) - Former bosses of Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) used “spin and sales puff” to win over investors and secure a “disastrous” acquisition of rival HBOS during the credit crisis, a lawyer for thousands of shareholders told London’s High Court on Wednesday.

Around 6,000 Lloyds investors, who are seeking around 550 million pounds in damages, allege that five former directors at Lloyds, including ex-CEO Eric Daniels, concealed information about HBOS’s financial position in 2008 and 2009 and breached their duties by recommending the purchase.

On the first day of a 14-week London trial, the claimant’s lawyer Richard Hill told the court that the deal saved HBOS from nationalisation but looked like a catastrophe for Lloyds within days of completion in early 2009.

“We say shareholders were indeed mugged,” Hill said, adding that former Lloyds executives such as Daniels also glossed over severe problems with HBOS’s liquidity and corporate loan portfolio when presenting the case to the board.

Lloyds, Britain’s largest retail bank, and the individual defendants, who include former chairman Victor Blank, Tim Tookey, the former finance director, Helen Weir, the former head of retail and Truett Tate, the former head of wholesale banking, deny any wrongdoing.

“The group’s position remains that we do not consider there to be any merit to these claims and we will robustly contest this legal action,” the bank said in a statement. All defendants are being collectively represented by Lloyds lawyers.

It is the second British investor lawsuit against a bank stemming from the credit crisis - and the first to go to trial. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) reached an out-of-court settlement over a 2008 cash call shortly before a trial scheduled in June.

HBOS, formed from the merger in 2001 of former English building society Halifax and the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland, was close to collapse in 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers caused money markets to seize up, meaning HBOS could not get the funding it needed for its ballooning loan book.

Lloyds shareholders allege the subsequent government-brokered takeover of HBOS, that valued the struggling bank at around 5.9 billion pounds, wiped billions off the bank’s market value. Lloyds itself then had to be rescued with a 20.5 billion- pound government bailout in 2009.

Investors allege Lloyds secretly loaned HBOS 10 billion pounds in 2008 so it could continue trading and that the bank’s directors did not disclose that HBOS was receiving emergency support from the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which peaked at about 25.6 billion pounds and $18 billion (£13.6 billion) respectively.

Hill said Daniels and Blank were put under pressure by the government in 2008 to rescue HBOS but owed their allegiance to Lloyds shareholders.

Lloyds, which has returned to profit and emerged from state ownership in May, denies the claims and says the bank and the ex-directors all acted properly.","Ex-Lloyds bank bosses used 'spin and puff' in HBOS deal, court told",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lloyds-hbos-shareholders/ex-lloyds-bank-bosses-used-spin-and-puff-in-hbos-deal-court-told-idUKKBN1CN299

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo

LONDON (Reuters) - British pay growth has lagged behind inflation again, official data showed on Wednesday, adding to questions about how quickly the Bank of England will raise interest rates after an initial hike expected on Nov. 2.

The British central bank looks on course to deliver its first increase in borrowing costs in a decade, most economists said after the data, reversing last year’s rate cut that followed Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.

Britain’s jobless rate between June and August held at a 42-year low of 4.3 percent, one reason why the BoE thinks pay is likely to pick up soon.

And while overall annual pay growth of 2.2 percent was weaker than inflation - which hit 3 percent in September, its highest level since 2012 - it was slightly above a median forecast of 2.1 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.

There was slightly stronger growth for workers in the private sector, the Office for National Statistics said.

“I can’t see anything in these numbers that will alter the Bank of England’s thinking,” Sam Hill, an economist with RBC Capital Markets, said.

However, the stubborn gap between weak wage growth and high inflation meant there was “considerable doubt” about further rate hikes in 2018, he said.

Britain, like the United States and other rich economies, has seen a sharp fall in unemployment which would normally fuel inflation, according to established economic theory. But wages on both sides of the Atlantic have failed to rise in a significant way since the financial crisis a decade ago.

WEAK GROWTH

Despite a slowdown in Britain’s economy this year which has been linked to last year’s Brexit vote shock, the BoE is widely expected to return rates to 0.50 percent from 0.25 percent on Nov. 2, at the end of its next meeting.

Sterling rose briefly after Wednesday’s figures and government bond prices fell slightly before reverting to earlier levels.

The BoE expects pay growth to pick up speed soon because the unemployment rate is below the 4.5 percent level it sees as a trigger for inflation pressure in the economy. It also thinks Brexit will increase price growth in Britain.

However, comments by two BoE policymakers on Tuesday, who noted the weak growth in wages, were seen by investors as a sign of disagreement at the central bank on rate hikes after an initial increase.

The ONS said pay excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1 percent, also a touch stronger than the Reuters poll forecast of 2.0 percent.

In August alone, total wages picked up speed to grow by 2.2 percent after a slowdown in July to 1.7 percent.

The BoE expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up to 3 percent in 2018 and 3.25 percent in 2019.

The number of people in work rose by 94,000 in the three months to August, about half the increase in the three months to July but still a relatively strong rate of growth.

The steady loss of spending power for households is not just a headache for the BoE. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised help for households and has proposed a cap on power tariffs.

Finance minister Philip Hammond is under pressure to come up with further measures when he announces his budget plan in November. But he has little margin for error given the still weak state of Britain’s public finances.","UK pay lags inflation again, BoE still seen raising rates",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-jobs/uk-pay-lags-inflation-again-boe-still-seen-raising-rates-idUKKBN1CN0YW

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - O Ministério Público Federal (MPF) apresentou denúncia nesta quarta-feira contra o ex-presidente do Comitê Olímpico do Brasil (COB) Carlos Arthur Nuzman por corrupção, organização criminosa, lavagem de dinheiro e evasão de divisas por suspeita de compra de votos na eleição que escolheu o Rio de Janeiro como sede dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016.

Além de Nuzman, também foram denunciados o ex-diretor de marketing do COB Leonardo Gryner, por corrupção e organização criminosa, e o ex-governador Sérgio Cabral, o empresário Arthur Soares e os senegaleses Papa Massata Diack e Lamine Diack, por corrupção, informou o MPF.

Nuzman foi preso pela Polícia Federal em 5 de outubro acusado de intermediar a compra de votos de dirigentes africanos, por meio dos Diack, na eleição realizada pelo Comitê Olímpico Internacional (COI) em 2009, com dinheiro proveniente do esquema de corrupção liderado pelo então governador Cabral, que também está preso.

Nuzman renunciou à presidência do COB, que comandava há 22 anos, após a prisão. Gryner também foi preso pela PF na mesma operação, mas recebeu direito à liberdado posteriormente.

Segundo a denúncia, os dirigentes esportivos e o então governador viabilizaram pagamento de 2 milhões de dólares do empresário Soares aos senegaleses para garantir a vitória do Rio de Janeiro.

O Rio foi eleito sede dos Jogos Olímpicos em uma votação em que derrotou Chicago, Tóquio e Madri. Na votação final, contra a cidade espanhola, a candidatura carioca obteve um triunfo com margem folgada, 66 votos a 32.

Para o MPF, Nuzman e Gryner são equiparados a funcionários públicos, porque tanto o COB como o Comitê Rio 2016, responsável pela organização dos Jogos, eram gestores de verbas públicas recebidas pelas instituições e exerciam atividade típica de Estado, o esporte.

“A despeito de tratar-se de uma ‘pessoa jurídica de direito privado’, o Comitê Olímpico do Brasil, por meio de seus dirigentes, representa a República Federativa do Brasil em eventos esportivos internacionais, recebe verba pública (que representa a maior parte de seu orçamento) e, ainda, exerce uma atividade típica da Administração Pública Federal ao fomentar e organizar as atividades desportivas olímpicas no Brasil”, disseram os procuradores do MPF na denúncia.

“Onde existe verba pública, existe dever de probidade e existe a responsabilidade daqueles que a gerem, podendo, portanto, ser responsabilizados quando atuarem em contrariedade ao que determina a lei.”

Procurada, a defesa de Nuzman não tinha um posicionamento de imediato sobre a apresentação da denúncia. Não foi possível fazer contato com representantes dos outros denunciados.

Nuzman, que também foi o presidente do Comitê Rio 2016, teve bens bloqueados pela Justiça Federal e foi proibido de sair do país até a conclusão das investigações da chamada operação Unfair Play, que resultou em bloqueio de ativos de suspeitos no total de 1 bilhão de reais.

Com o avanço das investigações, os procuradores descobriram que Nuzman mantinha recursos ocultos no exterior e só os declarou à Receita Federal após a deflagração da ação no mês passado, incluindo 16 barras de ouro, de 1 quilo cada, depositadas na Suíça. Segundo o MPF, o valor atual das barras de ouro seria equivalente a cerca de 1,5 milhão de reais.

De acordo com o MPF, não há confirmação até o momento de propinas pagas a Nuzman, mas foi identificado um aumento patrimonial do dirigente de 416 por cento entre 2006 e 2016.",Nuzman é denunciado em investigação sobre corrupção na eleição para Olimpíada do Rio,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idBRKBN1CN215-OBRSP

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

The pro-government electoral council announced in the middle of the night that the ruling socialists had won the governorship of Bolivar state, meaning President Nicolas Maduro’s government took 18 of 23 states in Sunday’s gubernatorial vote.

Polls had put the opposition far ahead in Sunday’s vote, and anti-Maduro politicians have alleged a litany of dirty tricks including switching electoral centers to dangerous areas at the eleventh hour and abuse of state resources.

However, they have failed to give evidence of ballot-tampering, and some opposition candidates have conceded they lost due to high abstention in their demoralized ranks.

Still, the disparate opposition coalition said its five winning candidates would not be sworn in by the controversial legislative superbody known as the Constituent Assembly.

“The governors-elect will only be sworn in as established in the constitution and the laws of the Republic,” the Democratic Unity coalition said in a statement on Wednesday.

Leftist Maduro has previously said that governors not sworn in by the pro-government legislative body will not be allowed to govern in the country reeling from widespread food and medicine shortages, a collapsing currency, and soaring inflation.

BOLIVAR FLASHPOINT

The southern state of Bolivar is becoming a flashpoint after the electoral council briefly showed the opposition candidate winning on its web site Sunday night before proclaiming the Socialist Party candidate as winner in the early hours of Wednesday.

Opposition candidate Andres Velasquez says he is the true winner, and accused the electoral council of invalidating some ballots cast for him. He has not provided evidence.

Pockets of his supporters have been massing outside the electoral board’s offices in state capital Ciudad Bolivar, with some clashes breaking out on Monday and Tuesday. Some 50 people were gathered outside the offices on Wednesday morning and more clashes were expected.

“I am going to demonstrate to the world that this electoral process is fraudulent,” Velasquez told a local radio station in Bolivar, home to much of Venezuela’s gold and diamond mines.

However, nationwide protest like those that rocked Venezuela for four months earlier this year are not expected, given fatigue and disappointment among demonstrators.

The perennially divided opposition is in disarray after Sunday’s election, with some leaders calling fraud and others conceding defeat, often in uncoordinated press statements.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall about 1.3 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million.

The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing.

A Ford spokeswoman said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones.

Ford said the cost of the new recall would be reflected in its fourth-quarter results. Ford said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85‍​ per share.

The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving.

Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.

Ford previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in August 2016.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is tightening quality controls for consumer and capital goods, officials say, a move that follows calls to curb cheap imports from China amid diplomatic tensions between the world’s two most populous nations over their shared border.

The new rules target toys, electronic goods, machinery, food processing, construction and chemicals, sectors dominated by China, and come amid greater scrutiny of mainland firms looking to enter India’s multi-billion dollar power transmission and telecoms business.

For India’s toy retailers, who import everything from toy cars to musical phones and even robots from China, the new requirements have meant supply disruptions just ahead of the Diwali festive season.

The government’s Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has approximately 23,000 standards across industries, many of which are never fully enforced, officials say. Now, government departments have been asked to carry out laboratory tests and spot inspection to ensure goods conform to the regulations.

“We have started this work on a war footing, to have quality control orders for almost every product that we are consuming in the country,” said Ramesh Abhishek who heads the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.

The new rules apply to both foreign manufacturers and domestic firms.

However, two people familiar with trade policy who did not want to be named said the sectors targeted are ones in which China controls more than two-thirds of the market, such as toy and stainless steel good industries, and where there have been “chronic” complaints of substandard products.

Separately, Indian Steel Secretary Aruna Sharma said her department will soon release new guidelines, raising quality norms for welded stainless steel pipes that are used in oil and gas as well as construction sector.

“There is evidence of China exporting semi-finished and finished goods using stainless steel that do not meet the BIS standards,” Sharma said.

India’s trade ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment on the new rules. China’s Foreign Ministry referred questions to the Commerce Ministry, which did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Bilateral trade between India and China boomed to $71.45 billion in 2016-17 from $1.83 billion in 1999-2000, though most of this is skewed to Chinese exports.

The trade deficit has widened to $51.1 billion over the past year, a nine-fold increase over the last decade, despite repeated Indian calls for China to address the imbalance and open its markets.

Those trade differences are now being amplified by the resurfacing of a long-running border dispute, which has stirred protectionist sentiment in India.

In June, a nationalist group tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party began a campaign to discourage the use of Chinese goods in the country.

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an affiliate of the main Hindu nationalist organisation that fights for domestic industry and agriculture, has planned a protest rally in Delhi later this month against the influx of Chinese products.

TOYS FROM CHINA

The new testing requirements for toys focus on their chemical content and flammability and demand more stringent testing for those that are electrically operated.

China accounts for 85 percent of India’s $760 million toy industry and these are priced at anything from 50 cents to $150.

Several toy importers are urging the government to delay the new regulations until the festival season is over, saying it would choke supply.

“It comes out of the blue, with no forewarning and gives no time for retailers to prepare for compliance,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India that represents over 1,000 members.

“As a result, it will have grave consequences, such as losses in terms of huge amounts of money paid as advance by retailers to suppliers overseas and a loss of jobs as some businesses that sell only toys will have to shut shop.”

While the new rules could hurt local retail consumption, other industry participants argue they will ultimately help local firms by improving standards and keeping low-end imports in check.

They follow similar moves in August, when the government ordered makers of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs to register their products with the BIS for safety checks in an industry where smuggling of Chinese products is rampant.

“There is a need for stronger enforcement for compliance to these standards,” said Sumit Joshi, vice chairman and managing director, Philips Lighting India, the country’s largest LED maker.",India's tightened consumer goods standards could hurt China imports,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-china-trade/indias-tightened-consumer-goods-standards-could-hurt-china-imports-idINKBN1CN18D

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the U.S. director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues.","Having the right name at the right, or sometimes wrong, time",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKCN1C425Q

KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - Kurdish Peshmerga forces have retreated to positions they held in northern Iraq in June 2014 in response to an Iraqi army advance into the region after a Kurdish independence referendum, a senior Iraqi commander said on Wednesday.

An Iraqi military statement said government forces had taken control of Kurdish-held areas of Nineveh province, including the Mosul hydro-electric dam, on Tuesday after the Peshmerga pulled back. On Monday, Baghdad’s forces recaptured the major oil city of Kirkuk to the south shortly after the Peshmerga abandoned it.

The Peshmerga had advanced into Nineveh and the Kirkuk region over the past three years as part of the war against Islamic State militants, filling a void left by a temporary collapse of the Iraqi army in the face of an IS onslaught.

“As of today we reversed the clock back to 2014,” the Iraqi army commander, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. There was no immediate comment from Kurdish leaders.

The territory taken by the Peshmerga as it rolled back Islamic State was outside the official boundaries of the autonomous Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), mainly in Kurdish-populated areas claimed historically by the Kurds.

With this week’s withdrawals from disputed territories, Peshmerga forces appeared to have re-deployed roughly along the KRG’s boundaries.

Iran and Turkey joined the Baghdad government in condemning the Iraqi Kurds’ Sept. 25 referendum, worried it could worsen regional instability and conflict by encouraging their own Kurdish populations to push for homelands.

With the referendum having given Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi a political opening to regain contested land and shift the balance of power in his favour, it may prove a gamble that makes the KRG’s quest for statehood more elusive.

61,200 DISPLACED BY IRAQI ADVANCE

Around 61,200 people were displaced Iraq’s military operation in and around Kirkuk, a city of over 1 million, over the past 48 hours but most were now returning to their homes, the U.N. humanitarian affairs office in Baghdad said.

Witnesses said, however, that dozens of Kurdish families began to flee Kirkuk on Wednesday for Sulaimaniya inside the KRG for fear of attack by Shi‘ite Popular Mobilisation paramilitaries, allied with Baghdad and armed by Iran, that had entered the city along with government forces.

“We have a family member with the Peshmerga and we are afraid we might get arrested by the Popular Mobilisation. We are fleeing towards Sulaimaniya,” said the driver of one car filled with his family.

At least 150 vehicles were seen streaming out of Kirkuk at one point. But most subsequently turned around and returned home after local police assured them that fears of reprisals were groundless, a Reuters reporter said.

Though Kurdish-owned shops in Kirkuk were mainly closed on Wednesday due to concern about the presence of Shi‘ite militia, there were no reports of serious incidents as federal security forces patrolled the streets, witnesses said.

“We call on all parties to do everything possible to shield and protect all civilians impacted by the current situation,” Lisa Grande, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said.

Abadi ordered the prosecution of anyone found circulating fake videos aimed at inciting strife between Kurds and Arabs and endangering civil peace in areas retaken by Baghdad’s forces.

The Kurdish vote was championed by KRG President and KDP party chief Masoud Barzani but not supported by the rival PUK party, in part because of the strong opposition of the Kurds’ longtime ally the United States.

The United States sided with Abadi’s Shi‘ite-led government in rejecting the Kurds’ secessionist move. Barzani has stood by it, saying the overwhelming “yes” for independence “won’t be in vain” and would be pursued by peaceful means.

Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire fell apart and left Kurdish-populated land split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.",Kurdish forces withdraw to June 2014 lines - Iraqi army commander,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds/kurdish-forces-withdraw-to-june-2014-lines-iraqi-army-commander-idINKBN1CN1AZ

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

“Tomara, eu tenho essa esperança, mas não acho fácil”, disse o ministro a jornalistas após participar do lançamento de consulta pública sobre a nova política de telecomunicações do governo federal.

O ministério de Kassab integra um grupo de trabalho liderado pela Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU) que está discutindo saídas para a dívida da Oi, principalmente os mais de 10 bilhões de reais em multas devidos à Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações (Anatel).

A Agência confirmou nesta quarta-feira que escolheu seu superintendente-executivo, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, para representar o órgão regulador na assembleia de credores da operadora. Na terça, uma fonte de governo havia antecipado à Reuters que a Anatel já havia escolhido quem a representaria na reunião da próxima segunda-feira.

PLANO DE TELECOMUNICAÇÕES

O governo lançou nesta quarta-feira a consulta pública de seu novo decreto para a política de telecomunicações, com foco na expansão da banda larga.

Segundo o secretário de Telecomunicações do ministério de Kassab, André Borges, o plano prevê, por exemplo, apoiar projetos já existentes no Congresso que viabilizem a criação de um fundo, a partir de uma reformulação do Fundo de Universalização dos Servições de Telecomunicações (Fust), mas destinado à banda larga.

A ideia do ministério é que esse novo fundo não tenha seus recursos contingenciados, como ocorre com o FUST, para poder ajudar a financiar investimentos em banda larga.

“A longo prazo, nós dependemos da revisão, sim, de um fundo de universalização dos serviços, que é o serviço de banda larga em todo o país”, disse Borges.

Esse novo fundo teria a mesma base de arrecadação do atual Fust, segundo o secretário.

O plano conta também com a aprovação do projeto de lei que permita a mudança do regime de concessão para autorização para as operadoras de telefonia fixa.

Segundo Borges, o projeto prevê que as empresas que mudem de regime paguem uma espécie de bônus e esses recursos também poderiam ser usados nos projetos de banda larga.

Lloyd Blankfein’s firm cranked out $2 billion of earnings in the three months to the end of September, at an annualized return on equity of 10.9 percent. That bested the 9.6 percent showing of Goldman’s main Wall Street rival – the first time this year that it has come out ahead. Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman, though, has crafted a more attractive-looking business for the longer term.

Goldman still has strengths. The blue-chip firm came back from a dismal first-half performance trading fixed income, currencies and commodities, reporting a 26 percent year-on-year decline in revenue from that business. While horrid, that places Goldman in the Wall Street pack rather than behind it. And the firm leads its peers in merger advice. Fees generated by Goldman’s dealmakers increased by 38 percent in the quarter, year on year, where the industry fee pool fell by 9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The trouble is that most of Goldman’s outperformance last quarter is thanks to gains on its private-equity portfolio, which helped push revenue in its equity investing division up by more than half to $1.4 billion. Without that, the bank’s annualized return on equity would have been less than 9 percent. Such gains tend to be lumpy so they can’t be relied upon every quarter.

Morgan Stanley’s earnings look more repeatable. That’s in large part because wealth management is now purring along nicely, even managing a 26.5 percent pre-tax margin, which beats Gorman’s target for the year. The unit brings in almost half the company’s revenue using just a quarter of its capital. Blankfein’s efforts to diversify Goldman’s earnings are still relatively tiny – one example is Marcus, the fast-growing but small retail-banking business. Gorman also has a fixed-income trading business that has weathered recent storms far better than Blankfein’s.

All in, that means Morgan Stanley may not provide as many thrills as Goldman, but it also ought to avoid many of the spills.

REUTERS/Mike Segar

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Tuesday asked the Defense Department to explain how it manages the risks when it uses software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments, saying the practice may represent a national security threat.

Reuters reported earlier this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co allowed a Russian defense agency to review the source code or inner workings of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

”HPE’s ArcSight system constitutes a significant element of the U.S. military’s cyber defenses,” Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis seen by Reuters.

Shaheen, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said disclosure of ArcSight’s source code to the Russian agency presented an “opportunity to exploit a system used on [Defense Department] platforms.”

Shaheen questioned whether the Trump administration was pushing back on demands for source code from Russia and elsewhere that are imposed on U.S. companies as a condition for entry into foreign markets.

Such reviews highlight a quandary for U.S. technology companies, as they weigh U.S. cyber security protections while pursuing business with some of Washington’s adversaries, including Russia and China, according to security experts.

“I understand that individual businesses must make decisions weighing the risk of intellectual property disclosure against the opportunity of accessing significant overseas markets,” Shaheen wrote. “However, when such products undergird [Defense Department] cyber defenses, our national security may be at stake in these decisions.”

The Pentagon and HPE did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the letter.

Cyber security experts, former U.S. intelligence officials and former ArcSight employees said the review of ArcSight’s core instruction, also known as source code, could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping hackers to blind the U.S. military to an attack.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews, by a Russian government-accredited testing company, have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervises the process and that no code is allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it does not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said last week that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

HPE was spun off from Hewlett-Packard Inc as a separate software company in 2015.

Shaheen’s letter asked Mattis whether he foresaw risks associated with the disclosure of ArcSight’s code and whether the Pentagon was monitoring whether technology vendors share source code or “other sensitive technical data.”

She also asked how frequently vendors disclose the source code of products used by the Pentagon to foreign governments.

Shaheen recently led successful efforts in Congress to ban all government use of software provided by Moscow-based antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab, amid allegations the company is allied with Russian intelligence. Kaspersky vehemently denies such links.

Tech companies have been under increasing pressure to allow the Russian government to examine source code in exchange for approvals to sell products in Russia. While many Western firms have complied, some, including California-based cyber firm Symantec, have refused.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

The open-ended ban, announced last month, targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. It was the third version of a policy that had previously targeted some Muslim-majority countries but had been restricted by the courts.

Tuesday’s ruling sets up another high stakes battle over Trump’s executive authority which legal experts expect will ultimately land in the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump’s first travel ban in January caused chaos and protests at U.S. airports before judges halted it.

The state of Hawaii sued to block Trump’s latest travel restrictions, arguing that federal immigration law did not give him the authority to impose them on six of those countries. Hawaii did not challenge entry restrictions relating to North Korea and Venezuela.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu said Hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that Trump’s latest travel ban violates federal immigration law.

The policy “suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be ‘detrimental to the interests of the United States,'” Watson wrote.

The White House in a statement said the ruling was “dangerously flawed” and that it was confident the courts would ultimately uphold Trump’s policy.

“These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our nation,” the statement said.

The Justice Department called Watson’s ruling “incorrect” and said it would appeal “in an expeditious manner.”

Following the ruling, the U.S. State Department instructed embassies and consulates around the world to “resume regular processing of visas” for citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, a department official said on condition of anonymity.

The department will carry out the proclamation for North Korea and Venezuela “with the objective of maximizing national security,” the official said, because the order did not apply to restrictions on those countries.

As a candidate, Trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

In announcing the newest travel restrictions, the White House had portrayed them as necessary consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas. Those requirements were shared in July with foreign governments, which had 50 days to make improvements if needed, the White House said.

A number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen. Others did not, sparking the restrictions.

Immigrant advocacy groups cheered the Hawaii ruling.

“We’re glad, but not surprised, that President Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional Muslim ban has been blocked once again,” Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants Rights Project, said in a statement.

The ACLU and other groups have filed separate challenges to Trump’s policy in a Maryland federal court. A ruling is still pending.

In the Hawaii case, the judge said that the ban’s national security rationale was undermined by not knowing how the president settled on the countries designated by the ban.

The judge also said the proclamation likely runs afoul of a prohibition in immigration law on nationality-based discrimination in issuing visas. Watson had blocked Trump’s second travel ban in March.

In a statement on Tuesday, Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said: “Today is another victory for the rule of law.”

Kiyanoush Razaghi, an immigration attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network who has many Iranian clients, said Iranians still have problems when applying for U.S. visas, including particularly lengthy wait times for security checks.

Razaghi said he has told his clients: “You can celebrate, there is no travel ban right now, but be careful because that doesn’t mean you are going to get a visa in a reasonable amount of time.”",Judge blocks latest Trump curbs on people entering United States,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ruling/u-s-judge-blocks-latest-trump-travel-restrictions-idUSKBN1CM2QX

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Wednesday named control of the interior ministry as its price for joining a future coalition government following its strong showing in a parliamentary election.

The anti-immigrant, anti-Islam FPO won around 26 percent of votes cast in Sunday’s election. The conservative People’s Party (OVP) won most votes by also taking a hard line on immigration, while the centre-left Social Democrats took second place.

Asked if the FPO would stick by its pre-election insistence that it would only join a future coalition if its candidate became interior minister, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters: “Yes.”

“We won’t go down on our knees for anyone. At 26 percent we naturally aim to implement our (FPO) policies in government,” Strache added.

The interior ministry in Austria oversees asylum claims and the fight against terrorism, among other responsibilities.

Austria’s president will on Friday formally ask Sebastian Kurz, leader of the OVP, the largest party at around 32 percent, to start negotiations on forming a new coalition government.

The OVP and the FPO overlap in their plans to curb immigration, cut social benefits for refugees, reduce the tax burden on companies and work towards repatriating powers to national governments from Brussels while strengthening external border security.

SPURNING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS

All parties have kept their coalition options open, but the Social Democrats (SPO) are technically still bound by a party conference decision from 2014 that bans it from entering into a coalition government with the Freedom Party.

Slideshow (4 Images)

Under Austria’s outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, Christian Kern, the SPO has opened up significantly to the Freedom Party by introducing a so-called “value compass” for potential partners which does not specifically rule out working with the Freedom Party.

But Strache said on Wednesday that as long as there was no fresh vote among the Social Democrats’ base to formally annul the 2014 decision, talk of his party teaming up with the SPO was “theoretical”.

Influential FPO official Manfred Haimbuchner told newspaper Der Standard that he definitely preferred his party to form a government with the conservatives.

The FPO was founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s and first became a major political force in the 1990s under the charismatic Joerg Haider, who praised Hitler’s employment policies.

Today the party says it has put its Nazi past behind it and purged its ranks of anti-Semitism but still frequently has to expel members for anti-Semitic comments. It has, however, stopped calling for Austria to leave the European Union.

Rajoy issued his appeal in the national parliament, where he sought to win more political support for taking direct control of Catalonia on Thursday if the rebel regional government sticks to a plan to break away.

The move would need only a vote in Spain’s upper house, where Rajoy’s People’s Party holds an absolute majority.

It would be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that direct rule has been imposed.

A constitutional provision allows the central government to impose the law by giving orders to all branches of the regional authorities. Precisely how that would work in practical matters such as commanding the police force is untested.

Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers.

Many Spaniards fear the unprecedented step could lead to social unrest. The crisis has prompted hundreds of Catalan firms to move their headquarters, led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts and weighed on the euro.

In the latest grim prediction, Spain’s independent budget watchdog warned on Wednesday that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off the economy next year, reducing expected growth by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points.

Puigdemont has already defied Madrid once this week, reiterating on Monday an ambiguous independence declaration he made last week and immediately suspended.

“I ask Puigdemont to act sensibly, in a balanced way, to put the interests of all citizens first,” Rajoy said on Wednesday, mentioning both residents of the autonomous region, which produces a fifth of Spain’s wealth and has its own language and culture, and the rest of the country.

Thursday’s deadline is Puigdemont’s last chance to abandon an independence declaration which Madrid has rejected as illegal, and defuse Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

“It’s not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not we can talk here,” Rajoy said in parliament.

The row has rattled financial markets and sent companies scurrying to relocate on safer ground. Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, was considering moving its top management to Madrid.

Almost 700 companies pulled out of the northeastern region between Oct. 2 - the day after a referendum on independence which Madrid branded illegal - and Oct. 16, according to Spain’s companies registry.

Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centered on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday.

The region’s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter “if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months”, Exceltur said in a statement.

THREAT OF DIRECT RULE

Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that exactly what direct rule would look like is not clear, adding the government would work on it.

La Vanguardia said Puigdemont, a 54-year-old former journalist, was mulling declaring independence and calling so-called constituent elections for the newly-declared republic.

But Catalan foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told a news conference in Brussels: “Elections are not on the table now.”

As the threat of direct rule neared, the Catalan government took a combative tone.

“Giving in forms no part of this government’s scenarios,” spokesman Jordi Turull said on Tuesday. “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”

Tempers have flared since the jailing on Monday of two separatist leaders pending an investigation for alleged sedition.

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona’s Diagonal Avenue on Tuesday to call for their release, whistling and shouting “freedom” and “out with the occupying forces”.

Puigdemont said: “Sadly, we have political prisoners again,” referring to the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who suppressed Catalan culture and language until his death in 1975.",Spain asks Catalan leader to 'act sensibly' as direct rule deadline nears,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-rajoy/spain-asks-catalan-leader-to-act-sensibly-as-direct-rule-deadline-nears-idUKKBN1CN0VR

Take Nordstrom. With large insider stakes and growing revenue, the $6.7 billion department-store chain was a prime candidate for a buyout. Now it is shelving its sale until after the holidays. It may be hoping for a higher price. But the delay suggests even risk-tolerant buyers are cool on the sector.

Nordstrom’s family insiders – with roughly 30 percent of the company’s outstanding stock – said they were looking to take it private back in June. That didn’t seem far-fetched. Unlike Macy‘s, whose revenue has declined more than 8 percent in two years, Nordstrom’s top line is growing. Beefing up an online presence takes time and cash, and weathering the overall retail downturn would have been easier without the obligation of quarterly earnings.

The company’s books looked like they could withstand leverage too. If the family had rolled over its stake, they’d need roughly $1.6 billion of equity for a deal, Breakingviews calculates, assuming debt would be kept at a relatively modest four times 2018 EBITDA, or roughly $6.5 billion in total. Staples, which announced a buyout by private-equity firm Sycamore in June, was a much riskier proposition. The company’s revenue has fallen more than 7 percent over its last two fiscal years, and according to Eikon, analysts are expecting revenue to fall for the next three years.

That the Nordstroms weren’t able to team up with a partner – at least until after the holiday season – is troubling. And even if an impressive holiday season awaits, it may be hard to get other parties comfortable with the chain’s prospects. It didn’t help that Toys R Us, taken into private-equity ownership 12 years ago, filed for bankruptcy while the family was deliberating. On Monday, Target said that it was tendering for $2.2 billion of debt – a move that shows retailers are being more prudent with the balance sheets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street hit new records on strong earnings and the dollar extended a winning streak on Wednesday, boosted by rising Treasury yields as investors focused on monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury yields hit years-long highs and the difference in yield between U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasuries fell to the lowest since November 2007 as expectations for tighter global monetary policy pushed investors to sell shorter-dated Treasuries.

“The general tone from Fed speakers this week has been more on the hawkish side,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. “That and the global removal of accommodation is something markets have noticed.”

Rajappa said U.S. yields were rising in concert with European government bonds on expectations the European Central Bank, could signal a rollback of monetary stimulus on Thursday.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was boosted by strong earnings from heavyweight International Business Machines (IBM.N), which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average open above 23,000 for the first time.

“We’re in a sweet spot where the economy is growing not too strong and not too weak, the Fed’s tightening but not too rapidly, and earnings continue to expand. All the news is positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 121.94 points, or 0.53 percent, to 23,119.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.2 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,560.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.06 points, or 0 percent, to 6,623.72.

Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.3447 percent, from 2.298 percent late on Tuesday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 32/32 in price to yield 2.8531 percent, from 2.803 percent late on Tuesday.

In commodity markets, Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday and U.S. crude declined, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs boosted inventories of gasoline and diesel.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency urged Bangladesh on Tuesday to speed up vetting of up to 15,000 Rohingya refugees “stranded” near the border after crossing into the country from Myanmar and move them further inland to safer and better conditions.

Some 582,000 Rohingya are now known to have fled since violence erupted on Aug. 25 in northern Rakhine state, where they lack access to food and healthcare, U.N. officials said.

“We are gravely concerned about humanitarian conditions in Bangladesh, where thousands of new arrivals are stranded near the border,” UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a Geneva news briefing.

An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 have entered Bangladesh through the Anjuman Para border crossing point since Sunday night, many of whom described walking for about a week to reach the border, he said.

“We are advocating with the Bangladesh authorities to urgently admit these refugees fleeing violence and increasingly difficult conditions back home. Every minute counts given the fragile condition they are arriving in,” Mahecic said.

The delay was due to screening by Bangladesh border guards, he said, emphasizing this was the right of any government.

U.N. aid agencies have not had access to the shrinking Rohingya population in northern Rakhine state since the Aug. 25 coordinated insurgent attacks on police posts and army campaign which the U.N. rights office has likened to “ethnic cleansing”.

U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman wrapped up a five-day visit to Myanmar on Tuesday. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Feltman saw dozens of burned and destroyed villages in northern Rakhine.

Dujarric said that in Feltman’s discussions with the Myanmar military he “noted that, in the U.N.’s experience, successful counterterrorism efforts do not rely exclusively on security measures” and urged them to support “credible investigations into allegations of human rights abuses by security officials.”

Jens Laerke, spokesman of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said that Rohingya in Rakhine now faced a “desperate choice whether to stay or go”, not only due to the violence but also humanitarian needs.

Nearly 60 percent of the 582,000 refugees who have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25 are children – and thousands more are crossing each week, UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado said.

UNICEF, which is providing clean water every day to 40,000 people in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, and has installed thousands of toilets, may have to stop operations by the end of November unless further funds are received, she said.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China's 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place. (Graphics on 'China's leadership' - here)

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing’s cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Toxic fumes from kitchen drains forced the European Union on Wednesday to switch the venue of its summit in Brussels less than 24 hours before leaders were due to begin the two-day meeting.

The Europa Building, also known as “The Egg” and opened only in January amid controversy over its cost, was evacuated for the second time in a week on Wednesday after catering staff were taken ill due to fumes suspected to be leaking from the drains.

As a “precautionary measure”, the summit will now take place next door in the Justus Lipsius Building, an anonymous 1990s glass and stone-clad structure, which housed Europe’s councils until the opening of the 321-million-euro ($378 million) Europa.

The new building incorporates an exterior of jumbled salvaged window frames, a summit chamber painted a psychedelic patchwork, and an illuminated “lantern” containing several stories of offices that is visible from the street and known to locals as “Van Rompuy’s Egg” after the Belgian former summit chair.

About 20 kitchen staff were treated in hospital on Friday and an EU official said the Council and Belgian safety bodies were working on the assumption that Wednesday’s incident was due to the same source.

It was unclear how many staff were made ill on Wednesday.

Highlights of the summit are likely include an address by British Prime Minister Theresa May to the other 27 on her Brexit plans over dinner on Thursday and a statement to be agreed by the 27 on Friday that will demand London offer tens of billions of euros more on its withdrawal in 2019 if it wants to start negotiating a future relationship based on a free trade pact.",Egged off: EU summit venue switched after noxious fumes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-summit-fumes/egged-off-eu-summit-venue-switched-after-noxious-fumes-idUSKBN1CI2CZ?il=0

Rajoy issued his appeal in the national parliament, where he sought to win more political support for taking direct control of Catalonia on Thursday if the rebel regional government sticks to a plan to break away.

The move would need only a vote in Spain’s upper house, where Rajoy’s People’s Party holds an absolute majority.

It would be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that direct rule has been imposed.

A constitutional provision allows the central government to impose the law by giving orders to all branches of the regional authorities. Precisely how that would work in practical matters such as commanding the police force is untested.

Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers.

Many Spaniards fear the unprecedented step could lead to social unrest. The crisis has prompted hundreds of Catalan firms to move their headquarters, led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts and weighed on the euro.

In the latest grim prediction, Spain’s independent budget watchdog warned on Wednesday that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off the economy next year, reducing expected growth by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points.

Puigdemont has already defied Madrid once this week, reiterating on Monday an ambiguous independence declaration he made last week and immediately suspended.

“I ask Puigdemont to act sensibly, in a balanced way, to put the interests of all citizens first,” Rajoy said on Wednesday, mentioning both residents of the autonomous region, which produces a fifth of Spain’s wealth and has its own language and culture, and the rest of the country.

Thursday’s deadline is Puigdemont’s last chance to abandon an independence declaration which Madrid has rejected as illegal, and defuse Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

“It’s not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not we can talk here,” Rajoy said in parliament.

The row has rattled financial markets and sent companies scurrying to relocate on safer ground. Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, was considering moving its top management to Madrid.

Almost 700 companies pulled out of the northeastern region between Oct. 2 - the day after a referendum on independence which Madrid branded illegal - and Oct. 16, according to Spain’s companies registry.

Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centered on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday.

The region’s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter “if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months”, Exceltur said in a statement.

THREAT OF DIRECT RULE

Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that exactly what direct rule would look like is not clear, adding the government would work on it.

La Vanguardia said Puigdemont, a 54-year-old former journalist, was mulling declaring independence and calling so-called constituent elections for the newly-declared republic.

But Catalan foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told a news conference in Brussels: “Elections are not on the table now.”

As the threat of direct rule neared, the Catalan government took a combative tone.

“Giving in forms no part of this government’s scenarios,” spokesman Jordi Turull said on Tuesday. “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”

Tempers have flared since the jailing on Monday of two separatist leaders pending an investigation for alleged sedition.

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona’s Diagonal Avenue on Tuesday to call for their release, whistling and shouting “freedom” and “out with the occupying forces”.

Puigdemont said: “Sadly, we have political prisoners again,” referring to the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who suppressed Catalan culture and language until his death in 1975.",Spain asks Catalan leader to 'act sensibly' as direct rule deadline nears,https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-rajoy/spain-asks-catalan-leader-to-act-sensibly-as-direct-rule-deadline-nears-idINKBN1CN13D?il=0

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Doing the right thing is its own – and sometimes only – reward. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s hints that policy interest rates may soon rise can be justified by higher inflation. But he is in a no-win situation. The central banker will be criticised for hurting a slow-growing economy if he hikes and accused of playing fast and loose if he delays.

UK inflation is running a full percentage point above the central bank’s 2 percent target and has reached levels not seen since 2012, national statistics office data showed on Tuesday. True, the impact of past declines in sterling, triggered by last year’s vote to leave the European Union, should fade. But there are other good reasons why a majority of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee judged in September that policy rates might have to rise. Unemployment is at 4.3 percent, its lowest in more than four decades, suggesting there is little slack in the economy. Consumer debt is growing at nearly a double-digit clip.

Critics – including a majority of economists polled by Reuters – believe that raising rates from a record low of 0.25 percent would be an error on a par with that made by the European Central Bank when it raised rates during the financial crisis. They point out that the economy grew just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, the slowest rate of any Group of Seven industrial nation. Worse may be ahead if the UK struggles to agree a new trade deal with the European Union and falls out with its largest trading partner.

But political uncertainty will linger for a while. And the parallel with the ECB in 2008 is imperfect: the Bank kept policy very loose after the Brexit vote, and rates have been at record lows for many years. Carney’s least bad option may therefore be to tighten policy and rethink if the worst comes to pass. His life is unlikely to be much easier if he delays. UK lawmakers branded him an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014 after he shied away from an expected rate rise. In central banking, as elsewhere, mud sticks.","Breakingviews - Heads or tails, Mark Carney loses",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy-breakingviews/breakingviews-heads-or-tails-mark-carney-loses-idUSKBN1CM2D2

MARIBOR, Slovenia (Reuters) - Liverpool produced a superb attacking display to ignite their stuttering Champions League campaign with a blistering 7-0 Group E victory at Maribor on Tuesday.

Having drawn their opening two games, Liverpool made a dream start when Mohamed Salah burst into the box before squaring for Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino to stroke home in the fourth minute.

Nine minutes later Firmino’s compatriot Philippe Coutinho converted James Milner’s smart pullback to double the lead before Salah finished smartly at the near post as Liverpool ran riot in the opening 19 minutes.

Liverpool’s fluid, dynamic front three continued to cut loose and the effervescent Salah capped a stunning first half for the visitors, converting Alberto Moreno’s low cross to make it 4-0 in the 39th minute.

Halftime did little to halt their momentum and Firmino added a well-deserved second finishing from Coutinho’s fierce cross with a deft header in the 54th minute.

Substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with his first Liverpool goal, and Trent Alexander-Arnold completed the rout in the closing stages as the visitors registered their biggest win under manager Juergen Klopp.

REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s oil sands producers are stuck in a rut.

The nation’s oil firms are retrenching, with large producers planning little or no further expansion and some smaller projects struggling even to cover their operating costs.

As the era of large new projects comes to a close, many mid-sized producers - those with fewer assets and producing less than 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the oil sands - have shelved expansion plans, unable to earn back the high start-up costs with crude at around $50 per barrel. Larger Canadian producers, meanwhile, focus on projects that in the past were associated with smaller names.

The last three years have seen dozens of new projects mothballed and expansions put on hold, meaning millions of barrels of crude from the world’s third-largest reserves may never be extracted.

Where industry groups in 2014 expected Canada’s oil sands output to more than double to nearly 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, that forecast has been knocked down to 3.7 million bpd.

This follows a spell of consolidation that has seen foreign majors sell off more than $23 billion in Canadian assets in a year and turn to U.S. shale patches such as the Permian basin in Texas, which produce returns more quickly and where proximity to refiners means the barrels fetch a better price.

“We cannot compete with that huge sucking noise to the south that is called the Permian. Investment dollars are spiraling away down there,” Derek Evans, chief executive of small oil sands producer Pengrowth Energy (PGF.TO) told Reuters in an interview.

Permian production rose 21 percent in 12 months through July compared to a 9 percent increase in Alberta’s oil sands, according to Canadian and U.S. government data.

COSTLY STARTUP PHASE

Mid-sized producers are hurting the most, due to start-up costs that far exceed those in other major producing areas. Oil sands producers have slashed operating costs by a third since 2014, but building a new thermal project - in which steam is pumped as deep as one kilometer (1094 yards)underground to liquefy tar-like bitumen and bring it to the surface - requires U.S. crude benchmark at around $60 a barrel to break even, analysts estimate.

The North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 has traded between $42 and $55 a barrel so far this year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts it will average $49.69 a barrel in 2017 and $50.57 a barrel next year.

There are around half a dozen thermal projects in the costly start-up phase, when engineers steadily increase steam pressure to bring a reservoir’s production up to full capacity.

One of those is Athabasca Oil Corp’s (ATH.TO) Hangingstone project. It was originally conceived as a 80,000 bpd project, but instead will bring output to only 12,000 bpd from the current 9,000 bpd. The project can break even with U.S. crude prices of at least $53 a barrel, meaning right now Athabasca keeps losing money on Hangingstone production. Size is crucial in the oil sands; the more bitumen a company can squeeze out of a plant, the lower fixed costs per barrel will be.

“(Athabasca) was a company built when oil was $100 a barrel. In those days we were going to find funding for joint ventures and build greenfield projects to a massive size. The reality is the world changed,” chief executive Rob Broen told Reuters.

Quarterly filings show why smaller players are struggling. Transportation and marketing costs at Hangingstone, along with the cost of natural gas used to produce steam to extract oil, and other operating costs are much higher compared with Cenovus Energy’s (CVE.TO) Christina Lake project, one of the highest-quality and biggest bitumen reservoirs in the oil sands.

Pengrowth’s development plans are on hold as well, Evans said, because the company needs U.S. crude to stay at $55 for a sustained period to justify investment in its 14,000 bpd Lindbergh thermal project, at one point intended to grow as large as 40,000 bpd.

THE BIG GO SMALL

Large producers have pulled back in response to lower global prices as well. For example, Suncor Energy’s (SU.TO) 194,000 bpd Fort Hills mine, due to start producing oil by the end of this year, is the company’s last megaproject.

Canadian Natural (CNQ.TO) restarted construction on its 40,000 bpd Kirby North project last November, one of a handful of smaller projects to start producing in 2019.

Other companies like MEG Energy (MEG.TO) are planning expansions at existing sites in 20,000 bpd “modules” rather than starting large new projects from scratch. But even such more modest investments are out of reach for smaller companies like Athabasca and Pengrowth.

“It’s very hard (for a small company) to drag itself out of the financing black hole it would have to get in to build a project to start with,” said Nick Lupick, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital. “A large company can take that on their balance sheet without having to leverage too highly.”","Canada's oil sands survive, but can't thrive in a $50 oil world",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CN0FD-OCABS

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

In a deal announced last month, Allergan transferred the Restasis patents to New York state’s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, claiming the group’s status as a sovereign nation meant the patents could not be reviewed by the U.S. patent office.

Allergan said the move was justified because the same patents were already being reviewed in federal court, but critics said it was a cynical attempt to prolong the company’s monopoly on Restasis.

The federal judge, William Bryson, expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the tribal transfer, calling it a ploy by Allergan to “rent” the tribe’s sovereign immunity.

He did not rule directly on whether the transfer was legal, however, because that question was not squarely before him. But his decision on Monday rendered Allergan’s move largely meaningless, since he invalidated the Restasis patents himself instead of waiting for the patent office to rule.

Allergan said it was disappointed by Bryson’s decision to invalidate the patents and vowed to appeal.

Legal experts said the rebuke from a prominent judge will make other patent owners reluctant to copy Allergan’s maneuver.

“This should flash some serious yellow lights, if not red lights, in front of parties considering a deal like this,” said Michael Carrier, a professor of patent law at Rutgers Law School.

PR BACKLASH

The dispute over the Restasis patents dates back to 2015 when generic drug companies led by Mylan NV (MYL.O) asked a federal judge sitting in Texas to invalidate Allergan’s Restasis patents in hopes of launching their own generic versions of the medicine.

The generic drugmakers also asked the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), an administrative court run by the patent office, to revoke the patents. Companies often ask both a federal judge and PTAB to cancel patents.

Allergan said in September that it had transferred its Restasis patents to the tribe, which agreed to license the patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments.

The company said the PTAB proceeding should be terminated because the tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the tribe. Allergan said it wanted to avoid defending the patent in both federal court and before PTAB.

But after Bryson’s ruling, other patent owners will be less likely to transfer such patents to tribes to shield them from review, said Rachel Sachs, a professor of patent law at Washington University in St. Louis.

Bryson said “sovereign immunity should not be treated as a monetizable commodity that can be purchased by private entities as part of a scheme to evade their legal responsibilities.”

Sachs said Bryson is a well-regarded judge and that his reasoning could be cited by other courts, including PTAB judges.

She noted the ruling comes after weeks of criticism on Capitol Hill, where politicians have slammed Allergan’s move as a sham, with one U.S. senator introducing a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty. [nL2N1MG26D]

In a research note on Monday, analysts at Credit Suisse said Allergan suffered a “public relations backlash” from the deal without helping its bottom line.

Allergan said in a statement on Tuesday that its deal with the tribe has helped raised awareness about the need to reform the PTAB process, which the company said does not provide due process to patent owners.

Some legal experts said it is too early to declare Allergan’s patent gambit a failure.

Jacob Sherkow, a professor of patent law at New York Law School, said PTAB may still rule in favor of Allergan on its sovereign immunity defense.

If that happens, Allergan’s deal with the tribe could be copied by other patent owners, said Joshua Landau, a patent lawyer with the trade group Computer & Communications Industry Association.

Bryson’s decision “will make patent owners question the arrangement, but I don’t know if the ruling will prevent it entirely,” Landau said.",Allergan ruling casts doubt on tribal patent strategy,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-patents-analysis/allergan-ruling-casts-doubt-on-tribal-patent-strategy-idUSKBN1CM369?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

RAQQA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kurdish groups who led the fight against Islamic State in its former capital Raqqa must navigate a complex peace to avoid ethnic tension with the city’s Arab majority and to secure critical U.S. aid.

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which finally vanquished Islamic State in Raqqa on Tuesday face a big task rebuilding a city left in ruins by months of intense fighting and heavy air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition.

The political challenge is no less daunting in a city that falls outside the Kurdish-dominated regions of northern Syria.

The fall of Raqqa, where Islamic State staged euphoric parades after its string of lightning victories in 2014, is a potent symbol of the jihadist movement’s collapsing fortunes.

Its self-declared “caliphate” is also crumbling fast in eastern Syria, helping President Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies to recapture swathes of territory.

Keenly aware of Raqqa’s ethnic and tribal sensitivities, the SDF has been working hard to put Arabs at the heart of plans for local government and policing post-Islamic State, analysts say.

In the short term, the Raqqa Civil Council (RCC) set up under SDF auspices must urgently provide security, repair infrastructure and supply aid to win the backing of a population exhausted by conflict, and to allow the people of Raqqa to return home.

Longer term, Raqqa’s political destiny is tied to the wider fate of the war that has shattered Syria into a patchwork of areas over the last six years, including swathes of the north controlled by the Kurdish YPG militia that leads the SDF.

Ultimately, the Syrian state wants to recover control of this city on the Euphrates River, meaning it may eventually become the arena of a new conflict with Damascus, or a bargaining chip in eventual negotiations over possible Kurdish autonomy.

“Whoever leads us, Kurd or Arab, we want them to provide us with services,” said a man from Raqqa, speaking outside the RCC headquarters in Ain Issa, north of the city.

“Safety and security is the most important thing,” said the man, a government employee before the war who cited lingering fear of the Syrian state as his reason for staying anonymous.

“FEDERAL” FUTURE?

Raqqa was not a target for the YPG earlier in the war but gradually became one as the militia emerged as the main Syrian partner for the U.S.-led coalition.

The U.S.-led coalition says Arab fighters battling under the SDF banner made up the bulk of the force in the Raqqa campaign. But Kurdish commanders and fighters of the well-organised YPG appeared the leading force throughout the four-month campaign.

Syria’s main Kurdish party, the PYD, and its allies may hope Raqqa will eventually join a new “federal” system of autonomous regions they are establishing in the north.

But Kurdish leaders say it is too early to discuss that for now, underlining local and international sensitivities surrounding the political project opposed by their U.S. allies and neighbouring Turkey.

While Syrian Kurds say they want to remain part of Syria, regional concern over Kurdish separatism has deepened since Iraqi Kurds voted for independence, triggering military action by Iraq and tough measures by Turkey and Iran.

Turkey, in particular, views rising Syrian Kurdish power at its border as a threat to its security, and unsuccessfully pressed Washington to abandon its alliance with the YPG in the run up to the Raqqa attack.

Turkey plays host to a rival Raqqa civil council which regards the YPG as a foreign occupation force. Kurdish politicians say Raqqa’s future is now entirely in the hands of its people.

“So far we have not seen any reactions to indicate there will not be acceptance of the SDF, or the RCC,” said Fawza Youssef, a senior Kurdish politician, in an interview.

“The ones who will remain in Raqqa will be the internal security forces and the RCC,” she said. “The security forces that are being prepared are all volunteers from Raqqa.”

Some YPG fighters quickly began pulling back from the city on Tuesday, handing their positions to non-Kurdish elements of the SDF, a witness and field commanders said.

RISK OF “COVERT INTERFERENCE”

The SDF applied a similar model in the northern Syrian city of Manbij last year after capturing it from Islamic State.

“The (RCC) is still closely linked with YPG/PYD power structures, but they have put more time and effort into emphasising inclusivity than we have seen in some other areas,” senior International Crisis Group analyst Noah Bonsey said.

But the risk of unrest would rise if Kurdish groups were perceived to be micro-managing the city.

“There is also the risk of covert interference from the outside: IS sleeper cells, and the Syrian regime may see an interest in using loyalist networks to destabilise things. Either of those dynamics could heighten ethnic tension.”

Yasser al-Sayyed, a 43-year-old former car salesman from Raqqa, said people are “happy with the SDF now, of course, because they’re free from Daesh (Islamic State)”. “But this needs to be followed up” with aid, reconstruction and jobs.

The United States has deployed a team of diplomats to Syria to work on humanitarian and stabilisation efforts.

The U.S. State Department said Washington would take the lead in helping to clear rubble and restore basic services.

“We will assist and take, essentially, the lead in bringing back the water, electricity and all of that,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing. “But eventually the governance of the country of Syria is something that I think all nations remain very interested in.”

But analysts question how long U.S. support will last.

A U.S. official involved in post-Raqqa planning said support could not be channelled to a “PYD political project of expansion into this part of the country”, and the United States would not support “the PYD project to make an autonomous administration”.

For example, the official said schools could only get aid if they were teaching a variant of the Syrian state curriculum, rather than an entirely new one. “We’re not going to support a separatist entity ... that’s cut and dry,” the official said.

Though McGurk said nobody living in SDF-held areas wanted a return of Syrian state control, Damascus may be planning to reassert its influence.

A Syrian government official forecast trouble ahead for the SDF in Raqqa and other Arab majority areas of Syria.

“There is a contradiction,” said one Syrian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The manpower is with the Arabs, but the military power is with the Kurds.”","Analysis: After victory in Raqqa over IS, Kurds face tricky peace",https://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-raqqa-usa-analysis/analysis-after-victory-in-raqqa-over-is-kurds-face-tricky-peace-idINKBN1CM3AZ

LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Theresa May will make a pitch to fellow EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday as she tries to break a deadlock in Brexit talks that has left Britain’s future trading position up in the air.

But EU officials expect no movement in negotiating positions from either side before the other 27 leaders deliver a verdict on progress on Friday that will say Britain must up its offer on divorce terms before they will even talk about trade.

“We do not expect at this stage any new initiatives between now and the European Council,” said an EU official, who said May had asked to address the summit.

The others will not negotiate with her but will discuss Brexit after May leaves on Friday.

They plan to reject her call for an immediate start to talks on a future trade relationship but make a “gesture” recognizing the concessions May offered in a speech at Florence last month by telling EU staff to prepare for talks on a transition period.

Stepping personally into the breach after Brexit Secretary David Davis’s four months of discussions struck deadlock last week, May had dinner in Brussels on Monday with EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and his negotiator Michel Barnier.

But she came away with just a joint pledge to “accelerate” the process.

There is a catch: the EU will not discuss relations in the future until London agrees to pay tens of billions of euros (dollars) in a divorce settlement for obligations incurred in the past. May, beset by demands from hardline Brexit supporters to simply walk away without any deal, says the bill can be worked out only when the future relationship is clearer.

“It takes two to accelerate,” Barnier told reporters as he arrived to brief EU ministers in Luxembourg. “One step after another... We are not finished with the first step.”

May’s spokesman said she was pleased with a dinner that ended with an embrace at the door from Juncker. But he added: “We can only resolve the financial implications of the UK’s withdrawal ... as part of the settlement of all the issues.”

MERKEL-MACRON FRONT

May came away similarly empty-handed from telephone calls to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, leaders of the Union’s leading powers whose diplomats have taken a hard line this month in limiting the scope of the gesture on transition preparations which Barnier had proposed.

People familiar with those calls on Sunday and Monday said May echoed emotional complaints from British negotiators last week that her Florence speech, offering to “honor commitments” made by Britain, deserved a more generous response from the EU.

Macron and Merkel, who are coordinating closely, were clear that they will negotiate at the stage only through Barnier, a former French foreign minister, officials said.

And they insisted Britain settled outstanding issues first, despite increasingly vocal calls from business on both sides of the English Channel for clarity by early next year at the latest in order to plan investments for after Brexit in March 2019.

BusinessEurope, which represents employers federations across the continent including Britain’s CBI, was the latest, saying it was “extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations” and telling EU summit chair Donald Tusk in a letter that “business wants to avoid a cliff edge”.

EU leaders plan to issue a statement after May leaves on Friday saying that they hope a deal can be struck at their next summit in December and that things can move swiftly then.

But after losing her majority in June, May has little room for maneuver at home: “It’s all about the money and if she ups the bid now, that is a really hard sell politically,” a senior source in her Conservative Party told Reuters.

British efforts to remind continental neighbors of how much they also have to lose if trade is disrupted are showing little return, even among close trading partners with most at stake.

“Sometimes it’s very difficult to see and understand what Britain really wants from these negotiations,” Finnish minister Samuli Virtanen said.

Brexit minister Davis, who long campaigned to take Britain out of the EU, said London had no plan to walk away from talks but should maintain the option in negotiations. Yet interior minister Amber Rudd, who opposed Brexit in the referendum, said shortly afterward that it was “unthinkable” that the two sides would fail to strike a deal as it was in their own interests.",May to pitch on Brexit at EU summit dinner,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CM2O5

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell to a one-year low in September as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted the construction of single-family homes in the South, suggesting housing probably remained a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.

The report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department also showed a decline in building permits, raising concerns that the housing market recovery was stalling. Homebuilding and sales are well below their peaks before the housing bubble burst in 2006.

“Residential construction should be a hefty drag on third-quarter GDP growth,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “Housing activity has shifted from leading the economic expansion to now just following it, at best.”

Housing starts decreased 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.127 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the lowest level since September 2016 and marked the third monthly decline in starts.

Groundbreaking tumbled 9.3 percent in the South to the lowest level since October 2015, with single-family homebuilding in the region plunging 15.3 percent to more than a one-year low. The South, which was pummeled by Harvey and Irma, accounts for almost half of the nation’s homebuilding.

Building permits fell 4.5 percent to a rate of 1.215 million units in September. Permits in the South dropped 5.6 percent. The Commerce Department said the areas in Texas and Florida impacted by the storms accounted for about 13 percent of U.S. building permits in 2016.

“September’s drop in starts underscores the importance of Florida and Houston,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a rate of 1.175 million units last month and building permits slipping to a rate of 1.250 million units.

The PHLX index of housing stocks .HGX was flat, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market, and shares in the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI.N), fell 0.4 percent.

The dollar .DXY rose marginally against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasuries fell.

LABOR SHORTAGES LOOM Even before the storms struck, residential construction had almost stagnated this year amid shortages of land and skilled labor as well as rising costs of building materials.

Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 7.3 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the steepest drop in nearly seven years. As a result, housing subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from gross domestic product in the April-June quarter.

Housing market fundamentals, however, still remain solid.

Unemployment is at more than a 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent, wages are rising steadily and mortgage rates remain close to historic lows. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house rose 4 percent last week from a week earlier.

Economists expect housing starts to rebound in the fourth quarter, but they caution that rebuilding in the areas devastated by the hurricanes could pull scarce labor away from other parts of the country and limit gains. The reconstruction effort is also pushing up prices of building materials.

Rebuilding after fires destroyed homes in parts of California was also expected to worsen labor shortages and drive up the cost of materials. A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rising to a five-month high in October, though concerns about labor and land shortages lingered.

Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.6 percent to a rate of 829,000 units in September. That was the lowest level since May.

Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since vaulting to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Single-family starts rose in the Northeast and Midwest last month and hit more than a 10-year high in the West.

Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment fell 5.1 percent to a rate of 298,000 units.

Single-family home permits rose 2.4 percent. Permits, however, continued to lag starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding will probably not rebound strongly.

Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 16.1 percent. Despite the drop, permits continued to outpace starts, a positive sign for future multi-family construction.

“We expect starts and permits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year before rebounding strongly with the spring selling season in early 2018,” said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs and an unexpected increase in inventories of gasoline and diesel.

Prices had been higher due to ongoing tensions around oil-rich Iraq and Iran, which raised risk premiums.

International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell two cents to $57.86 a barrel as of 11:18 a.m. EDT (1518 GMT). They reached their highest in three weeks earlier in the session at $58.54 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 11 cents to $51.77 a barrel.

Weekly U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding expectations. [EIA/S]

Refiners throttled down activity as the fall maintenance season got underway, and overall refining runs fell off. In addition, inventories of gasoline and diesel rose, the latter unexpectedly, reviving some concerns about elevated inventories during a time when demand for petroleum products declines.

The dropoff of 4.7 percentage points took refining output to 84.5 percent of capacity, representing the seasonally slowest rate of output since 2011.

“A setback in refinery utilization rates occurred as refiners undergo seasonal maintenance,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “Builds in refined products and a setback in refined product demand provides weight to the energy complex.”

The market has been buoyant of late due to developments in the Middle East, where tensions in northern Iraq threatened to disrupt oil flows through a key pipeline from Iraq to Turkey.

Crude flows through the 600,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Kurdish pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have dropped off sharply to around 225,000 bpd, a shipping source told Reuters.

“It remains to be seen whether the Kurds, after withdrawing from the region they claim to be entitled to, will allow crude oil to be transported by pipeline across their territory to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan,” said analysts at Commerzbank.

The Iraq crisis represents one of two notable Middle Eastern threats to oil supply, along with the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran’s compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide on further action against Tehran.

During the previous round of sanctions against Iran, some 1 million barrels per day of oil was cut from global markets.

More than one month ahead of OPEC’s next official meeting, sources told Reuters its members were leaning toward extending an oil supply cut deal struck with Russia and other producers for a further nine months.

Three OPEC sources said keeping the curbs in place until the end of 2018 was a likely outcome, while a fourth said an extension of six to nine months would be needed to remove all excess oil in storage.

A technical pattern known as a “Golden Cross” was approaching in WTI crude oil contracts on Wednesday, in which the 50-day moving average climbs higher than the 200-day. This is widely seen as a bullish price indicator, and already occurred with Brent futures on Sept. 25.","Oil slips from earlier gains as U.S. gasoline, diesel stocks rise",https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-slips-from-earlier-gains-as-u-s-gasoline-diesel-stocks-rise-idINKBN1CM0LS?il=0

The bemused bovine and camera-wielding humans stared at each other through a chain-link fence for several minutes, according to live news video.

At other times the beast wandered curiously around the 526-acre (212-acre) Prospect Park, the largest in the borough of Brooklyn, and the artificial turf field normally used for human sporting events.

Officers used soccer goals to fence the animal in on a baseball diamond, but the cow barreled through one of the nets, knocking down a police officer.

Police eventually trapped the cow between two vehicles parked on either side of baseball field’s bench area after an officer appeared to fire a tranquilizer dart at it.

Officers then seemed content to let the cow roam between cars, waiting for the drug to take effect before they were able to rope the beast and load it into an NYPD horse trailer.

It was not clear where the beast came from or how it got lost. Police said they would turn it over to the animal control department after they caught it.

The chase drew torrents of posts on social media, many featuring groan-inducing puns.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday.

China will push ahead with market-oriented reforms of its foreign exchange rate as well as its financial system, and let the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, Xi said at the opening of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress.

“China’s open door will not be closed, it will be only be opened wider,” Xi said.

The government will “clean up rules and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition, support development of private firms and stimulate vitality of all types of market entities,” Xi said, while pledging to further open China’s services sector to foreign investors.

However, while expressing support for market reform and private firms, Xi also called for stronger, bigger state firms.

The government will “promote strengthening, improvement and expansion of state capital, (and) effectively prevent loss of state assets, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises, development a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms,” Xi said.

Xi’s comments reiterated a long-standing pledge by party leaders to give a greater role to free-market forces to improve efficiency and put the economy on a more sustainable growth path.

But as Xi gears up for his second five-year term, foreign business executives and analysts increasingly believe market liberalization is seen as secondary to his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability.

Other painful reforms that many economists say are needed have also moved slowly under Xi. They include overhauling China’s bloated and debt-laden state sector, fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt and bringing in new property taxes to ward off housing bubbles.

LOWER GROWTH TARGETS?

China should also strengthen consumption as a foundation for economic development, Xi said, and will expand the middle class and narrow the gap in development between rural and urban areas.

Beijing’s campaign to rein in high debt levels and industrial overcapacity will continue as part of supply-side structural reforms, he added.

Xi also proposed a goal of developing China into a “basically” modernized, innovation-driven country by 2035 and a modern “strong power” by 2050.

But analysts said that suggests the government is likely to continue to target moderately high economic growth in coming years, which could see the country’s large debt pile climb even further.

China’s gross domestic income per capita would need to rise by an average of 6.6 percent a year in real U.S. dollar terms from 2017 onwards to become an “innovative economy” and match the development level of today’s South Korea by 2035, ANZ estimated.

That growth figure needs to be no lower than 4.9 percent for China to be a “modernized economy” - the by World Bank’s definition of high income countries - all the way to 2050, ANZ added.

“Nobody knows what is a ‘modernized country’, but from the wording of Xi Jinping you can tell what he would like to achieve is for China to be one of the high income countries today like Japan and Australia,” said Raymond Yeung, Great China Chief Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.

China is expected to post its strongest economic growth in several years this year, riding on a government-led construction boom, but economists said it is still relying too heavily on credit-fueled stimulus despite policymakers’ vows to reduce debt risks.

Some international agencies and economists have argued Beijing should abandon its arbitrary annual growth targets or lower it to become less reliant on government stimulus and bank credit. Less ambitious growth targets would also give policymakers more room for tougher reforms.

Specific economic targets for 2018 are likely to be set during an economic work meeting later this year, but are not expected to be announced until March.

The International Monetary Fund warned this year that China’s credit growth was on a “dangerous trajectory” and called for “decisive action”, while the Bank for International Settlements said in late 2016 that excessive debt growth was signaling a banking crisis in the next three years.

Hochtief is offering 18.76 euros in cash, or 0.1281 Hochtief shares, for each Abertis share and has set a minimum acceptance threshold of 50 percent plus one share.

Builder ACS is launching the bid via cash-positive Hochtief to protect its credit rating and avoid having to raise equity itself, though Hochtief’s plan to issue up to 24.8 million shares would dilute ACS’s 72 percent stake in the German firm.

The move creates a dilemma for Abertis, which has also received a cash and shares offer from Atlantia worth around 15.7 billion euros on a comparable basis, according to analysts.

A tie-up between Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, and Abertis would create the world’s biggest toll-roads operator and help both companies in their drive to branch out from their home markets.

However, a source close to ACS - whose chairman Florentino Perez also heads Real Madrid soccer club - has told Reuters that its bid has the backing of the Spanish government, which may be reluctant to see Abertis’s politically sensitive motorways concessions in Spain fall into foreign hands.

A previous deal between Atlantia and Abertis fell through in 2006 due to opposition from the Italian government.

Atlantia launched its cash and shares bid in May, and people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week it was prepared to raise it if ACS - as expected - triggered a takeover battle.

“Hochtief’s offer is very competitive, but we would expect Atlantia to fight for Abertis as this is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” a Milan-based trader said.

At 1430 GMT, Abertis shares were up 7.1 percent at 18.89 euros. ACS’s were up 4.6 percent at 32.88 euros, Hochtief’s up 2.5 percent at 153.3 euros and Atlantia’s down 1.4 percent at 26.86 euros.

ON HOLD

Hochtief said Abertis would complement its business by adding the operation and maintenance of infrastructure to its developing and building operations, allowing it to “generate value throughout the entire infrastructure project life cycle.”

Hochtief has secured financing of 15 billion euros at a 2 percent interest rate and is planning to pay out up to 90 percent of its profit to shareholders after a successful Abertis bid, it said.

Atlantia’s bid has cleared all regulators and, according to two Italian sources, has the non-binding backing of investors representing more than 50 percent of Abertis’s capital.

But one of the sources said Abertis’ top investor, Criteria Caixa - the financial arm of a politically connected and powerful banking foundation - had not committed to taking up Atlantia’s offer. Criteria has a 22.3 percent stake in Abertis.

Hochtief’s bid puts Atlantia’s offer, which began on Oct. 10 and was due to run through Oct. 24, on hold. Spanish market watchdog CNMV now has to examine Hochtief’s offer and decide whether it can go ahead.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).
This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.
The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.
“It wouldn’t make sense for people to boil their tap water to recover gold or silver because it has already been filtered out before it re-enters the drinking water supply,” Vriens said.","ZURICH (Reuters) - While London’s sewers can get clogged with fatbergs made up of grease and diapers, it seems Switzerland’s waste system is flecked with silver and gold.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).

But before people start hunting in their drains for jewelry, the government study said the tiny particles were likely to be mostly from the watchmaking, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, which use the metals in their products and processes.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

The Swiss metal concentrations complied with regulations and were removed before humans drank the water again, the study said.

(Reuters) - New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge delivered once again with a home run that paved the way for a come-from-behind 6-4 win over the Houston Astros on Tuesday, squaring their best-of-seven American League Championship Series at 2-2.

With the Yankees trailing 4-0 in the seventh inning, the 6-foot 7-inch (201 cm) slugger sent a towering solo home run more than 400 feet over centerfield.

That one mighty hit from Judge, who hit a three-run homer and made two outstanding catches in Monday’s 8-1 win over the Astros, ignited a subdued Yankee Stadium crowd and seemed to give the team belief.

The 25-year-old delivered an encore by tying the game with a double in the eighth before the Yankees went on to take the victory and even the series.

“It’s pretty surreal to be honest,” Judge told reporters.

“I’ve been in that situation in my head a thousand times, game on the line, but the dream’s not the same as reality, being out there with that crowd and that atmosphere.”

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant.
If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response.
The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas.
The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico.","It seems there’s a template that critics follow for Donald Trump versus the Hurricanes: they say he won’t do enough, that it isn’t being done fast enough, that everything will collapse (ready Katrina headlines) and then the draining, heroic reality of the response takes hold. With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs and an unexpected increase in inventories of gasoline and diesel.

Prices had been higher due to ongoing tensions around oil-rich Iraq and Iran, which raised risk premiums.

International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell two cents to $57.86 a barrel as of 11:18 a.m. EDT (1518 GMT). They reached their highest in three weeks earlier in the session at $58.54 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 11 cents to $51.77 a barrel.

Weekly U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding expectations. [EIA/S]

Refiners throttled down activity as the fall maintenance season got underway, and overall refining runs fell off. In addition, inventories of gasoline and diesel rose, the latter unexpectedly, reviving some concerns about elevated inventories during a time when demand for petroleum products declines.

The dropoff of 4.7 percentage points took refining output to 84.5 percent of capacity, representing the seasonally slowest rate of output since 2011.

“A setback in refinery utilization rates occurred as refiners undergo seasonal maintenance,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “Builds in refined products and a setback in refined product demand provides weight to the energy complex.”

The market has been buoyant of late due to developments in the Middle East, where tensions in northern Iraq threatened to disrupt oil flows through a key pipeline from Iraq to Turkey.

Crude flows through the 600,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Kurdish pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have dropped off sharply to around 225,000 bpd, a shipping source told Reuters.

“It remains to be seen whether the Kurds, after withdrawing from the region they claim to be entitled to, will allow crude oil to be transported by pipeline across their territory to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan,” said analysts at Commerzbank.

The Iraq crisis represents one of two notable Middle Eastern threats to oil supply, along with the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran’s compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide on further action against Tehran.

During the previous round of sanctions against Iran, some 1 million barrels per day of oil was cut from global markets.

More than one month ahead of OPEC’s next official meeting, sources told Reuters its members were leaning toward extending an oil supply cut deal struck with Russia and other producers for a further nine months.

Three OPEC sources said keeping the curbs in place until the end of 2018 was a likely outcome, while a fourth said an extension of six to nine months would be needed to remove all excess oil in storage.

A technical pattern known as a “Golden Cross” was approaching in WTI crude oil contracts on Wednesday, in which the 50-day moving average climbs higher than the 200-day. This is widely seen as a bullish price indicator, and already occurred with Brent futures on Sept. 25.","Oil slips from earlier gains as U.S. gasoline, diesel stocks rise",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-slips-from-earlier-gains-as-u-s-gasoline-diesel-stocks-rise-idINKBN1CN05M?il=0

U.S. and UK regulators now say it came clean about the real, diminished value of the mine too late. The second type of problem is less likely to recur. Rio has settled one case already and, in any event, the accounting rules for writing down badly priced acquisitions are relatively clear. If only there were similar safeguards against mining bosses getting carried away with deals in the first place.

Tom Albanese, who was the boss of Rio Tinto six years ago, paid $3.7 billion for Riversdale Mining. That was around three-quarters more than the price at which it had been trading in September 2010. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said on Oct. 17 that the board felt the premium was justified, even though internal reports had warned that this may not be the case. The problems turned out to be twofold: the mine had less recoverable coal than Rio thought, and its plan to ship the stuff out on barges proved unrealistic. The inevitable writedown came in January 2013.

When to write down the value of a business is subjective, but not entirely so. Accounting rules oblige businesses to look regularly for signs that an asset’s worth may have changed. In Rio’s case, the UK regulator says that those warnings didn’t reach the audit committee. Where the U.S. regulator sees fraud, its British peer sees poor judgement. Regardless, there was a strong incentive at the time to wait and see whether a writedown would be necessary. Albanese had already presided over huge writedowns from the poorly timed acquisition of aluminium miner Alcan.

Albanese and his then-finance director have gone, but the incentive to get carried away with the resources cycle hasn’t. Company bosses, often former miners, usually want to dig more rather than less. Governments in resource-rich frontier markets remain unpredictable. And miners’ debt levels have come down, giving them more firepower. Acquisitions in the mining sector almost doubled in the first half of 2017 compared with a year earlier, consultancy EY says. So yes, mining bosses should follow accounting rules.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

Workers repair electrical installations after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in San Juan, Puerto Rico, September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Alvin Baez

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Debris and destruction left by Hurricane Maria in Canovanas, Puerto Rico September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday declined to name China as a currency manipulator although it remained critical of the Chinese government’s economic policies ahead of a planned visit to Beijing by President Donald Trump.

The semi-annual U.S. Treasury currency report said no countries deserved the currency manipulator label, but it kept China on a currency “monitoring list” despite a fall in China’s global current account surplus since 2016. China’s currency, the renminbi or yuan, also has strengthened sharply against the dollar this year, reversing three straight years of weakening.

The Treasury cited China’s unusually large, bilateral trade surplus with the United States.

“Treasury remains concerned by the lack of progress made in reducing the bilateral trade surplus,” the department said in the report. “China continues to pursue a wide array of policies that limit market access for imported goods and services.”

The U.S.-China trade deficit stood at $34.9 billion in August, near a two-year high.

Four other trading partners which were on the monitoring list in April - Japan, South Korea, Germany and Switzerland - remained on the list. The administration said it was removing Taiwan from the list because it had reduced the scale of its foreign exchange interventions.

Deputy governor Ching-Long Yang said Taiwan’s central bank will continue the currency dialogue with Washington.

South Korea’s finance ministry official in charge of currency markets said Washington’s decision was as expected, noting the shrinking trade surplus with the United States helped his country avoid the “currency manipulator” label.

“Currency markets should be market-oriented, and we conduct smoothing operations only in cases of sharp volatility,” Kim Yoon-kyung, director general at the ministry’s International Finance Bureau, told Reuters by phone.

STRONGER YUAN

Trump, who on the campaign trail blamed China for “stealing” U.S. jobs and prosperity by cheapening its currency, had repeatedly promised to label the country as a currency manipulator on “day one” of a Trump administration - a move that would trigger special negotiations and could lead to punitive duties and other action.

But the president’s comments on China have been less harsh since he took office in January. Trump has said he would like Beijing’s help in pressuring North Korea to abandon a nuclear weapons program, and plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on a trip to Beijing in November.

Currency market analysts by and large had not expected the Trump administration to take a hard line on the currency issue now in the context of the North Korea tensions.

“There’s a necessity for the best possible cooperation we can get out of China on the North Korea issue, and labeling them a currency manipulator is probably not the best way to go about that,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at Worldwide Markets in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey.“In addition, there are very specific criteria at the Treasury for labeling someone a currency manipulator and over the past year and a half China simply does not fit those categories.”

As in its previous report on currencies in April, the Treasury criticized China’s past efforts to hold down the yuan’s value. But it said more recent efforts by Beijing to prevent a sudden depreciation of the yuan had probably helped the United States.

“A disorderly currency depreciation ... would have had negative consequences for the United States, China and the global economy,” the Treasury said.

In fact, after three years of depreciating against the dollar in which it weakened by more than 12 percent, the yuan this year has strengthened by nearly 5 percent. It was not yet trading following the report’s release but the offshore yuan was little changed against the dollar.

The Treasury did not alter its three major thresholds for identifying currency manipulation put in place last year by the Obama administration: a bilateral trade surplus with the United States of $20 billion or more; a global current account surplus of at least 3 percent of gross domestic product, and persistent foreign exchange purchases equal to 2 percent of GDP over 12 months.

No countries were determined to have met all three of these criteria. Treasury said a country would be put on the monitoring list if it met two of the criteria or if it accounted for a large and disproportionate share of the overall U.S. trade deficit. It also said countries put on the list would stay there for at least two consecutive currency reports “to help ensure that any improvement in performance versus the criteria is durable”.",Trump administration again declines to name China currency manipulator,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-currency/trump-administration-again-declines-to-name-china-currency-manipulator-idINKBN1CM30S

The EU withdrawal bill, which seeks largely to ‘copy and paste’ EU law into British legislation to ensure Britain has functioning laws and the same regulatory framework as the bloc at the moment of Brexit, is the next major hurdle for May.

Weakened by a June election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority and an ill-fated party conference that failed to reset her agenda, May wants to steer the bill through both houses of parliament with as little difficulty as possible.

But lawmakers have already proposed several amendments to the bill, including some to hand parliament a vote at the end of the negotiating process with the EU and others to reduce the amount of power the government gives itself to amend laws.

Asked whether the government was planning to introduce the legislation into the so-called committee phase of its lengthy passage towards the statute book in November, her spokesman told reporters: “We haven’t yet confirmed a date for the bill at the committee stage.”

“But the leader of the house will set out (next week’s business) tomorrow,” he added, referring to a weekly procedure when the government sets out its agenda, which may, or may not, include the EU withdrawal bill.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s opposition leader, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, returned home on Wednesday to a rapturous welcome from her supporters after more than three months away for medical treatment in Britain.

Bangladeshi politics has been mired for years in rivalry between Khaleda and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and Khaleda’s return could herald an increase in political activity in preparation for a general election due by the end of next year.

Both women are related to former national leaders, and they have alternated as prime minister for years.

In Khaleda’s absence, at least two arrest warrants were issued against her in connection with political turbulence and she was already on bail over several cases.

Her lawyers have dismissed the cases as harassment but a spokesman for her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Mohammad Shamsuddin, said she might appear in court on Thursday in connection with the cases.

Mohammad Shahidul Huq, inspector general of police, told reporters he had no instructions to arrest her.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein has resigned from the board of The Weinstein Company, it said on Tuesday, as he faces allegations that he sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women over three decades in the film business.

In a statement, the board said it also ratified its Oct. 8 decision to fire Weinstein as chief executive of the award-winning movie and television company he co-founded with his brother.

A source close to Weinstein confirmed that he had resigned from the board and had no further comment. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Also on Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp’s (7203.T) Lexus unit said it was evaluating its partnership with the Weinstein Co. Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand, is a sponsor of reality TV show “Project Runway,” which Weinstein Co produces.

“Lexus does not condone any acts of sexual harassment, assault or discrimination. In light of recent allegations involving Harvey Weinstein, we are currently evaluating our partnership with The Weinstein Company, but have nothing to announce at this time,” Lexus said in a statement.

A&E Television Networks, which airs “Project Runway” on its Lifetime cable channel, is also exploring its options for the show, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.

Weinstein’s executive producer credit and the Weinstein Co logo were removed from “Project Runway” last week.

A&E wants to be respectful of women who say they were harmed by Weinstein, the source said, and also is concerned about the livelihood of more than 200 cast and crew members who work on the series.

Weinstein Co is trying to chart a future without Weinstein, the aggressive dealmaker with a knack for managing Hollywood talent, money and egos. On Monday, it said it was in talks to sell the bulk of its assets to private equity firm Colony Capital.

One of Hollywood’s most influential forces since launching in October 2005, Weinstein Co has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.” Its television unit produces the long-running reality series “Project Runway.”

Harvey Weinstein is credited with conceiving the strategy that scored dozens of Oscar awards for the company’s films.

Hollywood trade publication Variety on Tuesday reported a separate harassment allegation against Bob Weinstein, Harvey’s younger brother and co-founder of Weinstein Co.

Bert Fields, an attorney for Bob Weinstein, said in a statement that the story was “false and misleading.”

REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s oil sands producers are stuck in a rut.

The nation’s oil firms are retrenching, with large producers planning little or no further expansion and some smaller projects struggling even to cover their operating costs.

As the era of large new projects comes to a close, many mid-sized producers - those with fewer assets and producing less than 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the oil sands - have shelved expansion plans, unable to earn back the high start-up costs with crude at around $50 per barrel. Larger Canadian producers, meanwhile, focus on projects that in the past were associated with smaller names.

The last three years have seen dozens of new projects mothballed and expansions put on hold, meaning millions of barrels of crude from the world’s third-largest reserves may never be extracted.

Where industry groups in 2014 expected Canada’s oil sands output to more than double to nearly 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, that forecast has been knocked down to 3.7 million bpd.

This follows a spell of consolidation that has seen foreign majors sell off more than $23 billion in Canadian assets in a year and turn to U.S. shale patches such as the Permian basin in Texas, which produce returns more quickly and where proximity to refiners means the barrels fetch a better price.

“We cannot compete with that huge sucking noise to the south that is called the Permian. Investment dollars are spiraling away down there,” Derek Evans, chief executive of small oil sands producer Pengrowth Energy (PGF.TO) told Reuters in an interview.

Permian production rose 21 percent in 12 months through July compared to a 9 percent increase in Alberta’s oil sands, according to Canadian and U.S. government data.

COSTLY STARTUP PHASE

Mid-sized producers are hurting the most, due to start-up costs that far exceed those in other major producing areas. Oil sands producers have slashed operating costs by a third since 2014, but building a new thermal project - in which steam is pumped as deep as one kilometer (1094 yards)underground to liquefy tar-like bitumen and bring it to the surface - requires U.S. crude benchmark at around $60 a barrel to break even, analysts estimate.

FILE PHOTO - Giant dump trucks haul raw tar sands at the Suncor tar sands mining operations near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada on September 17, 2014. REUTERS/Todd Korol/File Photo

The North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 has traded between $42 and $55 a barrel so far this year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts it will average $49.69 a barrel in 2017 and $50.57 a barrel next year.

There are around half a dozen thermal projects in the costly start-up phase, when engineers steadily increase steam pressure to bring a reservoir’s production up to full capacity.

One of those is Athabasca Oil Corp’s (ATH.TO) Hangingstone project. It was originally conceived as a 80,000 bpd project, but instead will bring output to only 12,000 bpd from the current 9,000 bpd. The project can break even with U.S. crude prices of at least $53 a barrel, meaning right now Athabasca keeps losing money on Hangingstone production. Size is crucial in the oil sands; the more bitumen a company can squeeze out of a plant, the lower fixed costs per barrel will be.

“(Athabasca) was a company built when oil was $100 a barrel. In those days we were going to find funding for joint ventures and build greenfield projects to a massive size. The reality is the world changed,” chief executive Rob Broen told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A Suncor refinery is seen in Sherwood Park, near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada November 13, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo

Quarterly filings show why smaller players are struggling. Transportation and marketing costs at Hangingstone, along with the cost of natural gas used to produce steam to extract oil, and other operating costs are much higher compared with Cenovus Energy’s (CVE.TO) Christina Lake project, one of the highest-quality and biggest bitumen reservoirs in the oil sands.

Pengrowth’s development plans are on hold as well, Evans said, because the company needs U.S. crude to stay at $55 for a sustained period to justify investment in its 14,000 bpd Lindbergh thermal project, at one point intended to grow as large as 40,000 bpd.

THE BIG GO SMALL

Large producers have pulled back in response to lower global prices as well. For example, Suncor Energy’s (SU.TO) 194,000 bpd Fort Hills mine, due to start producing oil by the end of this year, is the company’s last megaproject.

Canadian Natural (CNQ.TO) restarted construction on its 40,000 bpd Kirby North project last November, one of a handful of smaller projects to start producing in 2019.

Other companies like MEG Energy (MEG.TO) are planning expansions at existing sites in 20,000 bpd “modules” rather than starting large new projects from scratch. But even such more modest investments are out of reach for smaller companies like Athabasca and Pengrowth.

“It’s very hard (for a small company) to drag itself out of the financing black hole it would have to get in to build a project to start with,” said Nick Lupick, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital. “A large company can take that on their balance sheet without having to leverage too highly.”","Canada's oil sands survive, but can't thrive in a $50 oil world",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-oilsands-economics-analysis/canadas-oil-sands-survive-but-cant-thrive-in-a-50-oil-world-idUSKBN1CN0FD

When the scheme was first outlined in August, Brussels asked government for more details, expressing concern it may be a step backwards in the country’s fight against corruption.

The plan, also questioned by the president, magistrates and diplomats, was announced just six months after the Social Democrat-led (PSD) government attempted to weaken a crackdown on graft, triggering Romania’s largest street protests in decades.

Justice Minister Tudorel Toader gave no details of the new contents of the draft, but the original announcement included giving the minister control over the judicial inspection unit, currently managed by an independent magistrates’ watchdog (CSM).

Critics say that would mean the minister could put pressure on judges. More than 3,500 magistrates across the country have signed a petition, asking the minister to withdraw the plan.“The ministry has finalised the bill. We’ve written a request for an opinion from the Venice Commission ... there will also be a discussion with Frans Timmermans on Oct. 26,” Justice Minister Tudorel Toader told reporters on Wednesday.

The Venice Commission is part of the Council of Europe rights body. Timmermans is the European Commission’s vice president.

Romania is seen as one of the bloc’s most corrupt member states and Brussels keeps its justice system under special monitoring together with southern neighbor Bulgaria.

In fellow former Communist country Poland, an overhaul of the judiciary, coupled with a government drive to expand its powers in other areas, including control of media, has provoked a crisis in relations with the European Union.

Other changes outlined in August in Romania included the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed, so it would be the justice minister naming them rather than the country’s president, who is traditionally above party politics.

However, the PSD leader Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday he would not favor stripping President Klaus Iohannis from the chain of appointing the top prosecutors, suggesting that might be watered down in the final version.

The bill is expected to go to parliament’s legal commission for debate.

Last week, the government reshuffled the cabinet after Prime Minister Mihai Tudose said corruption allegations that forced two ministers to quit had created problems for his government with Brussels.

Dragnea was himself convicted in a vote-rigging case in 2016 for which he received a suspended jail sentence.

But controversy surrounding the PSD did not stop it from winning the 2016 election with support from voters in the countryside and those nostalgic for the communist-era who are more interested in pensions and wages rather than in a fight against graft.",Romania finalizes draft of judiciary overhaul criticized by EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-judiciary/romania-finalizes-draft-of-judiciary-overhaul-criticized-by-eu-idUSKBN1CN29P?il=0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall about 1.3 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million.

The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing.

A Ford spokeswoman said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones.

Ford said the cost of the new recall would be reflected in its fourth-quarter results. Ford said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85‍​ per share.

The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving.

Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.

Ford previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in August 2016.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Paint maker Akzo Nobel warned its operating profit would not grow at all this year, in a further retreat from performance promises made to investors to fend off a 26-billion-euro ($31 billion) takeover approach in May.

The Dutch company blamed the downgrade in full-year earnings forecasts, the second in two months, on disruption caused by hurricane Harvey, rising raw materials costs and “headwinds” at its marine coatings business as the offshore oil industry remains weak.

The maker of Dulux paint insisted on Wednesday it would meet other promises made during its defence against suitor PPG Industries, including the sale or IPO of its Specialty Chemicals Division by early next year and the payment of a one-time dividend of 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) on Dec. 7.

New Akzo CEO Thierry Vanlancker’s position looks secure for the time being. PPG has indicated little appetite for another takeover attempt and activist investor Elliott Advisers -- Akzo’s biggest shareholder which tried to push it into PPG’s arms -- has agreed to put aside disputes with Akzo’s boards for now and support the sale of the chemicals division.

Vanlancker stuck to longer-term financial targets made by his predecessor Ton Buechner in the heat of the takeover battle, including an operating profit (EBIT) margin of 15 percent by the year 2020.

That margin is currently below 12 percent and analysts are sceptical, though Akzo said on Wednesday it would cut 110 million euros in costs in 2018.

“A second profit warning in six weeks calls into question how achievable the ... 2020 EBIT targets are,” said UBS analyst Geoff Haire, who has a “neutral” rating on Akzo shares.

Akzo shares traded 1.8 percent lower at 76.93 euros at 1126 GMT, well short of PPG’s 95 euro proposal.

MANAGEMENT CHANGES

Akzo has struggled since refusing PPG’s advances, seeing both its CEO and CFO resign for health reasons.

Vanlancker blamed “adverse foreign exchange, ongoing industry specific headwinds and supply chain disruptions,” as well as Harvey, for the change in EBIT outlook.

He told reporters that rising pigment costs would continue to squeeze profit margins in paints for the coming 5-6 months as the company passes on cost increases to customers.

UBS said Akzo’s biggest business, industrial coatings, would need sales growth of 4 percent to achieve the 2020 target, while organic growth has averaged just 1 percent since 2012.

Vanlancker said the company has received interest from both strategic and private equity buyers for Specialty Chemicals, which represents around a third of sales and profits and is expected to fetch around 10 billion euros. He said it was too early to say how serious strategic buyers may be.

Reuters reported this month that only private equity buyers are interested in buying the division.

After PPG walked away from buying Akzo on June 1, it is restricted from approaching the company again until December, though it has indicated it is no longer interested in Akzo. Its bid faced nationalist rhetoric from the company’s boards, employee unions and Dutch politicians.

Akzo on Wednesday scheduled an extraordinary shareholders meeting for Nov. 30 to approve the sale of the chemicals unit, the appointment of Maarten de Vries as CFO, and the approval of two new board members.

Akzo said that investor USS, the British pension fund, has proposed an alternative to one of the board candidates backed by Akzo. Shareholders will be able to choose between USS candidate Eric Maurice, a former CEO of ASML, and Akzo’s candidate, Covestro CEO Patrick Thomas.

USS and Elliott declined to comment.

Akzo reported third-quarter operating earnings of 383 million euros ($451 million), down from 442 million euros in the same period a year ago and well shy of a consensus analyst estimate of 432 million euros.

Frankfurt (Reuters) - Nach mehreren vergeblichen Anläufen hat der Dax am Donnerstagnachmittag zwar die 13.000-Punkte-Marke geknackt.

Doch Euphorie hat er damit bei den Anlegern nicht ausgelöst. “Die politischen Krisen sind ja nicht alle auf einmal verschwunden”, sagte ein Händler. Zudem fürchten einige, die Rally sei übertrieben. Viele Experten rechneten aber damit, dass die gut laufenden Geschäfte der großen Unternehmen den deutschen Leitindex noch weiter in die Höhe hieven werden.

Mit rund 12.983 Punkten schloss der Dax unter dem zeitweise aufgestellten neuen Rekord von 13.002 Zählern. Damit lag das Plus zum Vorabend bei 0,1 Prozent. Der EuroStoxx50 kam ebenfalls kaum vom Fleck. Auch an der Wall Street traten die großen Indizes Dow Jones, S&P500 und Nasdaq zum Handelsschluss in Europa auf der Stelle - das allerdings teils ebenfalls auf höchstem Niveau. Schon seit Wochen hangeln sie sich in kleinen Mini-Schritten von Rekord zu Rekord.

Der Sprung des Dax über die 13.000-Punkte-Hürde kam am Donnerstag für die meisten Börsianer zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend. Denn es fehlte ihrer Ansicht nach an echten neuen Impulsen. “Von Euphorie ist hier keine Spur”, kommentierte ein Händler den Dax-Anstieg. Die enge Handelsspanne der vergangenen Tage deute aber darauf hin, dass der endgültige Ausbruch über 13.000 Punkte in den kommenden Tagen recht dynamisch verlaufen könnte, mutmaßte Jochen Stanzl, Analyst beim Broker CMC Markets.

Auslöser der Käufe am Donnerstag war laut Händlern der etwas nachgebende Euro. Die Gemeinschaftswährung verlor zeitweise nach einem unerwartet starken Anstieg der US-Produzentenpreise etwa einen viertel US-Cent auf 1,1840 Dollar. Die zuletzt rückläufigen Zinserwartungen in den USA seien womöglich verfrüht gewesen, erklärte Helaba-Analyst Ralf Umlauf.

Den Anlegern am deutschen Aktienmarkt nahm dies die Sorgen vor einem hohen Wechselkurs, der die Export-Chancen der Unternehmen auf dem Weltmarkt mindert. Noch Anfang der Woche hatte die Krise in Katalonien den Euro belastet und damit den Dax bis auf wenige Zähler an die 13.000er Marke geschoben. Doch nach dem vorläufigen Verzicht Kataloniens auf die Ausrufung der Unabhängigkeit hatte der Euro seinen Aufwärtstrend wieder aufgenommen und noch am Vormittag mit 1,1880 Dollar ein Zweieinhalb-Wochen-Hoch erreicht.

Ireland has called for Britain and the EU to reach a bespoke customs union partnership to eliminate the risk of a “hard” border returning between it and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK’s only land frontier with the EU after its departure.

Varadkar has said he is not ruling out seeking special post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland as a fallback position and on Wednesday raised the prospect of insisting Britain sign up to such an option in advance.

“It is still possible that the overall outcome will be a trade and customs relationships so close to the status quo that a border problem can be avoided, that depends very much on the attitude and positions taken by the UK government in the coming months,” Varadkar told parliament.

“Should that not be possible, however, it will be necessary for the UK to commit to arrangements for Northern Ireland that reflect its unique circumstances and to avoid reintroducing a customs border north and south.”

Varadkar said he stated his concerns to British Prime Minister Theresa May in a 40-minute telephone conversation on Monday.

The border is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved in the first stage of negotiations with Britain before talks on future trading can start, now likely to be in December at the earliest with this week’s deadline set to be missed.

The Irish government must be satisfied that sufficient progress has been made on its issues before agreeing to move the talks on.

The border is particularly sensitive given the decades of violence in Northern Ireland, a British province, over whether it should be part of the United Kingdom or Ireland. Around 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace agreement.

Varadkar welcomed the progress on other related Brexit issues, including the joint principles he said had been drawn up to ensure the continuation of the common travel area between the two countries that predates their entry into the EU in 1972.

He said the sides had also agreed to start work on a common understanding on what commitments would be necessary to effectively protect the 1998 peace deal.","Ireland to seek specific border commitments from Britain, PM says",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CN28Z

LONDON (Reuters) - Political uncertainty is high in Kenya following the annulment of the August presidential elections, the country’s central bank governor said on Wednesday, but political and judicial institutions have emerged stronger in the process.

“The current state of affairs is one of high uncertainty, but I think the point here is that it is all political uncertainty, based on recent announcements by the supreme court and the sequence of events that followed that,” Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge told Reuters in an interview.

“I see it as a mark of maturity of the democratic process,” he added.

Speaking on the economic impact of the current situation, Njoroge said that the central bank was in the process of revising down its growth forecast, adding the recent drought had been another factor in slowing down economic expansion.

“We still think there isn’t a precipitous collapse in growth, on the contrary we still believe that we will have growth rates above 5 percent,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of a FT Live conference.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc began offering electronics from third-party sellers to Brazilian shoppers on Wednesday, expanding beyond books in the fiercely competitive e-commerce market in Latin America’s largest economy.

The long-awaited move will offer televisions, cell phones and laptops from hundreds of independent sellers on Amazon’s website in Brazil without involving the company in the tricky logistics that have hurt many online retailers in the country.

Alex Szapiro, Amazon’s country manager in Brazil, declined to say if there were plans for the company to stock its own electronics inventory or open a fulfillment center to ship third-party goods more efficiently, as it did simultaneously with the launch of independent sellers in Mexico two years ago.

“Each country has a different playbook,” said Szapiro in an interview with Reuters at Amazon headquarters in Sao Paulo. He helped launch the company’s Brazil business with e-books in 2012 after running operations for Apple Inc in the country for five years.

Shares of local e-commerce rivals MercadoLibre Inc, Magazine Luiza SA and B2W Cia Digital have fallen 14 percent, 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the past week on concerns of heightened competition from Amazon.

Keeping pace with the local e-commerce market, Amazon will parcel purchases into as many as 10 monthly installments without interest, a practice the company started in Brazil for Kindle e-reader sales in 2014, then extended to Mexico and other markets.

Sellers will be paid up-front, minus a 10 percent commission to Amazon and fees of 19 reais ($6) per month or 2 reais per item. Szapiro called the 10 percent commission a “promotional” rate without saying when or how much it would eventually rise.

The chances of Mercedes, 145 points clear of Ferrari with four races remaining, wrapping things up in Austin appear to be overwhelming.

Everything is also stacking up for Hamilton to become only the fifth driver to win more than three championships since the first in 1950, with British bookmakers offering odds of 1/50 on him taking the title.

That compares to 14/1 for Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, Hamilton’s closest rival, and 300/1 on Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas.

While the team may be celebrating on Sunday night, Hamilton may find he has to wait, however.

To do it in Austin, the Briton must finish in the top two and then see where Vettel ends up.

Related Coverage Hamilton can lay claim to be F1's greatest Brit

Hamilton currently enjoys a hefty 59-point advantage, with 100 still to be won. He must score 16 more than his German rival on Sunday to prevent the title battle continuing to Mexico City’s Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on the following weekend.

Third place is worth 15 points and will not be enough.

Even if Hamilton wins in Austin, he will be champion only if Vettel finishes no higher than sixth. If the Briton comes second, then Vettel has to finish eighth or higher to stay in the game.

Reliability, or lack of it, will be a key concern on both sides.

Vettel has failed to finish two of the last three races in Asia, one due to a first lap collision and the other a spark plug problem, and cannot afford any further unreliability on Ferrari’s part.

However, before his nightmare run the German had not finished lower than seventh since Malaysia in Oct. 2016, when he retired with damaged suspension after a collision.

He was fourth in Austin last year, when Mercedes had a one-two finish.

This year Vettel has finished all but six races on the podium and three of those outside the top three were fourth places.

Hamilton has won eight times and finished second three times in 16 races.

Austin has also been particularly good to him with four wins in five years including the last three. Vettel won with Red Bull in 2013.

Even if Mercedes dominate one-two, and Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen prove to be the closest rivals, the chances are that Vettel will still finish in the top five in a race without incident.

In the constructors’ championship, Ferrari need to outscore Mercedes by 17 points to prevent them retaining the title in Austin.

The only occasion Ferrari have done that this season was in Monaco in May when Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen finished one-two while Hamilton was seventh and team mate Valtteri Bottas ended up fourth.",Mercedes and Hamilton on brink of F1 titles,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-usa/mercedes-and-hamilton-on-brink-of-f1-titles-idUKKBN1CN1U3

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed above the 23,000-mark in late morning trading on Wednesday with solid support from IBM, which reported strong earnings.

Shares of IBM (IBM.N) surged 9 percent and accounted for nearly 92 of the 136 point gain in the blue-chip index, after the company signaled it was back on growth path.

The Dow had briefly surpassed the all-time peak on Tuesday but closed 3 points short of the record level. The latest 1,000-point increase was covered in roughly half the time it took the index to move from 21,000 to 22,000.

Solid earnings and hopes that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax cuts have helped the market rally this year.

“We continue to see solid numbers above expectations, stability in terms of economic growth and global growth,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.

“Announcements by the ECB next week and decision by the Fed in December will probably have a higher impact on whether or not we continue this rally.”

The dollar climbed higher, tracking higher U.S. Treasury yields, while news on a potential new hawkish Federal Reserve chair and the slow progress of U.S. tax reforms also supported the greenback. [USD/]

Investors are also awaiting the Fed’s issue of the Beige Book, a periodic snapshot on the health of the U.S. economy. The report, due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), will likely show if inflation pressures are accelerating.

The S&P and the tech-heavy Nasdaq also hit record highs but traded in narrow ranges. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by 0.47 percent drop in the telecom services index .SPLRCL, followed by 0.42 percent slide in the utilities index .SPLRCU.

The new chair will need a thick skin as well as an ability to play both defense and offense.","NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - There are two things the next leader of the Federal Reserve must prepare for: a recession and a public beating. The first is a statistical likelihood. The second, however, is a bankable certainty. If there is anything predictable about President Donald Trump, it is his willingness to bully institutions with authority separate from his own. And the U.S. central bank’s effectiveness relies on its independence.

The challenge for whoever leads the Fed after Janet Yellen’s term expires early next year, however, won’t be confined to withstanding intemperate early-morning tweets from a White House boudoir. Since the financial crisis the Fed, like its cousins in Japan, the European Union and elsewhere, has stepped in when fiscal policymakers have not. The next chairperson may also have to push the burden of taking action back to Congress.

Yellen could yet be Trump’s safe fallback choice, but he’s also considering current Fed Governor Jay Powell, former Governor Kevin Warsh and former Treasury official John Taylor. Much of the debate about the candidates, at least up to now, has focused narrowly on their hawkishness or dovishness – Fedspeak for a preference for raising the cost of money on the one hand or for keeping it cheap and plentiful on the other. Yellen’s Fed leans towards the doves, as did the institution under her predecessor Ben Bernanke.

Monetary policy matters. Raising rates too abruptly can stifle economic expansion. Pumping too much money into the financial system risks widespread capital misallocation. The potential for a Fed chair to either crush growth or inflate bubbles is what makes the job best suited for highly intelligent, risk-averse people of considered judgment. All the candidates, being Ivy League-educated students of economics with a preponderance of degrees from Princeton and Stanford, fit this bill.

To investors who obsess over such matters, small differences in their views on the trajectory of interest rates or the pace at which the Fed’s $4 trillion balance sheet should shrink are a big deal. To ordinary citizens, though, these are technical quibbles. What the electorate may care about more is keeping the Fed cushioned from day-to-day politics. Fed independence, both perceived and perhaps to a slightly lesser extent real, has proven crucial to the role of the bureaucrats in the Marriner S. Eccles Building in Washington.

Paul Volcker, who literally towered over both the Fed and politicians from 1979 to 1987, once argued it this way. “The credibility of the Federal Reserve, its commitment to maintaining price stability, and its ability to stand up against partisan political pressures are critical. Independence can’t just be a slogan.” The central banker who raised interest rates – in defiance of the wishes of politicians – so as to crush inflation, continued that the Fed “should not be asked to do too much, to undertake responsibilities that it cannot reasonably meet with the appropriately limited powers provided.”

That’s a nod to the Fed’s finite set of tools and the need for lawmakers to wield their powers to change taxation and spending, not just rely on monetary policy. Despite Bernanke’s urging years ago, Congress has yet to do much on this front since the crisis.

Steady economic and employment growth has obscured this inaction. But things may soon change. Since the Great Depression, the average length from the end of a recession to the beginning of a new one was just under five years. It has been more than eight years since the last downturn ended in June 2009. When the economy turns negative, Trump and legislators will no doubt target the Fed, both as the scapegoat and as a potential rescuer. The new chair will need a thick skin as well as an ability to play both defense and offense.

Set Yellen aside as a known quantity. As for Powell, he has not dramatically distanced himself from the chair he has served since 2012. In a June speech, however, he argued that an attempt by the House of Representatives to audit the Fed “risks inserting the Congress directly into monetary policy decision-making, reversing decades of deliberate effort by the Congress to insulate the Fed from political pressure.”

Taylor seems to agree, insisting in a 2016 speech that “de jure central bank independence is insufficient for generating good monetary policy.” His philosophical bent has been to push for a rules-based system for determining interest rates. The benefit, Taylor has argued, would be to limit the Fed's hand, thus making it even less susceptible to political influence or criticism.

Warsh, a colleague of Taylor’s at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, takes it a step further. “When the recession hits, we will have brought it upon ourselves. And the credibility that central banks and fiscal policymakers need to respond to recessions will also be hit during that same episode,” he told me during a Reuters Newsmaker panel last year.

The deal worked out by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would meet some Democratic objectives, including reviving the subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The Trump administration said last week it would stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help lower-income Americans pay medical expenses, part of the Republican president’s effort to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law.

The subsidies to private insurers cost the government an estimated $7 billion this year and were forecast at $10 billion for 2018. Trump’s move to scuttle them had raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets.

Trump hoped to make good on his campaign promise to dismantle the law when he took office in January, with Republicans, who pledged for seven years to scrap it, controlling Congress. But he has been frustrated with their failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace it.

Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans. Republicans say it is ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.

The Alexander-Murray plan could keep Obamacare in place at least until the 2020 presidential campaign starts heating up.

“This takes care of the next two years. After that, we can have a full-fledged debate on where we go long-term on healthcare,” Alexander said of the deal.

It is unclear whether the agreement can make it through Congress.

Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said it had “broad support” among senators in his party, but it was harder to gauge possible support among Republicans.

Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who helped sink earlier Obamacare repeal legislation, voiced backing for the new plan, but conservative Republicans may be less welcoming.

Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, threw his weight behind the effort. In an interview with Reuters, Sanders said Alexander was a “well-respected figure” known for bipartisanship and that the Tennessee senator’s reputation would help propel the legislation through the Senate.

The willingness of Sanders, a liberal champion, to offer his support of a deal with Republicans that could allow states to change some Obamacare requirements provided a boost to the Alexander-Murray effort. ”We are going to overturn what Trump is trying to do,” Sanders said.

Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the plan to a vote on the Senate floor and urged the House of Representatives to take it up then as quickly as possible so Trump can sign it.

TRUMP STILL SEEKS LONG-TERM SOLUTION

Trump, during comments at the White House, suggested he could get behind the Alexander-Murray plan as a short-term solution.

In remarks later at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, Trump commended the work by Alexander and Murray, but said: “I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

Trump said earlier he wanted lawmakers, once they completed a major tax reform effort, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Alexander is its chairman.

She said the two were able to find common ground on the steps aimed at stabilizing the insurance markets created under Obamacare and to “help protect families from premium spikes as a result of the sabotage we have seen from this administration.”

According to a document seen by Reuters, the plan would make it easier for states to get waivers approved that would allow them to offer cheaper healthcare plans, including catastrophic health plans, which cover a limited set of benefits and are currently only available to those under 30.

Shares of U.S. hospital operators, including Tenet Healthcare Corp and HCA Healthcare Inc, moved higher after news of the deal. Tenet shares closed 5.3 percent higher, while HCA rose 2.2 percent. Shares of some U.S. health insurers also extended their gains on the day, with Anthem Inc finishing up 1.9 percent and Centene Corp gaining 3.2 percent.

Analyst Brian Tanquilut of global investment banking firm Jefferies, who focuses on hospital companies, said that if the deal is passed in Congress, it should stabilize the Obamacare insurance exchanges and improve their viability.

“Hospitals will avoid a potential spike in bad debt and charity care next year,” Tanquilut said. “This is obviously a good step.

Allergan said in September that it had transferred its Restasis patents to the tribe, which agreed to license the patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments.
Some legal experts said it is too early to declare Allergan’s patent gambit a failure.
Jacob Sherkow, a professor of patent law at New York Law School, said PTAB may still rule in favor of Allergan on its sovereign immunity defense.","(Reuters) - A U.S. judge’s ruling on Monday invalidating Allergan Plc’s (AGN.N) patents on its blockbuster $1.5 billion dry-eye medicine, Restasis, has cast doubt on the company’s novel strategy to enlist a Native American tribe to help shield those patents from challenge by generic drugmakers, legal experts said.

In a deal announced last month, Allergan transferred the Restasis patents to New York state’s Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, claiming the group’s status as a sovereign nation meant the patents could not be reviewed by the U.S. patent office.

Allergan said the move was justified because the same patents were already being reviewed in federal court, but critics said it was a cynical attempt to prolong the company’s monopoly on Restasis.

The federal judge, William Bryson, expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the tribal transfer, calling it a ploy by Allergan to “rent” the tribe’s sovereign immunity.

He did not rule directly on whether the transfer was legal, however, because that question was not squarely before him. But his decision on Monday rendered Allergan’s move largely meaningless, since he invalidated the Restasis patents himself instead of waiting for the patent office to rule.

Allergan said it was disappointed by Bryson’s decision to invalidate the patents and vowed to appeal.

Legal experts said the rebuke from a prominent judge will make other patent owners reluctant to copy Allergan’s maneuver.

“This should flash some serious yellow lights, if not red lights, in front of parties considering a deal like this,” said Michael Carrier, a professor of patent law at Rutgers Law School.

PR BACKLASH

The dispute over the Restasis patents dates back to 2015 when generic drug companies led by Mylan NV (MYL.O) asked a federal judge sitting in Texas to invalidate Allergan’s Restasis patents in hopes of launching their own generic versions of the medicine.

The generic drugmakers also asked the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), an administrative court run by the patent office, to revoke the patents. Companies often ask both a federal judge and PTAB to cancel patents.

Allergan said in September that it had transferred its Restasis patents to the tribe, which agreed to license the patents back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments.

The company said the PTAB proceeding should be terminated because the tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the tribe. Allergan said it wanted to avoid defending the patent in both federal court and before PTAB.

But after Bryson’s ruling, other patent owners will be less likely to transfer such patents to tribes to shield them from review, said Rachel Sachs, a professor of patent law at Washington University in St. Louis.

Bryson said “sovereign immunity should not be treated as a monetizable commodity that can be purchased by private entities as part of a scheme to evade their legal responsibilities.”

Sachs said Bryson is a well-regarded judge and that his reasoning could be cited by other courts, including PTAB judges.

She noted the ruling comes after weeks of criticism on Capitol Hill, where politicians have slammed Allergan’s move as a sham, with one U.S. senator introducing a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty. [nL2N1MG26D]

In a research note on Monday, analysts at Credit Suisse said Allergan suffered a “public relations backlash” from the deal without helping its bottom line.

Allergan said in a statement on Tuesday that its deal with the tribe has helped raised awareness about the need to reform the PTAB process, which the company said does not provide due process to patent owners.

Some legal experts said it is too early to declare Allergan’s patent gambit a failure.

Jacob Sherkow, a professor of patent law at New York Law School, said PTAB may still rule in favor of Allergan on its sovereign immunity defense.

If that happens, Allergan’s deal with the tribe could be copied by other patent owners, said Joshua Landau, a patent lawyer with the trade group Computer & Communications Industry Association.

Bryson’s decision “will make patent owners question the arrangement, but I don’t know if the ruling will prevent it entirely,” Landau said.",Allergan ruling casts doubt on tribal patent strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-allergan-patents-analysis/allergan-ruling-casts-doubt-on-tribal-patent-strategy-idUSKBN1CM369

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.","LONDON (Reuters) - Last week’s shocking British election result and the period of political uncertainty that looks set to follow may have come at the worst of times for the country’s economy and the value of the pound sterling.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

REUTERS - IBM shares surged 5 percent on Wednesday after the world’s first big computing company beat expectations on third-quarter revenue and gave an outlook that hinted it was back on a growth track after six years in retreat.

There was no initial sign of changes to major brokerage trading recommendations or price targets for International Business Machines Inc and most shied away from calling a complete turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

But the results pushed Big Blue shares 4.7 percent higher to $153.40 in premarket in New York, in stark contrast with a nearly 12 percent fall so far this year.

“We were pleased to see the quality of IBM’s earnings improve, with IP income and taxes being less of a driver of upside than in prior quarters,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note.

While IBM has struggled more than peers such as Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp to adjust their approach to a changing market, the quarterly performance of its software business was noteworthy given its presence in key software markets, Jefferies analyst John DiFucci wrote in a note.

IBM’s revenue has fallen for 22 straight quarters as weak demand from customers left its legacy hardware and software businesses stagnating.

The company’s software revenue also grew for the first time after 13 consecutive quarters of declines.

“We see the business as secularly challenged due to its high exposure to a legacy business model, and see continued margin pressure over the long-term as IBM’s business is pressured by competition from lower-cost offerings and the cloud,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note.

But she added: “We are modestly adjusting our FY-17E EPS higher on a lower share count and some additional mainframe sales.”

Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,279.58 an ounce at 1155 GMT, having touched its lowest since Oct. 9 at $1,279.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery were off 0.4 percent at $1,281.40.

“Interest rate hikes had not been fully priced in for next year. That has changed massively following speculation that (Fed Governor Jerome) Powell might become the next chairman,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.

U.S. President Donald Trump has a pool of five candidates to choose from for the next chair of the Fed and is likely to announce his choice before going to Asia in early November, a source familiar with the situation said.

Jerome Powell will likely be the next Federal Reserve chairman, according to a slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll, though most of them said that incumbent Janet Yellen would be the best option.

The dollar edged higher on the speculation and as the market awaited more detail on Trump’s tax reform.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year in December.

Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

“With dollar strength in mind, it would present further risks to gold, but I‘m waiting to see how the Catalonia crisis unfolds tomorrow, pinpointing a possible next move for gold, in either direction,” said Jameel Ahmad, vice president of market research at FXTM.

Catalonia refused on Tuesday to bow to the Spanish government’s demand that it renounce a symbolic declaration of independence, setting it on a political collision course with Madrid this week.

Gold is often used as a store of wealth in times of political or economic uncertainty.

MKS precious metals trader Sam Laughlin said the $1,280 an ounce support remained intact but further weakness could test the 100-day moving average at $1,275.

Support below that level sat between the early October low of $1,260 and the 200-day moving average at $1,257, he said.

In other precious metals, silver was down 0.1 percent at $16.96 an ounce after touching its lowest in more than a week.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Call them China’s bubble generation.

They were born after the crushing of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, raised mostly without siblings during an unprecedented economic boom, and came of age as Xi Jinping, China’s strongest leader in decades, ascended to power.

It’s a generation that grew up in an era of prosperity and peace; one that has not “eaten bitterness” - or struggled - as their parents and grandparents did.

With Xi starting another five years as China’s top leader, Reuters sought to get to know some members of this bubble generation - 10 people who graduated from university and entered the workforce when Xi’s first term started five years ago.

They are the “Class of 2012”.

The 10 men and women represent just a fraction of the 190 million people born in the 1990s, but they provided key insights into Xi’s China and the generation that will inherit his legacy.

They live in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan and Putuan, in Hubei province. Their backgrounds are diverse. They are the sons and daughters of a former factory owner, restaurateurs, a doctor, a construction worker, a local official, and a school administrator.

They attended three different universities – China’s leading trade and economics college in Beijing, a regional university in the central city of Wuhan, and a third-tier technology school in the southwestern city of Chengdu.

That makes them somewhat privileged in a country where relatively few people get to pursue higher education.

Their experiences differ, often widely. And yet, they have much in common.

They are optimistic, open-minded and tend to have a free-spirited streak, even though family roots and obligations remain important. For the unmarried among them, some feel acute pressure to find a mate. Others actively reject the traditional path.

“A good thing about our generation is that, I think, we have more direction in our lives,” said Wu Qiong, the 27-year-old daughter of an insurance saleswoman and a kindergarten headmaster in Wuhan. “Really, you know how you want to live your life, rather than everyone living the same way.”

They crave travel and experiences, and grew up in comfort for the most part. Most have had everything they’ve needed - food and clothing - and often more, things like Nintendo Gameboys or vacations.

They’ve all known extraordinary economic growth year in and year out, making a painful slowdown hard to imagine. Property prices only rise in their world – a double edged sword for young adults trying to get established.

China’s upward trajectory is a given.

“I think the world is getting better and better,” said Qin Lijuan, 28, a personal finance consultant in Chengdu. “Even if we face an economic crisis, as long as you make safe plans your life is still worry-free.”

Members of the “Class of 2012”, like many in China, project political apathy – reflecting perhaps instinctual caution on a sensitive topic in the presence of journalists, or possibly genuine insouciance.

“I don’t care about politics because my job has nothing to do with politics,” said Zheng Yue, 27, an interior designer in Chengdu. “And also I can’t solve political problems. Even if I cared a lot about it, it’s no use. I can’t change anything.”

When political issues are injected into their daily lives, as with internet censorship, they always find a workaround so they can see their favourite television shows or news stories they’re interested in.

BUBBLY OPTIMISM

Xi faces deep socio-economic challenges, and has made it clear that he believes more government control - not less - is what the country needs.

But what if things go sideways, if the China narrative shifts, or if the economy slows significantly, as many economists think is inevitable? What if it hits a brick wall?

“Young Chinese seem to share with young Americans of the 1950s and 1960s a near-unbridgeable generation gap and a huge optimism,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.

But, he said, they are probably ill-prepared for future shocks, despite the experiences and advice of their parents.

Try telling that to Wu.

Born and raised in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province some 700 km (435 miles) inland from Shanghai, she is in many ways emblematic of the “Class of 2012”.

Articulate and cheerful, Wu decided after graduating from university that the English degree she earned was insufficient to pursue her ambitions - so she got a Master’s degree in accounting. She now works in the international settlements department of a foreign bank.

She hasn’t been able to buy property herself, but she recently persuaded her mother to invest some of her life savings in an apartment in a development called “Cambridge City”. The buildings are next to a subway line under construction. Their plan is to flip it in a couple years.

“The appreciation in house values is much bigger than the return on fixed-term deposits at banks,” Wu said. “For sure it won’t go down.”

In terms of job security, Wu also doesn’t seem to worry.

“In my life I‘m not afraid of the future at all,” she said. “I don’t fear change.”

And, she adds, “if some day there’s a big economic crisis and the financial sector falls into recession I think I could go back and be an English teacher.”",Coming of age in an era of prosperity - Meet China's 'bubble generation',https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-congress-classof2012/coming-of-age-in-an-era-of-prosperity-meet-chinas-bubble-generation-idUKKBN1CM1GT

Reuters analysis of federal jobs data shows that out of 656,000 new manufacturing jobs created between 2010 and 2014, two thirds can be attributed to foreign direct investment.

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The financial regulator said that younger consumers and renters were among the most financially stretched, with those in difficulty defined as having failed to pay bills in three or more of the last six months and most likely to be in the 25-34 age range.

The survey of 13,000 people, showed that nearly half of renters said they would struggle to meet a rent rise of less than a hundred pounds a month.

This comes at a time when consumer credit has grown at rates that have raised regulatory concerns, and the Bank of England has signalled that an interest rate rise may be on the cards as inflation climbs to 5-1/2 year highs.

Wage growth in Britain continues to lag behind inflation, eroding consumers’ ability to pay rising bills.

“We are in a situation where it’s fair to say that there is a significant group of people who have never experienced a rise in interest rates,” said Chris Woolard, the FCA’s executive director of strategy and competition.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s economics ministry said it is “deeply concerned” about the antitrust agency imposing a $775 million fine on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), in a rare public display of disagreement between authorities.

Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) fined Qualcomm last week, saying the U.S. chipmaker had abused its monopolistic position by opting against licensing some modem-related technologies to other industry players.

Qualcomm said it disagreed and would take the matter to court once the agency releases a final report in coming weeks.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees industrial policy, said it respected the agency’s position but was concerned about any impact on foreign investment.

“With regards to the investigation and judgment process... our ministry is deeply concerned,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday.

“Considering economic stability and prosperity, as well as that the economics ministry is the government authority overseeing industry, the ministry would like to see better coordination between industrial development and fair trading.”

The ministry said the agency did not appear to take into account Qualcomm’s contribution to the overall local technology industry or impact on future business opportunities, describing the U.S. firm as an “indispensable partner”.

The FTC did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) supported the FTC’s action in a statement on Oct. 12, reiterating views of some industry players that it would lead to a fairer business environment for technological innovation.

The action is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing patents related to installation and use.

Since the beginning of the year, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has opened a new engineering office in Mexico City, while Facebook Inc (FB.O) has partnered with local groups to develop technical talent in the region.

Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) plans to expand its offices in the Pacific coast state of Jalisco, local officials said, possibly bringing hundreds of jobs.

In Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital, a new group devoted to recruiting startups expects to have 10 new companies in the region by year-end, with another 60 in the pipeline. And the landlord of choice for many startups, the shared-office juggernaut WeWork, said it has opened five locations and now serves 6,000 workers after debuting in Mexico City last September.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to reduce immigration to the United States, including new constraints on H-1B visas for skilled workers - which many tech companies rely on for attracting foreign talent - have prompted countries ranging from China to Canada to step up recruiting tech workers and startup companies that might once have found a home in the United States.

For Mexico, there is an added urgency: more than 600,000 immigrants of Mexican origin are currently covered by the U.S. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which offers protection from deportation for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.

Those individuals, known as “Dreamers,” may soon have to look for work abroad as a result of the Trump administration’s September decision to let DACA expire.

“This may be a good soft landing for people who are incredibly well prepared and may be able to take advantage of building their American Dream back in Mexico,” said Bismarck Lepe, chief executive of Wizeline, a San Francisco tech firm with 260 employees in Mexico City and Guadalajara.

Wizeline has invited Dreamers, who could now face deportation, to apply for jobs that would allow them to work in Mexico for a year before obtaining the necessary visa to return to the United States. Wizeline plans to use the L1 and TN visas, the latter of which is a visa covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows citizens of Canada and Mexico to work in the United States for business purposes.

To be sure, it is not yet clear if the benefit to Mexico’s tech industry will be deep or long-lasting. The fate of the Dreamers remains uncertain as Congress could still pass legislation continuing the program.

Mexican government statistics have not so far shown an uptick in temporary residence cards granted to foreign workers, suggesting that most prospective U.S. H-1B visa applicants are not yet looking south.

SIMPLE PITCH

Nonetheless, Mexico’s tech sector has been adding jobs at a healthy rate in recent years, and all signs point to continued strength.

Software job growth this year in Mexico’s three largest metropolitan areas - Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey - hit 8.8 percent, 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively, according to data compiled by LinkedIn.

That is up from respective annual growth of 6.8 percent, 4.6 percent and 6.8 percent in 2016, LinkedIn told Reuters.

“Where there is a strong engineering presence and opportunity, at some point it makes more sense to go to the market itself and establish an office there,” said Steve McPherson, senior manager of software development for Amazon.com. The company has not disclosed the size of its technical team in Mexico, but McPherson said it is hiring aggressively.

Facebook, meanwhile, has launched three programs this year in the Mexican capital, including a partnership with Dev.F, a local coding academy. These programs are the groundwork for a potential tech expansion into Mexico by the world’s largest social media network, said Dev.F co-founder Manuel “Eme” Morato. Facebook now has close to 100 employees in Mexico.

In Guadalajara, local nonprofit StartupGDL launched a program earlier this year to attract young, high-growth potential tech startups to the region.

The pitch is simple: universities in Jalisco graduate between 7,000 and 8,000 engineers each year. The cost of living and wages are low by comparison to Silicon Valley. Guadalajara offers direct flights to the Bay Area and is only two hours ahead of California. And immigration into Mexico is easy for tech workers.

Thus far in 2017, five foreign companies have opened offices in Guadalajara, according to StartupGDL, and the organization expects three to five more by year-end.

“I look for people who are mission-focused, and I saw a lot of that down there,” said Pat Calhoun, chief executive of Espressive, a Santa Clara, California, tech firm that opened an office in Guadalajara in March.

Pablo Lemus, mayor of Zapopan, a city in Jalisco that is home to companies including Oracle and the electronics manufacturer Flex, estimates that 40 to 50 startups may open offices in the city this year and next.

DREAMER OPPORTUNITY

Some companies are focused specifically on recruiting Dreamers.

“They are highly capable people, bilingual in most cases, who have a very valiant experience,” said Luis Aguirre, vice president of government relations for contract electronics manufacturer Sanmina Corp (SANM.O), which has a large presence in Jalisco. “We will be gaining a great pool of talent.”

Zapopan has begun a campaign to attract Dreamers, placing brochures in Mexican consulates in the United States, said Lemus, the mayor.

Employment in the tech sector in Jalisco has climbed steadily in recent years and is projected to reach 115,000 jobs in 2017, up from 105,000 in 2015, said Jaime Reyes, the state’s secretary of innovation, science and technology.

The state is set to capitalize even further as Trump’s immigration crackdown takes effect, Jalisco Governor Aristóteles Sandoval told Reuters, even though some tech companies are keeping quiet about their plans in the delicate U.S. political climate.

Firms outside the United States are trying to capitalize on the Trump administration’s changes to the H-1B visa program, which has become a much slower and more cumbersome route to obtaining a U.S. work permit. This year, applications for H-1B visas declined for the first time in five years.

Satyen Timbadia, an Indian who owns a midsize IT outsourcing company in Mexico, said the H-1B restrictions influenced his decision to expand a planned engineering and design center in Guadalajara, which will accommodate 250 to 300 workers.

“Trump has done only one thing – make life easier for us,” said Timbadia, CEO of Daksha Consulting.

At Wizeline, one of the key benefits of operating in Mexico has been the ability to attract and relocate foreign workers. Since opening offices there in 2014, the company has brought in workers from France, India and China, and other countries.

In August, Wizeline relocated Egyptian software engineer Kareem Salah, 22. Salah was able to move to Mexico from Egypt within a month of graduating from college in Cairo and getting a job offer from Wizeline.

“It was extremely easy,” Salah said.",Mexico tech industry benefits from U.S. anti-immigration stance,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-mexico-tech/mexico-tech-industry-benefits-from-u-s-anti-immigration-stance-idUSKBN1CM1F2

Appealing for information to help identify the conman, Branson said he suspected the same person had later impersonated him to steal $2 million from a friend of his by pretending to raise funds for people affected by Hurricane Irma.

“This story sounds like it has come straight out of a John le Carre book or a James Bond film, but it is sadly all true,” Branson wrote in a blog.

Instantly recognizable with his wavy blond hair and beard, Branson is one of Britain’s best-known businessmen. The Virgin brand is licensed for use by a range of businesses from airlines to train companies to telecoms and gyms.

Branson wrote that six months ago, after an elaborate set-up involving a note on fake government notepaper, he spoke on the phone to someone purporting to be Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

The man told Branson that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom by terrorists.

He said that while the government did not pay ransoms, there was a particularly sensitive reason why the diplomat had to be saved, and the government was confidentially asking a syndicate of British business people to step in.

“I was asked to contribute $5 million of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back,” Branson wrote.

Feeling suspicious, Branson checked with the government and was told that Fallon had not spoken to him. The matter was reported to the police.

Six months on, Branson learnt that a friend, whom he described as a very successful businessman in the United States, had been called by a conman posing as him.

“When the call happened, the conman did an extremely accurate impression of me and spun a big lie about urgently needing a loan while I was trying to mobilize aid in the BVI (British Virgin Islands),” he wrote.

Branson owns a small island in the BVI archipelago which, as was well publicized, was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The caller took advantage of that context.

“They claimed I couldn’t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn’t have any communications going to Europe and I’d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America,” Branson wrote.

“The business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2 million, which promptly disappeared.”

A spokesman for Fallon said he was aware of two attempts, one not involving Branson, to impersonate the minister for illicit gain, and Fallon’s office were assisting the police in their efforts to try to catch those responsible.",Billionaire Branson targeted in $5 million scam 'straight out of le Carre',https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-fraud-branson/billionaire-branson-targeted-in-5-million-scam-straight-out-of-le-carre-idUSKBN1CN1AC

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed above the 23,000-mark in late morning trading on Wednesday with solid support from IBM, which reported strong earnings.

Shares of IBM (IBM.N) surged 9 percent and accounted for nearly 92 of the 136 point gain in the blue-chip index, after the company signaled it was back on growth path.

The Dow had briefly surpassed the all-time peak on Tuesday but closed 3 points short of the record level. The latest 1,000-point increase was covered in roughly half the time it took the index to move from 21,000 to 22,000.

Solid earnings and hopes that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax cuts have helped the market rally this year.

“We continue to see solid numbers above expectations, stability in terms of economic growth and global growth,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.

“Announcements by the ECB next week and decision by the Fed in December will probably have a higher impact on whether or not we continue this rally.”

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

He faces a choice between two continuity candidates, Yellen and Governor Jerome Powell, and a clutch of outsiders, including Gary Cohn, currently his top economic advisor, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor.

Here are short profiles of the candidates:

Gary Cohn, 57, Director of the National Economic Council

Experience: Longtime Goldman Sachs employee and president and chief operating officer of the Wall Street bank from 2006 to 2017.

Education: Bachelor’s degree in business, American University

Policy positions: Cohn’s current job as director of the NEC has given him little reason to comment on monetary policy, but he has worried in the past that the Fed has been “constrained” by the actions of other central banks trying to keep their currencies weak.

In his own words: “If we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rates by (3 percent), the world would be a much better place.”

Pros to candidacy:

A practitioner’s understanding of financial markets at a time the Fed is attempting to unwind its bond portfolio bought after the 2008 financial crisis

The trust of the White House and many congressional Republicans given Cohn’s high-profile role in the Trump administration

Cons to candidacy:

No formal economics background at a time when the Fed leans ever more on econometric models to decipher mixed signals in inflation and employment data

A decades-long career at Goldman Sachs and a personal fortune worth at least $260 million, which could raise eyebrows when it comes to confirmation by the Senate, where members on both sides see the investment bank as a symbol of financial industry excess

Criticism of Trump in the wake of Charlottesville, Virginia, protests

Jerome Powell, 64, Federal Reserve Governor

Experience: Lawyer and investment banker; partner in private equity firm Carlyle Group from 1997-2005; Senior Treasury official under George H.W. Bush; Fed Governor since 2012 (appointed by President Obama)

Education: Bachelor’s degree in politics, Princeton University; Law degree from Georgetown University

Policy positions: Powell has never dissented while at the Fed, and in line with Yellen supports slowly raising interest rates as long as the economy continues growing and inflation is expected to rise. He advocates easing some aspects of the Dodd-Frank regulations and has discussed ways to revise the Volcker Rule.

In his own words: “The Committee has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends ... I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates.”

Pros to candidacy:

An uncontroversial pick for the position, could be the compromise who both replaces Yellen and provides continuity

Only Republican currently on the Board of Governors, has already helped guide the economy in its recovery and would likely get bipartisan support in Congress

Familiarity with markets and financial regulation may be considered a plus

Cons to candidacy:

As a current Fed member identified with the more centrist wing of the Republican Party, may not provide enough of a change if Trump decides to replace Yellen

Expertise is less in formal economics and more in markets and financial regulation, which may seem too much of an overlap with the new vice chair for supervision, Randal Quarles

John Taylor, 70, Senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution

Experience: Undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs in the George W. Bush administration from 2001 to 2005; member of Council of Economic Advisers under presidents Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush

Education: PhD in economics, Stanford University

Policy positions: Developer of the eponymous “Taylor Rule” for setting interest rates, Taylor feels the Fed should transition to a rules-based policy in order to make its decision-making “predictable-transparent-accountable.”

In his own words: “It is very important to have a basic understanding of the monetary policy strategy. The FOMC should be required to adopt and explain its monetary strategy, and then compare that strategy with monetary policy rules that are out there in a transparent way.”

Pros to candidacy:

A trained economist whose elegantly simple research in the 1990s transformed the debate over how central banks set rates

Support among key Capitol Hill Republicans who feel the Fed has too much discretion

Well known in central banking circles, even if his ideas are not universally supported

Cons to candidacy:

A long-term member of the central banking and academic cliques Trump may want to disrupt

Advocacy of rule-based policy may land with a thud in an institution that thrives on consensus and judgment

Break with Yellen and current policy framework could disrupt markets if Taylor insists on broad reform

Kevin Warsh, 47, Visiting Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution

Experience: Fed governor from 2006 to 2011; economic adviser to President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2006; M&A lawyer at Morgan Stanley for seven years

Education: Bachelor’s degree in public policy, Stanford University; Law degree from Harvard University

Policy positions: Warsh feels the Fed should not try to fine-tune the economy and argues policymakers have too much discretion. He feels the Fed should aim for inflation between 1 and 2 percent, effectively lowering its inflation target.

In his own words: “We should not accept the Fed’s newfound conviction that a very low neutral equilibrium real short-term interest rate (r*) is a fixed feature of future monetary policy ... The central bank and the academic community should engage in a fundamental rethinking of the Fed’s strategy, tools, governance, and communications.”

Pros to candidacy:

Former banker and for several years former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s right-hand man on financial markets, has a familiarity with Wall Street

Wife Jane Lauder Warsh is a daughter of cosmetics magnate Ron Lauder, a longtime friend of Trump

Served on the president’s economic advisory council before it disbanded

Cons to candidacy:

May be seen as too hawkish by a president who calls himself a “low interest rate person”

Not an academic economist like Yellen or Bernanke but has still maintained U.S. monetary policy needs a full makeover

Worried about inflation even as the 2008 financial crisis hit, and quit the Fed over its second round of bond-buying, a possible black mark against his judgment given the success of the “quantitative easing” program

Even while quitting over Fed bond buying, never dissented on FOMC decisions

Janet Yellen, 71, Federal Reserve Chair

Experience: Also served as a Fed governor, President of the San Francisco Fed, and the Fed’s vice chair from 2010 to 2014

Education: PhD in economics, Yale University

Policy positions: Yellen steered the Fed towards “gradual” rate increases and a slow reduction of its balance sheet, dependent on evidence of a continued economic recovery. She argues that post-crisis financial regulation has made the economy more stable without sacrificing growth.

In her own words: “My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market ... or even the fundamental forces driving inflation ... How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments.”

Pros to candidacy:

After a career in the Fed system and four years as its head, has earned the trust of markets and shown she can shift policy without major disruption

A growing economy, low unemployment, and strong stock markets make the case for continuity, while Trump has said publicly he feels she is doing a good job

Cons to candidacy:

Could be seen as a Democratic holdover by a President who may want to put his own stamp on the Fed

Feels the core regulations approved after the financial crisis should remain intact, a possible friction with the administration’s deregulatory bent

(Reuters) - Apple Inc and General Electric Co say they are working together to make it easier to write software that can track power plants and jet engines on Apple’s iPhones and iPads.

The companies have come up with a tool for app developers to connect Apple’s iOS operating system more easily to Predix, the cloud-based software at the heart of GE’s effort to turn itself into a “digital industrial” company.

The Predix software connects sensor-laden industrial machines like wind turbines, jet engines and elevators to data centers, so that streams of information from the machines can be analyzed to help predict failures and make the machines run more cost effectively.

GE expects the software to help generate $12 billion in digital revenue by 2020, though it took a two-month “time-out” earlier this year to iron out technical problems.

Now with the help of the new software built with Apple, which GE plans to release on Oct. 26, more information from Predix will be available to the on-the-ground managers of factories and power plants who work most closely with GE’s equipment, said Kevin Ichhpurani, executive vice president of global ecosystem and channels at GE Digital.

For example, Ichhpurani said, a power plant manager might be debating the best time to take a generator offline for scheduled maintenance. With the Predix software, the manager can see data on the machine and could share notes and photographs from an iPad at the site of the generator and even start a video call.

“These decisions can be made at the power plant or on the factory floor, as opposed to being made at corporate,” Ichhpurani told Reuters in an interview.

As part of arrangements between the two companies, GE plans to make iPhones and iPads the standard mobile devices for its 330,000 employees and will also offer Mac desktop computers as a choice for them.

In return, Apple will help promote GE’s Predix software to Apple’s enterprise customers. Apple’s salespeople will be trained on Predix’s capabilities and will promote the software in sales situations alongside iOS devices, Susan Prescott, vice president of product market at Apple, told Reuters.

Over the past several years, Apple has courted business software firms such as Accenture PLC, International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, Deloitte and SAP SE in an effort to move business applications over to iOS devices and make them easier to use in corporate settings.","Apple and GE team up on software to track power plants, machinery",https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-ge/apple-and-ge-team-up-on-software-to-track-power-plants-machinery-idINKBN1CN1RC

Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.
In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.
Ford previously recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014, including 2.4 million vehicles recalled in August 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall about 1.3 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million.

The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing.

A Ford spokeswoman said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones.

Ford said the cost of the new recall would be reflected in its fourth-quarter results. Ford said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85‍​ per share.

The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving.

Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber rammed a car into a police truck in the southwestern city of Quetta on Wednesday, killing at least seven people, police said.

The attack killed five police officials and two passers-by on the outskirts of the city of Quetta, police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema said. He said 22 people were wounded, eight of them critically.

Sarfraz Bugti, the home minister of Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is capital, told Reuters: “It was a suicide blast.”

Quetta is about 100 km (60 miles) east of the border with Afghanistan.

Bugti said the truck carrying the police officials was on its way to the city to drop them at their posts when the suicide bomber rammed into the vehicle. Television pictures showed the burnt wreckage of the vehicles.

Baluchistan province has long been the scene of an insurgency by separatists fighting against the state to demand more of a share of the gas- and mineral-rich region’s resources. They also accuse the central government of discrimination.

The Taliban, Sunni Islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State group also operate in the strategically important region, which borders Iran as well as Afghanistan.

The violence has fuelled concern about security for projects in the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan’s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

A suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State at a Sufi Muslim shrine this month killed 22 people and wounded more than 30.

Ayub Qureshi, the provincial police chief, said a counter-terrorism police officer was shot and killed in another part of Quetta as authorities were dealing with the suicide bombing.

A militant sectarian faction, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi, claimed responsibility for killing the counter-terrorism official, and for planting a roadside bomb in a northwestern region, that killed two soldiers.

Security officials said a remote-controlled bomb was set off as an army vehicle passed by.","Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber rams police truck, kills seven",https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-blast/pakistani-taliban-suicide-bomber-rams-police-truck-kills-7-idINKBN1CN0GP

TORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted prayers for Downie’s family, adding that “our hearts break on news of the passing of ... an ally and friend.”

Downie had become an outspoken supporter of Canada’s indigenous people, penning songs about the painful legacy of colonialism and urging Canadians toward reconciliation.

In their statement, Downie’s family said the singer had spent his last days making music and memories with family and friends.

“Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years - those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars,” the statement said.","Canada's Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie dies, PM weeps",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CN1XZ-OCATP

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Toxic fumes from kitchen drains forced the European Union on Wednesday to switch the venue of its summit in Brussels less than 24 hours before leaders were due to begin the two-day meeting.

The Europa Building, also known as “The Egg” and opened only in January amid controversy over its cost, was evacuated for the second time in a week on Wednesday after catering staff were taken ill due to fumes suspected to be leaking from the drains.

As a “precautionary measure”, the summit will now take place next door in the Justus Lipsius Building, an anonymous 1990s glass and stone-clad structure, which housed Europe’s councils until the opening of the 321-million-euro ($378 million) Europa.

The new building incorporates an exterior of jumbled salvaged window frames, a summit chamber painted a psychedelic patchwork, and an illuminated “lantern” containing several stories of offices that is visible from the street and known to locals as “Van Rompuy’s Egg” after the Belgian former summit chair.

About 20 kitchen staff were treated in hospital on Friday and an EU official said the Council and Belgian safety bodies were working on the assumption that Wednesday’s incident was due to the same source.

It was unclear how many staff were made ill on Wednesday.

Highlights of the summit are likely include an address by British Prime Minister Theresa May to the other 27 on her Brexit plans over dinner on Thursday and a statement to be agreed by the 27 on Friday that will demand London offer tens of billions of euros more on its withdrawal in 2019 if it wants to start negotiating a future relationship based on a free trade pact.",Egged off: EU summit venue switched after noxious fumes,https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-summit-fumes/egged-off-eu-summit-venue-switched-after-noxious-fumes-idINKBN1CN1KX?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Netflix’s valuation outstrips its burgeoning opportunity. The $87 billion video-streaming service hit another all-time high on Monday, benefiting in part from Comcast and AT&T recently warning of a fall in subscribers. Pay-TV customers cutting the cord should mean more viewers for Netflix. But even that and a fee hike last month don’t justify it trading at a sky-high multiple.

The company led by Reed Hastings added 5.3 million new subscribers in its third quarter, taking its total tally around the world to 109 million customers. That beat the 4.5 million analysts had been expecting. That was after the company’s shares closed at a record $202.68 a piece on Monday, making the firm worth more than Time Warner.

Aiding the run-up is the expected bloodbath in pay-TV subscriptions. Last week AT&T admitted it would lose 90,000 customers in the three months to the end of September as they abandoned its video product because of competition and hurricanes. Rival Comcast had earlier raised a similar yellow flag.

The specter of people ditching expensive cable packages is fast becoming a frightening reality. Pay-TV subscriptions are forecast to decline 3.4 percent in the third quarter, even faster than the bruising 2.7 percent drop in the previous three months, according to MoffettNathanson.

Traditional media companies like Walt Disney are only now contemplating launching their own direct-to-consumer packages. Netflix has the first-mover advantage, having offered streaming video for a decade. Other similar products that CBS and HBO offer have fewer than 5 million subscribers each, just a fraction of the customer base Hastings has built.

Trouble is, Netflix now trades at almost 40 times 2020 earnings. That looks like a work of fiction as it is. But the company also carries sizable risk. Hastings has, for example, pledged up to $8 billion for TV shows and movies next year compared to $5 billion in 2016. He’s also trying to ramp up the amount of content the company can produce in-house to replace licensing third-party shows that currently soak up most of the budget. That suggests Netflix will be burning through cash for a long time yet.",Breakingviews - Netflix valuation outstrips burgeoning opportunity,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-netflix-valuation-outstrips-burgeoning-opportunity-idUSKBN1CL2YA

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.

“I don’t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.”

Trump’s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.

Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran’s state matters, welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.

“European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.”

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran’s compliance with the terms.

Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.

In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

“DO NOT INTERFERE”

In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran’s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons.

Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.

EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran’s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.

“They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America’s bullying and its unreasonable demands,” Khamenei said.

“They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?”

The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran’s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans.

Iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.

“Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region,” Khamenei said.

Supporters of the deal fear Trump’s decision to decertify the deal could eventually unravel it, causing more tension in the crisis-hit Middle East, where Shi‘ite Iran is involved in a decades long proxy war with U.S. ally Sunni Saudi Arabia.

If the deal falls apart, Iran’s anti-Western hardliners will gain authority in a backlash against pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani, who engineered the accord to help end Iran’s political and economic isolation, analysts and insiders say.",Khamenei says Iran will 'shred' nuclear deal if U.S. quits it,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-khamenei/khamenei-says-iran-will-shred-nuclear-deal-if-u-s-quits-it-idUSKBN1CN167?il=0

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic lawmakers called on Wednesday for a congressional committee to issue subpoenas to the White House and three companies for documents about fired national security adviser Michael Flynn.

In a letter to Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, the panel’s Democratic members said the committee should demand documents the White House has refused to hand over despite a bipartisan request in March.

Some of the documents are related to work on a proposal to build nuclear reactors in the Middle East with the involvement of Russian firms.

Three companies - Flynn’s consultancy and two companies he advised on the nuclear project -- have not produced documents and communications the committee’s minority members requested on September 15, and should be compelled to cooperate, the Democratic members said.

Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined to comment.

The committee has been probing whether Flynn fully disclosed payments from foreign sources and overseas trips when he renewed his Top Secret security clearance last year.

One focus of the probe is a June 2015 trip Flynn, a former general, took to Israel and Egypt to gauge interest in a plan floated by a group of scientists, consultants, and former military officers to build and provide security for dozens of nuclear power plants in the Middle East.

A promotional slide indicates that Rosoboron, a Russian state-owned arms exporter that is under U.S. sanctions, was to be part of the multi-billion dollar project.

In the letter, Democratic lawmakers argued that subpoenas were needed to determine whether Flynn was promoting the project while he was in the White House.

“We believe the paper trail must be pursued to answer the gravest question of all - did General Flynn seek to change the course of our country’s national security to benefit the same private interests he previously promoted,” the letter said.

Flynn is a central figure in a federal probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Donald Trump aides colluded with Russia to boost the Republican’s presidential campaign. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion.

Trump fired Flynn in February after a top Justice Department official warned that the former Defense Intelligence Agency director could be blackmailed because Moscow knew he made misleading statements about his contacts with Russian officials.

The Democrats also pointed to a discrepancy between Flynn’s financial disclosures and statements to the committee by the counsel for IronBridge Group, Inc. and IP3 Corp., two companies set up by former Navy Rear Admiral Michael Hewitt.

In an amended disclosure in August, Flynn said he served as an advisor to IronBridge from June 2016 to December 2016, a period that overlapped with his work on Trump’s presidential campaign and the post-election transition.

In contrast, the counsel for IP3 and IronBridge told the committee that the company tried to hire Flynn, but he never accepted the offer.",House Democrats seek documents on former Trump aide Michael Flynn,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-flynn/house-democrats-seek-documents-on-former-trump-aide-michael-flynn-idUSKBN1CN27B?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday.

China will push ahead with market-oriented reforms of its foreign exchange rate as well as its financial system, and let the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, Xi said at the opening of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress.

“China’s open door will not be closed, it will be only be opened wider,” Xi said.

The government will “clean up rules and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition, support development of private firms and stimulate vitality of all types of market entities,” Xi said, while pledging to further open China’s services sector to foreign investors.

However, while expressing support for market reform and private firms, Xi also called for stronger, bigger state firms.

The government will “promote strengthening, improvement and expansion of state capital, (and) effectively prevent loss of state assets, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises, development a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms,” Xi said.

Xi’s comments reiterated a long-standing pledge by party leaders to give a greater role to free-market forces to improve efficiency and put the economy on a more sustainable growth path.

But as Xi gears up for his second five-year term, foreign business executives and analysts increasingly believe market liberalization is seen as secondary to his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability.

Other painful reforms that many economists say are needed have also moved slowly under Xi. They include overhauling China’s bloated and debt-laden state sector, fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt and bringing in new property taxes to ward off housing bubbles.

LOWER GROWTH TARGETS?

China should also strengthen consumption as a foundation for economic development, Xi said, and will expand the middle class and narrow the gap in development between rural and urban areas.

Beijing’s campaign to rein in high debt levels and industrial overcapacity will continue as part of supply-side structural reforms, he added.

Xi also proposed a goal of developing China into a “basically” modernized, innovation-driven country by 2035 and a modern “strong power” by 2050.

But analysts said that suggests the government is likely to continue to target moderately high economic growth in coming years, which could see the country’s large debt pile climb even further.

China’s gross domestic income per capita would need to rise by an average of 6.6 percent a year in real U.S. dollar terms from 2017 onwards to become an “innovative economy” and match the development level of today’s South Korea by 2035, ANZ estimated.

That growth figure needs to be no lower than 4.9 percent for China to be a “modernized economy” - the by World Bank’s definition of high income countries - all the way to 2050, ANZ added.

“Nobody knows what is a ‘modernized country’, but from the wording of Xi Jinping you can tell what he would like to achieve is for China to be one of the high income countries today like Japan and Australia,” said Raymond Yeung, Great China Chief Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.

China is expected to post its strongest economic growth in several years this year, riding on a government-led construction boom, but economists said it is still relying too heavily on credit-fueled stimulus despite policymakers’ vows to reduce debt risks.

Some international agencies and economists have argued Beijing should abandon its arbitrary annual growth targets or lower it to become less reliant on government stimulus and bank credit. Less ambitious growth targets would also give policymakers more room for tougher reforms.

Specific economic targets for 2018 are likely to be set during an economic work meeting later this year, but are not expected to be announced until March.

The International Monetary Fund warned this year that China’s credit growth was on a “dangerous trajectory” and called for “decisive action”, while the Bank for International Settlements said in late 2016 that excessive debt growth was signaling a banking crisis in the next three years.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau appeared side-by-side in Toronto’s suburbs to announce the tax cut, highlighting their desire to get past what has become a major stumbling block as the Liberal government heads into the second half of its mandate.

“Powerful interests have benefited a lot from the current system, and they will fight hard to maintain the status quo. We knew that going in. But nothing will stop us from building an economy that works for more Canadians,” Trudeau said in a sometimes combative news conference.

Morneau, the former president of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell, also faced heat over his personal finances, with the Globe and Mail newspaper reporting that he had not put his personal holdings in a blind trust that would avoid conflicts of interest, as Trudeau did.

Answering reporters’ questions, Morneau said he had followed the advice of the Ethics Commissioner and that he would put his holdings in a blind trust if it is recommended.

While Trudeau has enjoyed a rosy profile on the world stage since his election in 2015, his honeymoon at home has ended, curtailed by the bungled tax reform and the election of a younger, hipper opposition leader who could steal away votes.

Pollster Nik Nanos said support for the Liberals had dropped 5 percentage points in the last four weeks, but the party remained about 5 points ahead of the Conservative opposition. The next election is in October 2019.

“The prime minister intervening (in the tax issue) is probably part of an attempt to reverse the negative trajectory,” said Nanos.

The government said the small business tax would be lowered to 10 percent effective Jan. 1, 2018, and to 9 percent in 2019.

Measures to limit access to the lifetime capital gains exemption that critics said hurt the ability of families to pass their business on to their children were abandoned.

Morneau’s three-pronged tax reform proposed in July, which affected those who sprinkled income among family members or used passive investment income in order to be taxed at a lower rate, sparked outrage among doctors, farmers and family businesses, and backbench Liberals have criticized the handling of the reform.","Under pressure over tax reform, Canada cuts small business tax",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CL1WI-OCADN

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Thousands of Somalis demonstrated on Wednesday against those behind bombings that killed more than 300 people, defying police who opened fire to keep them away from the site where their loved-ones were killed.

The twin blasts in the heart of Mogadishu on Saturday also injured more than 400 in what were the country’s deadliest truck bombings.

Police initially opened fire to prevent people from accessing the rubble-strewn scene of the attack, injuring at least two people, the emergency response service said. But, overwhelmed by the number of people, they eventually let thousands of protesters gather at the site.

Residents said they had never seen such a big protest in the city.

“We are demonstrating against the terrorists that massacred our people. We entered the road by force,” said Halima Abdullahi, a mother who lost six of her relatives in the attacks.

The Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which began an insurgency in 2007, has not claimed responsibility, but the method and type of attack - a large truck bomb - is increasingly used by the al Qaeda-linked organization.

Mohamed Ali, a police captain at the scene, said it was fine for protesters to access the site to express their grief.

“For some who could not see their relatives alive or dead, the only chance they have is to at least see the spot where their beloved were killed,” he told Reuters.

Later President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed addressed demonstrators at a football field in the city and called on Somalis to join the national army.

“Take your guns and let’s liberate our country. Come forward for recruitment (into) government forces in order to fight and eliminate al Shabaab,” he said.

The government buried at least 160 of those killed because they could not be identified after the blast.

Masked security officers kept an eye on the protest on foot and on motorbikes. Some protesters sat on police trucks waving sticks and chanting: “We do not want al Shabaab”.

The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have been steadily losing territory. But they retain the capacity to mount large bomb attacks.

Over the past three years, the number of civilians killed by insurgent bombings has steadily climbed as al Shabaab increases the size of its bombs.

In the central town of Dusamareb, residents also marched for several hours to protest against the bombings in Mogadishu and clerics called for the war on the militants to be stepped up.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Aamin Ambulances, said one pregnant demonstrator was evacuated from the Mogadishu protest after she developed complications.

“The other two were also demonstrating. They were injured by bullets which the police fired to disperse the demonstrators who wanted to enter the blast scene by force,” he said.",Somalis defy police to protest against deadly truck bombings,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-somalia-attacks-protests/somalis-defy-police-to-protest-against-deadly-truck-bombings-idUKKBN1CN13W?il=0

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

EU leaders will discuss Brexit at a summit on Thursday and Friday, when they will deliver a verdict on progress made in the talks so far. EU negotiators want “sufficient progress” to justify opening trade negotiations with Britain.

“At the moment, the assessment is it is not ‘sufficient’,” the German official said, but stressed that not all issues affecting the withdrawal of Britain in March 2019 needed to be fully resolved before discussing the future relationship.

“It is not the case that nothing has happened since the beginning of the negotiations,” the official added. “We think a lot has happened. On what is important to us, citizens rights, we’ve made a lot of progress. We are all in good spirits.”

Britain is keen to start discussions about a 2-year transition period after it leaves the EU at the end of March 2019 and a trade relationship afterwards.

But EU leaders have adopted what they call a “phased approach”. First the EU and Britain must reach agreement on the terms of their divorce -- a financial settlement, the rights of citizens and on Northern Ireland -- and talk about the transition and the future relationship only afterwards.

“We expect that the government leaders will give a strong signal for us to prepare internally for the second phase - the future relationship,” the German official said, adding:

“The big questions for the future between Britain and the European Union are much larger than these current arguments about finances. I think everyone is aware of that, and so I am confident we will come to a solution there.”

May said earlier on Wednesday Britain was working to win the best possible deal for when it leaves the EU but that government had to plan for every eventuality, including exiting without a deal.","Germany upbeat on Brexit negotiations, official says",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-germany/germany-upbeat-on-brexit-negotiations-official-says-idUKKBN1CN1UN?il=0

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo

(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s secret internal database for tracking bugs in its own software was broken into by a highly sophisticated hacking group more than four years ago, according to five former employees, in only the second known breach of such a corporate database.

The company did not disclose the extent of the attack to the public or its customers after its discovery in 2013, but the five former employees described it to Reuters in separate interviews. Microsoft declined to discuss the incident.

The database contained descriptions of critical and unfixed vulnerabilities in some of the most widely used software in the world, including the Windows operating system. Spies for governments around the globe and other hackers covet such information because it shows them how to create tools for electronic break-ins.

The Microsoft flaws were fixed likely within months of the hack, according to the former employees. Yet speaking out for the first time, these former employees as well as U.S. officials informed of the breach by Reuters said it alarmed them because the hackers could have used the data at the time to mount attacks elsewhere, spreading their reach into government and corporate networks.

“Bad guys with inside access to that information would literally have a ‘skeleton key’ for hundreds of millions of computers around the world,” said Eric Rosenbach, who was U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber at the time.

Companies of all stripes now are ramping up efforts to find and fix bugs in their software amid a wave of damaging hacking attacks. Many firms, including Microsoft, pay security researchers and hackers “bounties” for information about flaws – increasing the flow of bug data and rendering efforts to secure the material more urgent than ever.

In an email responding to questions from Reuters, Microsoft said: “Our security teams actively monitor cyber threats to help us prioritize and take appropriate action to keep customers protected.”

Sometime after learning of the attack, Microsoft went back and looked at breaches of other organizations around then, the five ex-employees said. It found no evidence that the stolen information had been used in those breaches.

Two current employees said the company stands by that assessment. Three of the former employees assert the study had too little data to be conclusive.

Microsoft tightened up security after the breach, the former employees said, walling the database off from the corporate network and requiring two authentications for access.

The dangers posed by information on such software vulnerabilities became a matter of broad public debate this year, after a National Security Agency stockpile of hacking tools was stolen, published and then used in the destructive “WannaCry” attacks against U.K. hospitals and other facilities.

After WannaCry, Microsoft President Brad Smith compared the NSA’s loss to the “the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,” and cited “the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities.”

Only one breach of a big database from a software company has been disclosed. In 2015, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation - which develops the Firefox web browser - said an attacker had gotten access to a database that included 10 severe and unpatched flaws. One of those flaws was then leveraged in an attack on Firefox users, Mozilla disclosed at the time.

In contrast to Microsoft’s approach, Mozilla provided extensive details of the breach and urged its customers to take action.

Mozilla Chief Business and Legal Officer Denelle Dixon said the foundation told the public about what it knew in 2015 “not only inform and help protect our users, but also to help ourselves and other companies learn, and finally because openness and transparency are core to our mission.”

The Microsoft matter should remind companies to treat accurate bug reports as the “keys to the kingdom,” said Mark Weatherford, who was deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when Microsoft learned of the breach.

FILE PHOTO: An advertisement about the Microsoft Cybercrime Center plays behind a window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. on May 15, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo

Like the Pentagon’s Rosenbach, Weatherford said he had not known of the Microsoft attack. Weatherford noted that most companies have strict security procedures around intellectual property and other sensitive corporate information.

“Your bug repository should be equally important,” he said.

ALARM SPREADS AFTER INTERNAL PROBE

Microsoft discovered the database breach in early 2013 after a highly skilled hacking group broke into computers at a number of major tech companies, including Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc.

The group, variously called Morpho, Butterfly and Wild Neutron by security researchers elsewhere, exploited a flaw in the Java programming language to penetrate employees’ Apple Macintosh computers and then move to company networks.

The group remains active as one of the most proficient and mysterious hacking groups known to be in operation, according to security researchers. Experts can’t agree about whether it is backed by a national government, let alone which one.

More than a week after stories about the breaches first appeared in 2013, Microsoft published a brief statement that portrayed its own break-in as limited and made no reference to the bug database.

“As reported by Facebook and Apple, Microsoft can confirm that we also recently experienced a similar security intrusion,” the company said on Feb. 22, 2013.

“We found a small number of computers, including some in our Mac business unit, that were infected by malicious software using techniques similar to those documented by other organizations. We have no evidence of customer data being affected, and our investigation is ongoing.”

Inside the company, alarm spread as officials realized the database for tracking patches had been compromised, according to the five former security employees. They said the database was poorly protected, with access possible via little more than a password.

Concerns that hackers were using stolen bugs to conduct new attacks prompted Microsoft to compare the timing of those breaches with when the flaws had entered the database and when they were patched, according to the five former employees.

These people said the study concluded that even though the bugs in the database were used in ensuing hacking attacks, the perpetrators could have gotten the information elsewhere.

That finding helped justify Microsoft’s decision not to disclose the breach, the former employees said, and in many cases patches already had been released to its customers.

Three of the five former employees Reuters spoke with said the study could not rule out stolen bugs having been used in follow-on attacks.

“They absolutely discovered that bugs had been taken,” said one. “Whether or not those bugs were in use, I don’t think they did a very thorough job of discovering.”

That’s partly because Microsoft relied on automated reports from software crashes to tell when attacks started showing up. The problem with this approach, some security experts say, is that most sophisticated attacks do not cause crashes, and the most targeted machines - such as those with sensitive government information - are the least likely to allow automated reporting.",Exclusive: Microsoft responded quietly after detecting secret database hack in 2013,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-cyber-insight/exclusive-microsoft-responded-quietly-after-detecting-secret-database-hack-in-2013-idUSKBN1CM0D0

The move by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is another headache for Kobe Steel, which has shocked aircraft, auto, train and other industries with its revelations that it has been shipping some products to customers with falsified data on strength and durability.

The U.S. Justice Department is also see eking information from Kobe Steel and has requested documentation on products the company has sold to U.S. buyers, Kobe Steel said earlier.

The Justice Department inquiry could significantly raise the stakes for the Japanese steelmaker, Daisuke Yuki, a lawyer at Nozomi Sogo Attorneys at Law said.

The Japan Civil Aviation Bureau is investigating the issue and gathering information from Japanese manufacturers and Kobe Steel, a spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday.

“Where alternative suppliers are available, it is recommended to suspend use of Kobe Steel products until the legitimacy of the affected parts can be determined,” EASA said in a Safety Information Bulletin (SIB) dated Oct. 17.

EASA said the concern was not serious enough at this stage to warrant any compulsory measures.

A Kobe Steel spokesman declined to comment on the EASA statement.

SUPPLY CHAIN CONCERNS

The admissions that Kobe Steel’s supply chains have been tainted, affecting about 500 companies across the world, has sent its shares into freefall. The tampering went back more than 10 years, a source told Reuters earlier this week.

The scandal puts another stain on Japan’s manufacturing prowess after similar cases including automakers Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T).

“All organizations that may have specified or used Kobe Steel products should do a thorough review of their supply chains in order to identify if, and when, Kobe Steel products have been used in their product designs and fabrications,” the SIB said.

Because the period of the data tampering has not been ascertained, the focus should be on “current production,” the agency said.

The world’s two largest planemakers, Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N), have already said they are conducting a review.

Kobe Steel will hold a first round of bidding on Friday in the sale of a real estate unit, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.

The company has hired Mizuho Securities, the brokerage arm of Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T), as an advisor for the sale of more than two-thirds of Shinko Real Esate, Bloomberg said, citing unidentified sources.

The Nikkei newspaper reported last week the sale may raise about 50 billion yen ($444 million).

Kobe Steel and Mizuho Securities declined to comment.

Mitsubishi Motor also said on Wednesday it is investigating how components from suppliers containing Kobe Steel parts have been affected by the data tampering.",Europe's aviation agency advises against using Kobe Steel products,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CN0XO-OCABS

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday.

China will push ahead with market-oriented reforms of its foreign exchange rate as well as its financial system, and let the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, Xi said at the opening of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress.

“China’s open door will not be closed, it will be only be opened wider,” Xi said.

The government will “clean up rules and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition, support development of private firms and stimulate vitality of all types of market entities,” Xi said, while pledging to further open China’s services sector to foreign investors.

However, while expressing support for market reform and private firms, Xi also called for stronger, bigger state firms.

The government will “promote strengthening, improvement and expansion of state capital, (and) effectively prevent loss of state assets, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises, development a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms,” Xi said.

Xi’s comments reiterated a long-standing pledge by party leaders to give a greater role to free-market forces to improve efficiency and put the economy on a more sustainable growth path.

But as Xi gears up for his second five-year term, foreign business executives and analysts increasingly believe market liberalization is seen as secondary to his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability.

Other painful reforms that many economists say are needed have also moved slowly under Xi. They include overhauling China’s bloated and debt-laden state sector, fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt and bringing in new property taxes to ward off housing bubbles.

LOWER GROWTH TARGETS?

China should also strengthen consumption as a foundation for economic development, Xi said, and will expand the middle class and narrow the gap in development between rural and urban areas.

Beijing’s campaign to rein in high debt levels and industrial overcapacity will continue as part of supply-side structural reforms, he added.

Xi also proposed a goal of developing China into a “basically” modernized, innovation-driven country by 2035 and a modern “strong power” by 2050.

But analysts said that suggests the government is likely to continue to target moderately high economic growth in coming years, which could see the country’s large debt pile climb even further.

China’s gross domestic income per capita would need to rise by an average of 6.6 percent a year in real U.S. dollar terms from 2017 onwards to become an “innovative economy” and match the development level of today’s South Korea by 2035, ANZ estimated.

That growth figure needs to be no lower than 4.9 percent for China to be a “modernized economy” - the by World Bank’s definition of high income countries - all the way to 2050, ANZ added.

“Nobody knows what is a ‘modernized country’, but from the wording of Xi Jinping you can tell what he would like to achieve is for China to be one of the high income countries today like Japan and Australia,” said Raymond Yeung, Great China Chief Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.

China is expected to post its strongest economic growth in several years this year, riding on a government-led construction boom, but economists said it is still relying too heavily on credit-fueled stimulus despite policymakers’ vows to reduce debt risks.

Some international agencies and economists have argued Beijing should abandon its arbitrary annual growth targets or lower it to become less reliant on government stimulus and bank credit. Less ambitious growth targets would also give policymakers more room for tougher reforms.

Specific economic targets for 2018 are likely to be set during an economic work meeting later this year, but are not expected to be announced until March.

The International Monetary Fund warned this year that China’s credit growth was on a “dangerous trajectory” and called for “decisive action”, while the Bank for International Settlements said in late 2016 that excessive debt growth was signaling a banking crisis in the next three years.

HOW IT UNFOLDEDFILE PHOTO: Chief Financial Officer of Rio Tinto, Guy Elliott, speaks during Russian Business Week 2011 at the London School of Economics in London February 18, 2011.","SYDNEY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday charged mining company Rio Tinto Plc (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and two of its former top executives with fraud, saying they inflated the value of coal assets in Mozambique and concealed critical information while tapping the market for billions of dollars.

The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also said on Tuesday it had reached a settlement with Rio Tinto under which the company would pay a fine of £27 million ($35.6 million) to settle claims that it breached accounting rules in connection with the Mozambique assets.

The Mozambican coal business, which relied on barging the product down the Zambezi River to port, was acquired for $3.7 billion in 2011 from Riversdale Mining and sold a few years later for $50 million.

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. federal court in Manhattan, the SEC said Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Thomas Albanese, and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record the assets.

The SEC said that soon after the deal was completed, Rio Tinto learned that the acquisition would yield less coal, and of a lower quality, than expected. The global miner could only transport and sell a fraction of the coal it had originally assumed, the SEC said.

By making misleading public statements, Rio Tinto and the executives were able to raise $5.5 billion from U.S. investors, the SEC said. They continued to solicit the investments even after executives of the Mozambique subsidiary told Albanese and Elliott that the unit was likely worth negative $680 million, according to the SEC.

“There is no truth in any of these charges,” Albanese said in a statement.

Christina Mills, a spokeswoman for Elliott, said Elliott would vigorously contest the charges.

Rio Tinto said it would defend itself vigorously against the SEC’s allegations. The company said the U.K. FCA had “made no findings of fraud, or of any systemic or widespread failure by Rio Tinto”.

HOW IT UNFOLDED

The SEC allegations are contained in court documents that also request a jury trial. The SEC said the rapid and dramatic decline in value of the coal business was concealed, in part because Rio Tinto had already disclosed huge losses in connection with its 2007 acquisition of Alcan.

“The Mozambique acquisition was expected to restore the market’s confidence in Albanese’s deal-making acumen, but on-the-ground realities in Mozambique quickly undermined that narrative,” the SEC said.

The SEC said the company knew its barging assumptions were unrealistic and railway capacity severely limited by the end of 2011, just months after securing the Riversdale assets.

“Defendants concealed the nature and extent of these adverse developments from Rio Tinto’s Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent auditors, and the market,” the SEC said.

The SEC said that if it had been disclosed, the developments would have triggered an impairment analysis. An impairment analysis would measure the difference in the expected cash flow from an asset and the value the company has booked the asset at.

By May 2012, Albanese and Elliott were informed of the negative $680 million valuation, although the company carried the assets on its books at more than $3 billion while also promoting its prospects to the market.

The SEC said the fraud continued until January 2013, when another executive discovered accounting irregularities. Albanese subsequently resigned and the value of the Mozambique assets were lowered by more than $3 billion.

The SEC is seeking to have Albanese and Elliott barred from acting as officers or directors of any public company.

The SEC also disclosed that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission was looking into Rio’s accounting of the Mozambique assets.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The value of overseas assets held by China’s centrally owned enterprises has exceeded 6 trillion yuan ($906.34 billion), with investments in more than 185 countries and regions, the state assets regulator said on Wednesday.

China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are spearheading investment in infrastructure projects overseas along the ancient Silk Road land and sea trade routes, part of Beijing’s signature Belt and Road initiative.

Firms owned by the central government have co-built 1,676 projects with countries along “the Belt and Road”, the state assets regulator said in a handout ahead of a news conference on the sidelines of the 19th Party Congress in Beijing.

SOEs such as shipping conglomerate COSCO (600428.SS) and the world’s biggest utility State Grid Corp of China [STGRD.UL] have invested heavily in such projects in recent years to deepen China’s links with economies throughout Asia and beyond.

“Overseas assets held by State Grid has reached $57.7 billion by now, all of which are profitable,” Shu Yinbiao, chairman of State Grid, said at the news conference.

But China has been increasingly scrutinising “irrational” overseas spending by both private and state-owned firms since late last year, which it suspected was one way of disguising capital flight as the yuan currency faltered.

The state assets regulator issued regulatory rules on outbound investments by centrally-controlled state firms early this year, saying it would establish a negative list of investment projects that centrally-controlled state firms would not be allowed to invest in.

NEAR DOUBLING OF ASSETS

Total assets held by China’s centrally-owned SOEs are expected to reach 55 trillion yuan ($8.31 trillion) in 2017, nearly doubling over the past five years, state-run China News Service reported on Wednesday, citing the state assets regulator.

China aims to create bigger, stronger state firms and build enterprises capable of competing globally while weeding out excessive capacity in bloated sectors without risking mass layoffs or a blow to economic growth.

“Assets owned by central government companies have exceeded 53 trillion yuan by now,” Hao Peng, party chief of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), was quoted as saying on the sidelines of congress.

Profits at those firms in the past five years totalled 6.4 trillion yuan, a more than 30 percent jump versus the previous five years, Hao said, according to China News Service.

China will prevent the loss of state assets, deepen reforms of state firms and develop a mixed-ownership economy, President Xi Jinping said at the opening of the twice-a-decade congress.

Xiao Yaqing, head of SASAC, said on Wednesday that SOE restructuring must be market-driven, but added that authorities will try to avoid layoffs.

“We hope there will be more restructuring and less bankruptcy...to have more job relocation and fewer layoffs,” Xiao said.

Central government-owned companies have also cut steel capacity by more than 16 million tonnes and coal capacity by more than 58 million tonnes during the past five years, Hao was quoted as saying.

The world’s top coal consumer and steel maker has launched a campaign to shut down substandard steel output in its war on pollution and industrial over-capacity.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.

“I don’t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.”

Trump’s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.

Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran’s state matters, welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.

“European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.”

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran’s compliance with the terms.

Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.

In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran’s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons.

Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.

EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran’s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.

“They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America’s bullying and its unreasonable demands,” Khamenei said.

“They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?”

The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran’s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans.

Iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.

“Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region,” Khamenei said.

Supporters of the deal fear Trump’s decision to decertify the deal could eventually unravel it, causing more tension in the crisis-hit Middle East, where Shi‘ite Iran is involved in a decades long proxy war with U.S. ally Sunni Saudi Arabia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the National Football League on Wednesday for not forcing players to stand for the national anthem, firing back after league officials meeting in New York chose instead to effectively back players’ right to political activism.

“Total disrespect for our great country!” tweeted Trump, who has repeatedly denounced players in the country’s most popular sports league as unpatriotic for kneeling during the anthem in a demonstration against racism.

After the first day of the NFL’s two-day autumn meeting of team owners, players and their union’s leaders in Manhattan, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters they talked about “the issues that our players have been trying to bring attention to. About issues in our communities to make our communities better.”

The small but growing number of players kneeling during the national anthem are protesting the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system. More than half of all NFL players are black.

Trump wants the league to suspend players if they kneel during pregame renditions of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” His vice president, Mike Pence, walked out of a stadium in Indianapolis this month as players knelt, which Trump said he had instructed Pence to do.

On Tuesday, Goodell appeared less interested in stifling the protests, despite the president’s views, and rather hailed the character of the players, saying that he wanted to help their political activism.

The commissioner said the league will meet again with players, probably in the next two weeks, and spend more time talking to reporters when the gathering concludes on Wednesday.",Trump slams NFL for not making players stand for anthem,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CN1JB-OCASP

Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc and the pro-business Free Democrats described their first talks on building a coalition government as constructive on Wednesday, but a meeting later with the Greens could prove more difficult.

Merkel, weakened by election losses last month, wants to forge an alliance between the bloc - her Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), but they differ on many policies.

Setting the stage for tough talks that could take several months, politicians from all parties have set out their stall, narrowing room for compromise in areas from immigration to the European Union and environmental policy.

After the first two-hour meeting, general secretaries from the two conservative parties and the FDP emerged, smiling, to tell reporters the talks had been positive.

“It was a good exchange, at times nice and above all mutually respectful and joyful,” said CSU General-Secretary Andreas Scheuer.

Merkel, whose conservatives bled support to the far right in the Sept. 24 election, warned her parliamentary party on Tuesday they would have to compromise.

Chancellor for 12 years and known as a skilled negotiator, she angered many voters over her open-door migrant policy and her conservatives saw their worst election result since 1949.

She has said she expects a government to be in place by Christmas, but others say January is more likely, pointing to a months-long policy standstill in Europe’s biggest economy.

The prospect of a minority government or new election hangs over the talks, a scenario Merkel wants to avoid due to fears the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could make bigger gains.

“It is totally conceivable that before Christmas or in January we say that the whole thing is pointless and we’ll talk to the Social Democrats (SPD),” Peter Ramsauer, a senior CSU member not on the negotiating team, told Deutschlandfunk.

The SPD, which suffered its worst result since 1933, has said it will go into opposition.

GREENS TOUGHER

A Jamaica coalition, so called because the parties’ black, yellow and green colours match those of the Caribbean nation’s flag, untested at the national level, is in place in the northern state of Schleswig Holstein but the first regional experiment, in Saarland, failed.

The conservative bloc is due to meet the Greens later on Wednesday.

“That’ll probably be a bigger, tougher task,” said Scheuer.

On Thursday, the FDP and Greens talk before all three parliamentary groups, involving more than 50 people, meet for the first time on Friday.

“The first steps on this path went well, in an objective, solution-oriented atmosphere,” said FDP General-Secretary Nicola Beer. “We agreed that some of us might need to be creative to continue on this path in this way.”

The talks are focused on building trust and agreeing a format for future talks rather than tackling hard policies.

CDU General-Secretary Peter Tauber, who described a “good feeling” at the talks, said: “Our clear goal is to have a good government for our country in the end.”

One of the toughest policy areas will be immigration.

Merkel, further weakened on Sunday by losses in a state election, has had to give way to the CSU on immigration, effectively bowing to a demand to limit the number of people allowed into Germany. That may be unacceptable to the Greens.

Merkel has spoken of a coalition that focuses on providing a sustainable social security system and has stressed the importance of investing in digital technology.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted prayers for Downie’s family, adding that “our hearts break on news of the passing of ... an ally and friend.”

Downie had become an outspoken supporter of Canada’s indigenous people, penning songs about the painful legacy of colonialism and urging Canadians toward reconciliation.

In their statement, Downie’s family said the singer had spent his last days making music and memories with family and friends.

“Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years - those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars,” the statement said.","Canada's Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie dies, PM weeps",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CN1XZ-OCADN

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, who are both in China and have not been taken into U.S. custody, were charged with conspiring to distribute large quantities of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues into the United States, the Justice Department said.

They were charged in separate indictments unsealed on Monday in Mississippi and North Dakota.

“For the first time, we have indicted major Chinese fentanyl traffickers who have been using the Internet to sell fentanyl and fentanyl analogues to drug traffickers and individual customers in the United States,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement.

An analogue is a drug that is chemically similar in makeup to another.

The United States does not have an extradition agreement with China.

Rosenstein said the department has talked to Chinese officials about the cases and plans to share the government’s evidence.

China must do more to crack down on labs making the drugs, he said. ”We believe that most, if not all, fentanyl that is distributed here in the U.S. and in Canada, originates in China,

he said.

Yan operated at least two chemical plants in China that were capable of illegally producing “ton quantities” of the drugs, and evaded detection by systematically altering their chemical makeup, the Justice Department said.

Investigators identified more than 100 distributors in the alleged scheme.

Zhang is accused of operating at least four labs in China and selling to U.S. customers over the internet. He is accused of sending “many thousands” of packages since January 2013, the government said.

Five Canadians, two residents of Florida and a resident of New Jersey were also charged in connection with the alleged conspiracy involving Zhang, the department said.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he did not know anything about this specific case, but added that the Chinese government took the fentanyl issue seriously and was continuing to cooperate with the United States to fight the illegal production and sale of fentanyl.

Earlier on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said his drug czar nominee, Republican U.S. Representative Tom Marino, had withdrawn his name from consideration.

Marino was cited in a Washington Post-CBS “60 Minutes” report on Sunday as spearheading legislation to neuter the Drug Enforcement Administration’s power to crack down on opioid manufacturers who were flooding the market with the addictive painkillers.

That report, however, involved legal prescription drugs that were illegally diverted.

The United States is dealing with a major epidemic of opioid overdoses. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic painkiller.

According to law enforcement officials, the drug is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.",U.S. indicts major Chinese traffickers for selling fentanyl online,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-opioid-indictments/u-s-indicts-major-chinese-traffickers-for-selling-fentanyl-online-idINKBN1CN18H

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Football Association made a public apology to England women’s football internationals Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence on Wednesday for discriminatory comments made to them by former manager Mark Sampson.

The apology came in a statement just as a parliamentary inquiry was beginning in London with senior FA officials facing questions over the investigations into Sampson’s alleged racism and bullying of Aluko.

Yet the statement also said that an investigation had concluded that Sampson, who was sacked by the FA last month for “inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour” in a previous job, was not racist.

The 35-year-old Sampson denies the allegations and was cleared of discrimination by two inquiries.

“On behalf of The Football Association I would like to sincerely apologise to Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence,” the FA’s chief executive Martin Glenn said in the statement.

Revealing the findings of independent barrister Katharine Newton’s reopened investigation into the claims, Glenn said she had found, after hearing new evidence, that Aluko and Spence had both been subject to discriminatory remarks made by Sampson.

“This is not acceptable,” he added.

”In her final report Katharine Newton concluded that on two separate occasions Mark Sampson made ill-judged attempts at humour, which as a matter of law were discriminatory on grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010.

“Katharine Newton did however conclude that Mark Sampson was not racist.”

The experienced international Aluko had claimed that Sampson had told her to be careful that her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus with them when they came to watch a game at Wembley.

Spence, a mixed-race player, alleged that after being called up to the England team in 2015 she was asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION

The statement also said that Newton had also concluded “there was no evidence to support the allegations that Eniola Aluko was subjected to ‘a course of bullying and discriminatory conduct’ by Mark Sampson.”

Aluko, who has been capped 102 times for England, has not played since making her claims last year.

The 30-year-old said she had suffered “victimisation” for speaking out about discrimination in the England team set-up.

She received around £80,000 from the FA, which said the settlement was to avoid the threat of an employment tribunal disrupting the England women’s team’s preparations for this year’s European Championships.

The FA had asked Newton to look at the issues again after complaints that key witnesses had not been interviewed.

“Our ambition has always been to find the truth and take swift and appropriate action if needed,” said the FA statement.

”It was our decision to have the original, second and final investigation to ensure that due diligence was taken.

“It is regrettable that Eniola did not participate in the first external investigation as this would have enabled Katharine Newton to conduct and complete her investigation sooner.”",FA apologises to women internationals Aluko and Spence,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-women/fa-apologises-to-women-internationals-aluko-and-spence-idUKKBN1CN1Y1

He also denied that their child had been murdered, but acknowledged that one child became sick and died.

“We were in a remote areas without access to a doctor and medications that led the loss of the child,” he said.

His latest full-length feature, ""Ajji"" (Grandmother), is the dark tale of an old woman who sets out to avenge the rape of her granddaughter.

Makhija tells Reuters why “Ajji” is about urban privilege and how the making of the film took a toll on his health.

Q: One of the big themes that emerge out of “Ajji” is urban privilege. Why was that important?

A: I don’t know if you have seen my short films, but I do this in all my stories. Not only because I feel guilty being born into a middle-class family and having three meals a day, but because I have actively travelled in tribal areas. When I came to Mumbai, I stayed in a slum for the first two years. I have actively tried to understand inequality, because inequality manifests in injustice. The law, though it says it is equal for all, everyone cannot access it. In all my stories, I try to remind those who have a little privilege that you are having it easy and there is someone out there who is not.

Q: How did you end up living in a slum?

A: I am from Calcutta. I was a journalist for a bit, in advertising for a bit, and I just couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do. I had a few friends who knew videography and they said, “Come here”. I came to Mumbai and lived in a slum rehabilitation colony. I didn’t have a choice – I didn’t have too much money. My mum had just passed and I had walked away from life as I knew it. Living there, I started questioning my life as it had been up until then.

The first film I worked on was ""Black Friday"". Even during the research of that film, we worked in the ghettos like Behrampada, Navpada. We lived in those areas for days and that just set me on a journey I couldn’t turn back from. I have taken it upon myself to put these people in all my stories - to tell stories about them because they are not represented in the mainstream.

I could have made “Ajji” more arthouse than it actually is. But somewhere in its story-telling, I tried to make it accessible. I tried to keep the thrill and drama going because I want the mainstream to watch it so that they will think about the other sections of society.

Q: What have you learned about the “other sections”?

Handout still from the movie ""Ajji""

A: There’s nothing that I learned from them. The more time I spend in strata and milieus that I don’t belong to, the more I learn about us. The fact that we take too much for granted. We feel wronged about being shortchanged while buying a pair of shoes. And over there is a grandmother whose granddaughter had her life taken from her as she knew it. She will never be the same again. That level of shortchange doesn’t compare to this. There is such a dichotomy and we understand life at such a different level... we operate at such a different frequency.

Q: Does it frustrate you as a film-maker that we don’t see too many of these subjects in the mainstream?

A: No, it doesn’t. And I try and not be arrogant about it. This film, even though it was made at a frighteningly low budget of 1.2 crores (12 million rupees), is still one point two crores, the kind of money I will never see at one go in my lifetime. And I am using someone else’s money to make my film. If someone is giving you money, they don’t want you to hold a mirror to them. They want to escape somewhere else. I get that and I have no sour grapes about that.

Q: How did you come up with the character of Ajji, the protagonist in your film?

A: Ajji was a response to a lot of things, (like) the constant reportage of rape after Nirbhaya. After a point, the film goes beyond rape and revenge. It is about all these inequalities. I had an idea about the most unlikely candidate in a family who would go out and do something about this. And the answer was the grandmother. And we made it even harder for her – we gave her arthritis, we made her live in a milieu where the patriarchy is so systemic that you don’t even realise it’s there until something gets out of hand. The truth of rape-revenge is so universal that I knew that if I make it dramatic enough, I’ll have the audience. The question was - how do I throw in all the other things that I wanted to talk about. That is how Ajji emerged.

Q: Your villain is completely despicable. Did he have to be that way for the film to work?

A: That’s a fair question. But like I said, in that milieu, the patriarchy is 5,000 years old. I was trying to distill that thought process into a person. Dhawale is not a person, but a thought process, and because it is so powerful, he had to be that way.

Q: You said that the making of the film affected your health.

A: (Pauses). I finally feel ready to talk about it. All of last year, during the making of the film, I started hating on my own masculinity. I was in prep in September last year when I started urinating blood. I was in severe pain and thought I wouldn’t be able to shoot. A doctor at the Hinduja Hospital thought it was prostate cancer. I shot on medication and as I went into post-production, I started healing myself. I met a few alternate healers who told me that I was hating on my own masculinity and the prostate gland is really the seat of the male hormone. In retrospect, I think in the making of the film, I sort of went through what Manda (the granddaughter) did. I could feel what Manda was feeling, what Ajji was feeling, because I was in so much pain, and it probably manifested on screen.",Q&A: Devashish Makhija on 'Ajji' and urban privilege,https://in.reuters.com/article/india-bollywood-ajji-devashish-makhija/qa-devashish-makhija-on-ajji-and-urban-privilege-idINKBN1CN1MG

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Wednesday named control of the interior ministry as its price for joining a future coalition government following its strong showing in a parliamentary election.

The anti-immigrant, anti-Islam FPO won around 26 percent of votes cast in Sunday’s election. The conservative People’s Party (OVP) won most votes by also taking a hard line on immigration, while the centre-left Social Democrats took second place.

Asked if the FPO would stick by its pre-election insistence that it would only join a future coalition if its candidate became interior minister, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told reporters: “Yes.”

“We won’t go down on our knees for anyone. At 26 percent we naturally aim to implement our (FPO) policies in government,” Strache added.

The interior ministry in Austria oversees asylum claims and the fight against terrorism, among other responsibilities.

Austria’s president will on Friday formally ask Sebastian Kurz, leader of the OVP, the largest party at around 32 percent, to start negotiations on forming a new coalition government.

The OVP and the FPO overlap in their plans to curb immigration, cut social benefits for refugees, reduce the tax burden on companies and work towards repatriating powers to national governments from Brussels while strengthening external border security.

SPURNING SOCIAL DEMOCRATS

All parties have kept their coalition options open, but the Social Democrats (SPO) are technically still bound by a party conference decision from 2014 that bans it from entering into a coalition government with the Freedom Party.

Slideshow (4 Images)

Under Austria’s outgoing Social Democrat chancellor, Christian Kern, the SPO has opened up significantly to the Freedom Party by introducing a so-called “value compass” for potential partners which does not specifically rule out working with the Freedom Party.

But Strache said on Wednesday that as long as there was no fresh vote among the Social Democrats’ base to formally annul the 2014 decision, talk of his party teaming up with the SPO was “theoretical”.

Influential FPO official Manfred Haimbuchner told newspaper Der Standard that he definitely preferred his party to form a government with the conservatives.

The FPO was founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s and first became a major political force in the 1990s under the charismatic Joerg Haider, who praised Hitler’s employment policies.

Today the party says it has put its Nazi past behind it and purged its ranks of anti-Semitism but still frequently has to expel members for anti-Semitic comments. It has, however, stopped calling for Austria to leave the European Union.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - O Ministério Público Federal (MPF) apresentou denúncia nesta quarta-feira contra o ex-presidente do Comitê Olímpico do Brasil (COB) Carlos Arthur Nuzman por corrupção, organização criminosa, lavagem de dinheiro e evasão de divisas por suspeita de compra de votos na eleição que escolheu o Rio de Janeiro como sede dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016.

Além de Nuzman, também foram denunciados o ex-diretor de marketing do COB Leonardo Gryner, por corrupção e organização criminosa, e o ex-governador Sérgio Cabral, o empresário Arthur Soares e os senegaleses Papa Massata Diack e Lamine Diack, por corrupção, informou o MPF.

Nuzman foi preso pela Polícia Federal em 5 de outubro acusado de intermediar a compra de votos de dirigentes africanos, por meio dos Diack, na eleição realizada pelo Comitê Olímpico Internacional (COI) em 2009, com dinheiro proveniente do esquema de corrupção liderado pelo então governador Cabral, que também está preso.

Nuzman renunciou à presidência do COB, que comandava há 22 anos, após a prisão. Gryner também foi preso pela PF na mesma operação, mas recebeu direito à liberdado posteriormente.

Segundo a denúncia, os dirigentes esportivos e o então governador viabilizaram pagamento de 2 milhões de dólares do empresário Soares aos senegaleses para garantir a vitória do Rio de Janeiro.

O Rio foi eleito sede dos Jogos Olímpicos em uma votação em que derrotou Chicago, Tóquio e Madri. Na votação final, contra a cidade espanhola, a candidatura carioca obteve um triunfo com margem folgada, 66 votos a 32.

Para o MPF, Nuzman e Gryner são equiparados a funcionários públicos, porque tanto o COB como o Comitê Rio 2016, responsável pela organização dos Jogos, eram gestores de verbas públicas recebidas pelas instituições e exerciam atividade típica de Estado, o esporte.

“A despeito de tratar-se de uma ‘pessoa jurídica de direito privado’, o Comitê Olímpico do Brasil, por meio de seus dirigentes, representa a República Federativa do Brasil em eventos esportivos internacionais, recebe verba pública (que representa a maior parte de seu orçamento) e, ainda, exerce uma atividade típica da Administração Pública Federal ao fomentar e organizar as atividades desportivas olímpicas no Brasil”, disseram os procuradores do MPF na denúncia.

“Onde existe verba pública, existe dever de probidade e existe a responsabilidade daqueles que a gerem, podendo, portanto, ser responsabilizados quando atuarem em contrariedade ao que determina a lei.”

Procurada, a defesa de Nuzman não tinha um posicionamento de imediato sobre a apresentação da denúncia. Não foi possível fazer contato com representantes dos outros denunciados.

Nuzman, que também foi o presidente do Comitê Rio 2016, teve bens bloqueados pela Justiça Federal e foi proibido de sair do país até a conclusão das investigações da chamada operação Unfair Play, que resultou em bloqueio de ativos de suspeitos no total de 1 bilhão de reais.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it would push the United Nations Security Council to renew within days an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, setting the stage for a likely showdown with Russia.

Russia has questioned the work and future of the joint inquiry by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and said it would decide whether to support extending the mandate after investigators submit their next report.

The inquiry, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), is due to report by Oct. 26 on who was responsible for an April 4 attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people.

“We would like to see it renewed prior to the report coming out,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley told reporters.

“The Russians have made it very clear that should the report blame the Syrians suddenly they won’t have faith in the JIM. If the report doesn’t blame the Syrians then they say that they will. We can’t work like that,” Haley said.

A separate OPCW fact-finding mission determined in June that the banned nerve agent sarin had been used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack, which prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base.

Haley said she would circulate a draft resolution to the 15-member Security Council later on Wednesday to renew the mandate for the JIM, which is due to expire in mid-November. It was unanimously created by the council in 2015 and renewed in 2016.

A resolution must get nine votes in favor and not be vetoed by any of the council’s five permanent members - Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France - in order to pass.

The JIM has found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during a civil war that has lasted more than six years.

Mikhail Ulyanov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s non-proliferation and arms control department, said on Friday there were “serious problems” with the work of the inquiry.

“In order to judge if it deserves an extension of the mandate, we need to see the report ... and assess it,” Ulyanov told a briefing at the United Nations to present Moscow’s view on the “Syrian chemical dossier.”","U.S., Russia set for likely U.N. row over Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicalweapons/u-s-russia-set-for-likely-u-n-row-over-syria-toxic-gas-inquiry-idUSKBN1CN29T?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top U.S. bankers are still hoping that President Trump’s administration will make policy changes to boost profits, but made clear in public comments in recent days that they are not seeing any signs of progress so far.

Optimism about tax cuts, infrastructure investment and an unwind of costly financial regulations sent bank stocks soaring after the November 2016 presidential election that ushered Donald Trump into the White House.

THE KBW bank stock index .BKX rose 28 percent through the end of February. Since then, however, the index has risen only another 2.7 percent, less than the rise in the broader stock market.

In reporting third-quarter earnings, executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) said Trump’s actions so far have not driven business activity or expense reductions.

“These things are great – if and when they happen – but they’re not embedded in any of our plans,” Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez said about the idea of changing financial regulations on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.

His comments echoed those of his JPMorgan counterpart, Marianne Lake, who said last week that discussing tax reform with clients is like “talking about a hypothetical at this point.”

The White House unveiled a nine-page tax “framework” in late-September that called for cutting the corporate tax rate, among other things, but it is unclear if or how Congress will actually adapt it into law.

Nonetheless, bankers said the pro-business tone from Washington has been encouraging after a long period of anti-Wall Street sentiment and increasingly tough regulations.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said tax reform, higher interest rates, and regulatory changes could drive bank profits higher over the longer term, while Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said he likes the direction the Trump administration is taking, even if policy changes remain uncertain.

In presentations for investors, some analysts asked bank executives if slower commercial and industrial loan growth was a result of uncertainty in Washington, but executives said that was not the case.

GENNEVILLIERS, France (Reuters) - In Gennevilliers, a communist-held suburb on the Paris outskirts, President Emmanuel Macron’s promises to help the poor are met with scorn.

It was in this drab working-class neighborhood that the former investment banker launched his anti-poverty plan this week as he struggles to shake off the tag of “president of the rich”.

Unemployment here is above the national average and one in four people live in poverty. Macron pledges to overhaul professional training to get the jobless back to work quicker. He has also announced increased disability allowances, a revamp of social housing, and the phasing-out of an unpopular housing tax.

Yet his plans to assist poorer households have been eclipsed by reforms widely perceived as favoring the rich and investors, including the scrapping of a wealth tax and a cut in corporate tax.

Nathalie and Pascal Dilard were forced to give up their flat after they lost their jobs. With their teenage son, they now reside with Pascal’s elderly parents, living off 400 euros a month.

“Anti-poverty? I‘m sorry, but when I see our situation, that makes me laugh,” Nathalie, 50, said as anti-riot police pushed back protesting unionists during Macron’s visit.

“My problem with him is that he helps the rich, not the little people like us. We can just die,” she said.

Six months into his presidency, Macron, 39, is moving fast with his drive to re-shape France’s social and economic model.

That has won him praise from international investors, euro zone allies and billionaires such as Bernard Arnault, the head of luxury giant LVMH, who say his pro-business policies will win new investments and create jobs.

But in a country whose “soul is equality”, as former president Francois Hollande once said, and whose tax and welfare systems have produced lower levels of inequality than in Britain or the united States, Macron’s reforms have angered left-wing opponents, unions and workers.

TRICKLE-DOWN

Commentators have likened Macron’s policies to the “trickle-down” economics espoused by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and Britain’s Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher. They believed tax cuts for the rich would benefit the poor through increased consumption and investment.

Macron on Sunday rejected trickle-down economics, opting instead for a rock-climbing analogy whereby he wanted “lead climbers” to be strong enough to haul up those behind.

The measures planned for the next five years will increase the living standards of the poorest 10 percent by 2.1 percent, while the richest 10 percent will be 1.2 percent better off by 2022, according to a French Treasury study.

Slideshow (6 Images)

The only segment of the population that will be marginally worse off is the upper middle class, it said.

But according to the OFCE economic think-tank, that will translate into a 700 euros per year income increase for the richest 10 percent, while the poorest 10 percent will be less than 200 euros better off.

Former Harvard university economist Philippe Aghion, who helped shape Macron’s economic program, said “Macronomics” was more akin to the Scandinavian model because of the place given to state investment in training and education.

Nonetheless Macron’s reforms have re-ignited the debate about redistribution between rich and poor and reveal a weak public confidence that the measures will bring investments beneficial for the whole economy, said the Eurointelligence think-tank.

”You will never motivate the French people with ‘competitiveness’. “You will always motivate them with ‘grands projets’,” said economist Christian Saint-Etienne, referring to large-scale undertakings such as France’s post-war state investment in high-speed trains, planes and nuclear plants.

In Gennevilliers, two retirees bemoaned Macron’s intention of increasing a social welfare tax on pensions.

“My husband worked 50 hours a week from the age of 15. And now they tell us you pensioners are getting too much in retirement!” said one of them, 63-year-old Lisianne Jouvenaux.","In working class Paris suburb, 'Macronomics' falls flat",https://www.reuters.com/article/france-macron/in-working-class-paris-suburb-macronomics-falls-flat-idINKBN1CN2AQ?il=0

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who reached the agreement with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, said Trump had “completely engineered” the proposal.

The agreement would provide billions of dollars of subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Trump last week announced he would end the subsidies, potentially creating chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.

“I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O‘Care,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

In another setback, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan indicated no interest in the Alexander-Murray agreement.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

While the proposal drew broad Democratic support, it remained unclear whether the agreement will even come to a vote in the Senate and House, both controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority but other than Alexander, Susan Collins and John McCain are the only Republican senators who have publicly embraced the plan.

On Tuesday, Trump had indicated support of the agreement during a news conference, saying the White House had been involved in the negotiations and that the agreement would be a “short-term solution” that would “get us over this intermediate hump.”

During Tuesday’s news conference, he also made clear that he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and that he still considered the subsidies a government handout that had enriched insurance companies.

He also told a conservative think thank, “While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray ... I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

The Trump administration followed through on the president’s plan to end the subsidies and did not make a payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to insurers that had been scheduled for Wednesday.

MORE FLEXIBILITY

The Alexander-Murray proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The subsidies compensate private insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses for low-income customers. They are known as cost-sharing reduction payments.

At an event sponsored by the news website Axios shortly before Trump posted his tweet on Wednesday, Alexander said, “Trump completely engineered the plan that we announced yesterday.”

“He wanted a bipartisan bill for the short term,” Alexander added.

Collins, a moderate who helped kill earlier Senate efforts to repeal and replace the healthcare law, said she did not know if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would schedule a vote but told CNN, “If it comes to the floor, I think the votes are there.”

The president’s move last week to discontinue subsidies was part of his effort to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through executive actions because his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Trump said on Tuesday he wanted lawmakers, once they have completed work on his tax-cut proposal, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Republicans, describing Obamacare as ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy, have sought for seven years to repeal and replace it. Scrapping the law was also a top Trump campaign pledge.

Democrats have fought to defend Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.

Republicans in Congress could face political risks if they fail to act on healthcare.

LONDON (Reuters) - PCP Capital Partners, the investment firm run by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, is interested in bidding around $400 million for Newcastle United after owner Mike Ashley put the Premier League club up for sale on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Speculation over Staveley’s interest in the St James’ Park club was sparked when she was seen at the ground watching a match earlier this month against Liverpool, another club she has been linked with buying in the past.

PCP Capital, which acts for investors in the Middle East and China, is one of four potential bidders for the club, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. PCP is best known for acting as an intermediary between Barclays and a group of Abu Dhabi investors during the 2008 financial crisis, helping the British bank avoid a government bailout.

Newcastle United did not respond to requests for comment.

PCP, which has not yet put in an offer for Newcastle United, believes the club is worth around 300 million pounds ($395.25 million) with a further 150 million pounds needed to invest in players over the next two years, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal is not public.

The club has said they were willing to listen to offers that would be capable of “delivering sustained investment” towards achieving their ambitions in the top flight.

Newcastle have been relegated twice since Ashley took charge in 2007. After winning promotion back to the Premier League last season, Rafael Benitez’s side are ninth in the standings with 11 points from eight games.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s economics ministry said it is “deeply concerned” about the antitrust agency imposing a $775 million fine on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), in a rare public display of disagreement between authorities.

Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) fined Qualcomm last week, saying the U.S. chipmaker had abused its monopolistic position by opting against licensing some modem-related technologies to other industry players.

Qualcomm said it disagreed and would take the matter to court once the agency releases a final report in coming weeks.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees industrial policy, said it respected the agency’s position but was concerned about any impact on foreign investment.

“With regards to the investigation and judgment process... our ministry is deeply concerned,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday.

“Considering economic stability and prosperity, as well as that the economics ministry is the government authority overseeing industry, the ministry would like to see better coordination between industrial development and fair trading.”

The ministry said the agency did not appear to take into account Qualcomm’s contribution to the overall local technology industry or impact on future business opportunities, describing the U.S. firm as an “indispensable partner”.

The FTC did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) supported the FTC’s action in a statement on Oct. 12, reiterating views of some industry players that it would lead to a fairer business environment for technological innovation.

The action is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing patents related to installation and use.

(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines Inc (IBM.N) surged 9 percent on Wednesday after it beat expectations on revenue and gave an outlook that hinted one of the world’s first big computing names was back on a growth track after six years in retreat.

There was no initial sign of changes to major brokerage ratings and most analysts shied away from calling a complete turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

But both Citi and Barclays raised their price targets for the stock, helping it towards its biggest daily percentage gain since 2009 -- a stark contrast with a nearly 12 percent fall so far this year.

The rise in the share price, last at $159.79, added $12.6 billion to the company’s market value and accounted for nearly 90 of the 105 point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday.

“After a difficult first half, IBM turned in a solid quarter last night and we continue to believe the company will emerge from this transition a much stronger IT organization,” Drexel Hamilton Brian White wrote in a client note.

He has a “buy” rating on the stock and a $200 price target.

Another analyst, Jefferies John DiFucci, argued that while IBM has struggled more than peers such as Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to adjust to a changing market, the quarterly performance of its software business was noteworthy.

He warned against reading across from the firm’s results to others in the sector.

“IBM has historically served as an indicator of overall software industry health, and as the world’s 3rd largest software vendor, its results are relevant,” he said.

“But we caution against direct read-throughs to other companies in recent times due to company-specific and secular challenges IBM has faced.”

Revenue at the company, one of the world’s original PC producers but now a broad-based producer, integrator and software maker, has fallen for 22 straight quarters.

Weak demand from customers had left its legacy hardware and software businesses stagnating.

The results showed revenue from IBM’s cloud, cybersecurity and data analytics business rose 11 percent to $8.8 billion in the quarter, accounting for about 46 percent of total revenue.

The company’s software revenue also grew for the first time after 13 consecutive quarters of declines.

“We were pleased to see the quality of IBM’s earnings improve, with IP income and taxes being less of a driver of upside than in prior quarters,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note.

But she added: “We see the business as secularly challenged due to its high exposure to a legacy business model, and see continued margin pressure over the long-term as IBM’s business is pressured by competition from lower-cost offerings and the cloud.”

Out of 25 analysts covering the stock, only 6 have a “buy” or higher rating, 15 are on “hold”, and 4 have a “sell” or lower. They have a median price target of $154.50.

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

As the Senate opened debate on a fiscal year 2018 budget, Senator Rand Paul objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs.

“I will not vote for the budget unless it keeps within the spending caps,” the Republican senator told reporters. In a conversation with Trump earlier on Tuesday, Paul said he told the Republican president: “I‘m all in. I want to be supportive. I‘m a ‘yes’ vote. But we have to obey our own rules.”

Senate Republican aides denied that the budget resolution exceeds federal spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Paul said the excess spending was for overseas military operations, which aides said are not subject to caps.

The budget resolution already had a narrow path to passage in the Senate, where Democrats oppose the measures and Republicans have only a 52-48 majority. A “no” vote from Paul appeared to put the budget a single vote from failure, threatening to upend Trump’s drive for tax reform.

Another fiscal hawk, Senator Ted Cruz, has refused to disclose whether he would support the measure.

However, the Republican odds of passing a budget resolution improved unexpectedly when Senator Thad Cochran returned to the Senate despite an illness and said in a statement that he looked forward to “taking part in the debate on the budget and tax cuts.” A day earlier, Cochran’s office had said he would not be available this week.

With Cochran in the Senate, Republicans can pass the measure even if they lose two votes.

The budget resolution is essential to Trump’s tax reform strategy because it would unlock a legislative tool known as reconciliation, which would allow Senate Republicans to pass a tax bill with a simple majority. Without it, a partisan tax bill would need 60 votes in the 100-member Senate and would almost certainly fail.

The Republican effort had gained momentum on Monday when two other potential Senate Republican “no” votes - Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski - indicated they were leaning toward “yes.” Senator John McCain also said he would support the budget resolution.

After failing to overturn Obamacare earlier this year, Republicans fear they will face a backlash from constituents in next year’s congressional midterm elections if they are unable to pass legislation to cut taxes for businesses and individuals.

Trump and top Republicans have proposed a plan to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years as part of a reform package that they say will boost economic growth and provide more jobs and higher wages.

Democrats, who criticize the Republican plan as a giveaway to the wealthy, will likely propose numerous amendments to the budget plan to prevent tax cuts for the rich and require legislation that would not expand the federal deficit.

“We’re talking about a major political party now working night and day on behalf of the top 0.1 percent,” Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told Reuters on Tuesday.

Several members of May’s party are expected to side with the opposition Labour Party during a symbolic debate in parliament and demand a halt to the implementation of a new welfare payment system, which has been dogged by design problems.

May leads a minority government, propped up by a small Northern Irish party, faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the European Union - which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation.

Wednesday’s debate, although it cannot force the government to act, could show how hard that will be if members of her own party are willing to speak out against her government.

Earlier this month, Conservative lawmaker Heidi Allen and 13 others - enough to defeat May with the support of opposition parties - wrote to the government calling for the welfare reform to be dropped.

“Today’s a big day. It feels like a bit of a crescendo,” Allen told the government’s welfare minister, David Gauke, at a parliamentary committee meeting before the debate. She then raised a string of concerns about the policy.

Allen and other potential rebels were reported to have met May on Tuesday to try to broker a compromise. The government could head off a public rebellion by allowing the Labour motion to pass without a formal vote.

“The social security system is meant to protect people from debt and arrears, not exacerbate their situation,” said Labour lawmaker Debbie Abrahams. “We must stand together to make our voices heard ... I urge Conservative MPs (members of parliament) to vote with their conscience and support our motion.”

The welfare reform, known as “Universal Credit”, is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one.

The policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under May’s predecessor David Cameron, but the expansion of the programme to more people has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens.

The government is pressing ahead with the latest phase of the programme despite concerns voiced by MPs from all parties that claimants must wait six weeks for payment. The government says they have taken measures to stop this happening.",MPs to vent anger at May's fragile government over welfare reform,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics/mps-to-vent-anger-at-mays-fragile-government-over-welfare-reform-idUKKBN1CN1FF

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.

“I don’t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.”

Trump’s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.

Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran’s state matters, welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.

“European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.”

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran’s compliance with the terms.

Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.

In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran’s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons.

Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.

EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran’s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.

“They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America’s bullying and its unreasonable demands,” Khamenei said.

“They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?”

The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran’s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans.

Iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.

“Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region,” Khamenei said.

Supporters of the deal fear Trump’s decision to decertify the deal could eventually unravel it, causing more tension in the crisis-hit Middle East, where Shi‘ite Iran is involved in a decades long proxy war with U.S. ally Sunni Saudi Arabia.

If the deal falls apart, Iran’s anti-Western hardliners will gain authority in a backlash against pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani, who engineered the accord to help end Iran’s political and economic isolation, analysts and insiders say.",Khamenei says Iran will 'shred' nuclear deal if U.S. quits it,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-khamenei/khamenei-says-iran-will-shred-nuclear-deal-if-u-s-quits-it-idUSKBN1CN167

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed above the 23,000-mark in late morning trading on Wednesday with solid support from IBM, which reported strong earnings.

Shares of IBM (IBM.N) surged 9 percent and accounted for nearly 92 of the 136 point gain in the blue-chip index, after the company signaled it was back on growth path.

The Dow had briefly surpassed the all-time peak on Tuesday but closed 3 points short of the record level. The latest 1,000-point increase was covered in roughly half the time it took the index to move from 21,000 to 22,000.

Solid earnings and hopes that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax cuts have helped the market rally this year.

“We continue to see solid numbers above expectations, stability in terms of economic growth and global growth,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.

“Announcements by the ECB next week and decision by the Fed in December will probably have a higher impact on whether or not we continue this rally.”

The dollar climbed higher, tracking higher U.S. Treasury yields, while news on a potential new hawkish Federal Reserve chair and the slow progress of U.S. tax reforms also supported the greenback. [USD/]

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has succeeded in pushing trade onto the agenda of the European Union summit which starts on Thursday, calling for caution in commercial deals that would bring a surge of beef and other agricultural imports.

France has led a group of 11 countries calling on the European Commission, which negotiates trade agreements on behalf of EU nations, not to rush into a deal with the Mercosur bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.

Macron said last week that France was in no hurry to a deal with Mercosur by the end of the year, a goal the Commission has set, noting that the mandate dates back to 1999.

France’s ambassador to Brazil said on Monday that France would propose changing that mandate to include food safety provision. However, officials said on Wednesday that the mandate was not up for discussion - at least for now.

Trade will, however, be squeezed between the leaders’ dinner discussions on foreign policy and Brexit, in an agenda described by one EU diplomat as “very full”.

EU officials said Macron was concerned the Commission was “running too fast” towards a deal with Mercosur, as it plans to open up talks with Australia and New Zealand, two other countries that want to expand exports of farm products.

EU lawmakers last week backed the start of such free trade talks, while warning negotiators should be cautious about allowing in produce such as butter and beef.

Macron, EU officials said, believed in free trade but wanted to tread carefully. France needed to learn more on the Commission’s plan for Australia and New Zealand talks and on whether each set of talks should be split.

An EU court ruling in May opened the door for trade deals to be split in two - one on major parts of market opening that could be fast-tracked and a second centered on investment that would need to wait for approval by national parliaments.

Some EU states are concerned that national parliaments remain involved in the process.

One EU diplomat forecast an “interesting” discussion going beyond just the Mercosur talks, with some countries clearly wanting to accelerate deals and others more concerned about the impact of globalization and parts of society put at risk by increased trade.",Not so fast: France's Macron and his farmers get trade onto 'full' EU agenda,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-summit-trade/not-so-fast-frances-macron-and-his-farmers-get-trade-onto-full-eu-agenda-idUSKBN1CN28M

Appealing for information to help identify the conman, Branson said he suspected the same person had later impersonated him to steal $2 million from a friend of his by pretending to raise funds for people affected by Hurricane Irma.

“This story sounds like it has come straight out of a John le Carre book or a James Bond film, but it is sadly all true,” Branson wrote in a blog.

Instantly recognizable with his wavy blond hair and beard, Branson is one of Britain’s best-known businessmen. The Virgin brand is licensed for use by a range of businesses from airlines to train companies to telecoms and gyms.

Branson wrote that six months ago, after an elaborate set-up involving a note on fake government notepaper, he spoke on the phone to someone purporting to be Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

The man told Branson that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom by terrorists.

He said that while the government did not pay ransoms, there was a particularly sensitive reason why the diplomat had to be saved, and the government was confidentially asking a syndicate of British business people to step in.

“I was asked to contribute $5 million of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back,” Branson wrote.

Feeling suspicious, Branson checked with the government and was told that Fallon had not spoken to him. The matter was reported to the police.

Six months on, Branson learnt that a friend, whom he described as a very successful businessman in the United States, had been called by a conman posing as him.

“When the call happened, the conman did an extremely accurate impression of me and spun a big lie about urgently needing a loan while I was trying to mobilize aid in the BVI (British Virgin Islands),” he wrote.

Branson owns a small island in the BVI archipelago which, as was well publicized, was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The caller took advantage of that context.

“They claimed I couldn’t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn’t have any communications going to Europe and I’d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America,” Branson wrote.

“The business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2 million, which promptly disappeared.”

A spokesman for Fallon said he was aware of two attempts, one not involving Branson, to impersonate the minister for illicit gain, and Fallon’s office were assisting the police in their efforts to try to catch those responsible.",Billionaire Branson targeted in $5 million scam 'straight out of le Carre',http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-fraud-branson/billionaire-branson-targeted-in-5-million-scam-straight-out-of-le-carre-idUSKBN1CN1AC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s economics ministry said it is “deeply concerned” about the antitrust agency imposing a $775 million fine on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), in a rare public display of disagreement between authorities.

Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) fined Qualcomm last week, saying the U.S. chipmaker had abused its monopolistic position by opting against licensing some modem-related technologies to other industry players.

Qualcomm said it disagreed and would take the matter to court once the agency releases a final report in coming weeks.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees industrial policy, said it respected the agency’s position but was concerned about any impact on foreign investment.

“With regards to the investigation and judgment process... our ministry is deeply concerned,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday.

“Considering economic stability and prosperity, as well as that the economics ministry is the government authority overseeing industry, the ministry would like to see better coordination between industrial development and fair trading.”

The ministry said the agency did not appear to take into account Qualcomm’s contribution to the overall local technology industry or impact on future business opportunities, describing the U.S. firm as an “indispensable partner”.

The FTC did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) supported the FTC’s action in a statement on Oct. 12, reiterating views of some industry players that it would lead to a fairer business environment for technological innovation.

The action is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing patents related to installation and use.

Wien (Reuters) - Die rechtspopulistische Freiheitliche Partei (FPÖ) stellt nach ihren hohen Zuwächsen bei der österreichischen Parlamentswahl Bedingungen für die bevorstehenden Koalitionsverhandlungen und fordert unter anderem den Posten des Innenministers.

“Wir drängen nicht um jeden Preis in eine Regierung, es müssen die freiheitlichen Inhalte umgesetzt werden”, sagte FPÖ-Chef Heinz-Christian Strache am Mittwoch. Sollte das nicht gelingen, gehe seine Partei in die Opposition.

Als eine Bedingung nannte der FPÖ-Chef die Grenzsicherung. “Solange die EU-Außengrenzen nicht geschützt sind, ist es die Verantwortung der österreichischen Regierung die eigenen Grenzen zu kontrollieren und zu sichern”, sagte Strache. Eine weitere Bedingung sei die Kürzung der Grundversorgung für Flüchtlinge. Die FPÖ fordere hier “mehr Sachleistungen statt Geldleistungen”, damit die “Sog- und Magnetwirkung von Wirtschaftszuwanderung” abgestellt werde. “Bitte jetzt aber nicht berichten, es gibt eine böse Partei, die will den Flüchtlingen alles wegnehmen”, sagte der ehemalige FPÖ-Präsidentschaftskandidat Norbert Hofer. Man müsse auch dazu sagen, dass es in Österreich mehr Asylwerber pro Kopf gebe als in anderen Ländern und diese auch mehr bekämen. Um all das umzusetzen, sei der Innenministerposten ebenfalls eine Koalitionsbedingung, sagte Strache.

Klarer Sieger der Wahl am Sonntag war die konservative Volkspartei (ÖVP) mit ihrem 31-jährigen Parteichef Sebastian Kurz.

Commercial egg production per day has dropped to 17 million from 20.4 million after an outbreak of the H5N8 virus, the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) acting CEO Charlotte Nkuna said.

“We used to have about 24 million hens, and now we have just under 20 million or so,” Nkuna told Reuters.

The industry has also seen 1,000 to 1,500 lay-offs as a result of avian flu between June and September, Nkuna said.

Job losses are a thorny issue in Africa’s biggest economy were the unemployment rate is near 28 percent, a 14-year high.

The impact of the virus on the poultry industry also poses a risk for food price inflation.

“Given the weight of poultry in the overall food price inflation, the spreading avian influenza will remain a key upside risk to food inflation over the foreseeable future,” Wandile Sihlobo, an economist at the agricultural business chamber, said in a note.

Inflation stood at 5.1 percent in September, up from 4.8 percent in August.

Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana suspended poultry imports from South Africa when the virus was detected.

South Africa’s coastal Western Cape province and second largest producer of egg layers, which has been grappling with a severe drought, is the hardest hit by the virus, Nkuna said.

“The Western Cape lost about 70 percent of their laying hen flock, and the other 30 percent has a percentage of that that is infected,” said Absa senior agricultural economist, Wessel Lemmer.

South African supermarket operator Pick n Pay’s chief executive Richard Brasher said the firm would source eggs from around the country due to the shortage in the Western Cape.

The avian flu attack follows a drought last year that led to job cuts and high feed prices.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

The London club are currently nine points behind leaders Manchester City after eight matches, prompting fans to wonder if they have already fallen behind in the title race.

Former Norway striker Flo believes Chelsea could still mount a title charge and pointed to last season when they went on a 13-match winning streak after dropping seven points in the first six.

“It’s been a bit up and down. Much of it has been very, very good but surprisingly we have also dropped some points,” Flo, who scored 50 goals in 163 appearances for Chelsea, told Reuters.

”We knew it would be difficult to have the same season as last year. But last year at the beginning Chelsea dropped some points too but then went on to win a lot of consecutive matches.

“It’s still possible to end at the top of the table at the end of the season. But it’s difficult, the Manchester teams are doing very well.”

Manchester United are currently second, two points behind neighbours City, with Tottenham Hotspur making up the top three in the league.

Chelsea suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday, their third loss in the league and only two less than the whole of the last campaign when Italian manager Antonio Conte took them to the title in his first year in west London.

“Obviously we would like to lead the table at the moment but we saw it last year, we can still catch up and do well,” Flo said.

“Chelsea are in the Champions League this season and as a club we will really want to do well in that one. We weren’t in the Champions League last year.”

Flo, who was in Mumbai as part of Chelsea’s trophy tour and a club foundation programme, blamed injuries for the club’s poor start.

Morata, who left Real Madrid for Chelsea in the off-season, has already scored seven goals but missed the Palace defeat through a hamstring injury. N‘Golo Kante and Victor Moses are also out with similar problems.

The 24-year-old Morata is expected to return from injury and lead the attack against AS Roma in the Champions League later on Wednesday.

“Morata is a very good striker and the challenge for Chelsea is to keep him fit. Chelsea will definitely miss him when he’s not playing, when he’s injured,” Flo, who works as a coach for Chelsea’s youth teams, said.

Compared to City’s 29 goals, Chelsea have managed 13 and six of them from the 58-million pound ($76.45 million) striker.

“If we can keep him fit and he can play a lot of matches then he will score a lot of goals,” Flo said.

Belgian Michy Batshuayi has failed to impress as a back-up to Morata but Flo pleaded for more time for Chelsea’s new signings.

“Chelsea got quite a few players but if you look at some of the other clubs too that have bought a lot of players,” he said.

”If we give little bit of time, I think the players that Chelsea bought will start doing a good job for the team.

“I don’t think Chelsea have a problem in front of goal. Batshuayi has shown he can score goals and Chelsea can use him a back-up for Morata.”

TORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted prayers for Downie’s family, adding that “our hearts break on news of the passing of ... an ally and friend.”

Downie had become an outspoken supporter of Canada’s indigenous people, penning songs about the painful legacy of colonialism and urging Canadians toward reconciliation.

In their statement, Downie’s family said the singer had spent his last days making music and memories with family and friends.

“Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years - those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars,” the statement said.","Canada's Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie dies, PM weeps",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CN1XZ-OCAEN

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it would recall about 1.3 million 2015-17 Ford F-150 and 2017 Ford Super Duty trucks in North America to add water shields to side door latches at a cost of $267 million.

The No.2 U.S. automaker said the safety recall is due to a frozen door latch or a bent or kinked actuation cable in the affected vehicles, that may result in a door not opening or closing.

A Ford spokeswoman said customers would be notified next month but did not have a timetable for when parts will be available. Dealers will install water shields over the door latches and inspect and repair door latch cables if needed.

Ford has now recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2016, but the company said the issue in the new recall is different from prior ones.

Ford said the cost of the new recall would be reflected in its fourth-quarter results. Ford said it continues to expect full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $1.65 to $1.85‍​ per share.

The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries associated with the issue but said because of the fault, the door may appear closed, increasing the risk of the door opening while driving.

Ford has previously disclosed plans to spend $935 million on other recalls announced since August 2016.

In March, Ford said it would spend $295 million to recall 211,000 vehicles in North America to replace potentially faulty side door latches and 230,000 vehicles for under-hood fire risks.

Rajoy issued his appeal in the national parliament, where he sought to win more political support for taking direct control of Catalonia on Thursday if the rebel regional government sticks to a plan to break away.

The move would need only a vote in Spain’s upper house, where Rajoy’s People’s Party holds an absolute majority.

It would be the first time in Spain’s four decades of democracy that direct rule has been imposed.

A constitutional provision allows the central government to impose the law by giving orders to all branches of the regional authorities. Precisely how that would work in practical matters such as commanding the police force is untested.

Authoritative Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia reported that Madrid plans to appoint its own delegates to run regional government departments. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont would remain nominally in his role but stripped of all powers.

Many Spaniards fear the unprecedented step could lead to social unrest. The crisis has prompted hundreds of Catalan firms to move their headquarters, led Madrid to cut economic growth forecasts and weighed on the euro.

In the latest grim prediction, Spain’s independent budget watchdog warned on Wednesday that continued uncertainty could wipe as much as 12 billion euros off the economy next year, reducing expected growth by between 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points.

Puigdemont has already defied Madrid once this week, reiterating on Monday an ambiguous independence declaration he made last week and immediately suspended.

“I ask Puigdemont to act sensibly, in a balanced way, to put the interests of all citizens first,” Rajoy said on Wednesday, mentioning both residents of the autonomous region, which produces a fifth of Spain’s wealth and has its own language and culture, and the rest of the country.

Thursday’s deadline is Puigdemont’s last chance to abandon an independence declaration which Madrid has rejected as illegal, and defuse Spain’s biggest political crisis since a failed military coup in 1981.

“It’s not that difficult to reply to the question: has Catalonia declared independence? Because if it has, the government is obliged to act in one way, and if it has not we can talk here,” Rajoy said in parliament.

The row has rattled financial markets and sent companies scurrying to relocate on safer ground. Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC), Spain’s fifth-biggest bank, was considering moving its top management to Madrid.

Almost 700 companies pulled out of the northeastern region between Oct. 2 - the day after a referendum on independence which Madrid branded illegal - and Oct. 16, according to Spain’s companies registry.

Tourism, a vital part of the Catalan economy centered on its seaside capital Barcelona, has also taken a hit, with activity falling 15 percent so far this month, industry association Exceltur said on Tuesday.

The region’s tourism industry could make 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) less than usual in the fourth quarter “if the volatility and confrontation get worse in the coming months”, Exceltur said in a statement.

THREAT OF DIRECT RULE

Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said last week that exactly what direct rule would look like is not clear, adding the government would work on it.

La Vanguardia said Puigdemont, a 54-year-old former journalist, was mulling declaring independence and calling so-called constituent elections for the newly-declared republic.

But Catalan foreign affairs chief Raul Romeva told a news conference in Brussels: “Elections are not on the table now.”

As the threat of direct rule neared, the Catalan government took a combative tone.

“Giving in forms no part of this government’s scenarios,” spokesman Jordi Turull said on Tuesday. “On Thursday, we won’t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.”

Tempers have flared since the jailing on Monday of two separatist leaders pending an investigation for alleged sedition.

Tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona’s Diagonal Avenue on Tuesday to call for their release, whistling and shouting “freedom” and “out with the occupying forces”.

Puigdemont said: “Sadly, we have political prisoners again,” referring to the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who suppressed Catalan culture and language until his death in 1975.",Spain asks Catalan leader to 'act sensibly' as direct rule deadline nears,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia-rajoy/spain-asks-catalan-leader-to-act-sensibly-as-direct-rule-deadline-nears-idUSKBN1CN0VF?il=0

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s economics ministry said it is “deeply concerned” about the antitrust agency imposing a $775 million fine on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), in a rare public display of disagreement between authorities.

Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) fined Qualcomm last week, saying the U.S. chipmaker had abused its monopolistic position by opting against licensing some modem-related technologies to other industry players.

Qualcomm said it disagreed and would take the matter to court once the agency releases a final report in coming weeks.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees industrial policy, said it respected the agency’s position but was concerned about any impact on foreign investment.

“With regards to the investigation and judgment process... our ministry is deeply concerned,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday.

“Considering economic stability and prosperity, as well as that the economics ministry is the government authority overseeing industry, the ministry would like to see better coordination between industrial development and fair trading.”

The ministry said the agency did not appear to take into account Qualcomm’s contribution to the overall local technology industry or impact on future business opportunities, describing the U.S. firm as an “indispensable partner”.

The FTC did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) supported the FTC’s action in a statement on Oct. 12, reiterating views of some industry players that it would lead to a fairer business environment for technological innovation.

The action is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing patents related to installation and use.

However, President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman struck a more positive tone, saying he expected the crisis to be resolved soon following the arrival in Turkey of a U.S. delegation for talks on repairing bilateral ties.

Earlier this month Washington suspended visa services after Turkey detained two Turkish nationals employed as U.S. consular staff. They are being held on suspicion of links to last year’s failed coup in Turkey, allegations rejected by Washington.

Ankara swiftly retaliated by suspending its own visa services in the United States. The dispute hit the Turkish lira and stocks and unnerved investors.

The United States has said it wants details of the charges against its staff, and Turkish broadcaster Haberturk said the U.S. delegation had set four conditions to solve the crisis, including Ankara providing evidence related to the detentions.

“We will cooperate if their demands meet the rules of our constitution but we will not succumb to impositions and we will reject any conditions that we cannot meet,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference on Wednesday.

The two people arrested by Turkey are a translator at the consulate in the southern province of Adana and a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) worker in Istanbul.

MOVING IN “GOOD DIRECTION”

Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the talks with the United States were now moving in a “good direction”.

“I believe this crisis will be resolved soon,” he told state-owned TRT Haber.

“The U.S. delegation does not have the authority to lift the visa suspension but they will communicate our views to Washington and, hopefully, the White House will take positive steps soon”.

Foreign Ministry sources described Wednesday’s talks as positive and said the two sides agreed to continue the discussions to resolve the dispute as soon as possible.

Relations between Turkey and its Western allies have soured significantly since the July 2016 coup and the large-scale purges of the Turkish armed forces, state institutions, media and academia that followed.

Ankara blames the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the coup and has repeatedly asked Washington to extradite him. Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup.

Turkey has sacked or suspended more than 150,000 people from their jobs on suspicion of links to the Gulen network, prompting criticism from rights groups, the United States and the European Union that Ankara is undermining free speech and democracy.",Turkey says will not submit to 'impositions' from United States in visa crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-turkey-security/turkey-says-will-not-submit-to-impositions-from-united-states-in-visa-crisis-idUKKBN1CN0WY?il=0

On Oct. 15, he will have to certify whether Tehran is observing the 2015 multinational agreement to forego nuclear weapons. Trump has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance, which is due quarterly, twice since taking office. This time, his belligerent address to the United Nations suggests he may not.If the United States follows through on threats to stop fulfilling its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the Iran deal is formally known, its allies in Europe will be forced to choose between committing a crime and making a mistake. Whichever they decide, the strength of the transatlantic coalition – America’s most important and most reliable partnership – will be cast into doubt.

Iran is complying with the JCPOA. The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly confirmed it, as have partner intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). European leaders oppose refusing to certify Iranian compliance because it would make it likely that Congress will re-impose U.S. sanctions.

That would be only the first of two body blows to the agreement and to the alliance. The second would be an abuse of U.S. authority to re-impose United Nations sanctions.

The president has the power to force the United Nations to “snap back” the multilateral sanctions lifted under the deal – biting restrictions on Iranian banks and other businesses. If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Turkey’s swift response to Somalia’s deadliest truck bombing drew praise from survivors and officials who called Ankara their “only genuine” international partner, an implicit challenge to that Western backers that spend billions on security.

Within 48 hours of the huge twin explosions that hit Mogadishu on Saturday, a Turkish air ambulance had landed in the battle-scarred capital and picked up dozens of wounded Somalis to transport them to Turkey for free medical treatment.

Its health minister also pitched up with surgeons who set to work at once in hospitals alongside Somali doctors and nurses.

Ankara has invested heavily in Somalia over the past five years, with one eye on rich economic pickings should stability ever return and the other on burnishing President Tayyip Erdogan’s image of Turkey as a global promoter of compassionate Islam.

“Turkey is the best friend to Somalia and they were the first supporter to us after the blast,” said Abdiasis Ahmed, a jobless university graduate who said four friends had been airlifted out, one with a broken back.

At least 300 people were killed in the blasts and more than 400 injured. Although Islamist al Shabaab militants were pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011, Saturday’s attack - which al Shabaab has not claimed - shows the dangers still facing the capital.

Many Somalis contrasted Ankara’s response with that of the European Union, which has a naval force including combat ships equipped with emergency medical systems off Mogadishu’s shore to deter piracy, but which did not take in casualties.

“I’ve heard a lot of complaints from Somalis saying ‘There’s a huge Western navy on our shores - why can’t those people come to help us?',” said Rashid Abdi, a Nairobi-based Somalia analyst at International Crisis Group, a think-tank.

A spokesman for the EU mission in Nairobi had no immediate comment, although a Tweet from the naval force on Wednesday said it was providing “vital medical aid” for the victims.

Senior officials also compared the speed and scale of Turkey’s assistance with that of Somalia’s foreign partners, including neighbors Kenya and Djibouti and the United States and the United Nations.

Mogadishu mayor Thabit Mohamed tweeted on Monday that he was grateful for Turkey’s “immediate response” and “relief for victims”, compared with a “Thanks for standing with #Mogadishu” tweet 24 hours later aimed at the U.S. Embassy.

“Turkey is always first to help us. They are our only genuine brother,” Information minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told Reuters, recalling a personal visit by Erdogan in 2011, when Somalia was in the grip of famine.

“Their support is visible to everyone. They build hospitals, they build schools, and that’s why they are different than others,” he said. “Others might give more money but Turkey is perceived by the people to be the ones really helping Somalia.”

His thoughts were echoed in a cartoon by popular cartoonist Amin Amir circulating on Somali social media depicting a Turkish Airlines plane surrounded by boxes labeled “equipment and supplies”.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc and the pro-business Free Democrats described their first talks on building a coalition government as constructive on Wednesday, but a meeting later with the Greens could prove more difficult.

Merkel, weakened by election losses last month, wants to forge an alliance between the bloc - her Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), but they differ on many policies.

Setting the stage for tough talks that could take several months, politicians from all parties have set out their stall, narrowing room for compromise in areas from immigration to the European Union and environmental policy.

After the first two-hour meeting, general secretaries from the two conservative parties and the FDP emerged, smiling, to tell reporters the talks had been positive.

“It was a good exchange, at times nice and above all mutually respectful and joyful,” said CSU General-Secretary Andreas Scheuer.

Merkel, whose conservatives bled support to the far right in the Sept. 24 election, warned her parliamentary party on Tuesday they would have to compromise.

Chancellor for 12 years and known as a skilled negotiator, she angered many voters over her open-door migrant policy and her conservatives saw their worst election result since 1949.

She has said she expects a government to be in place by Christmas, but others say January is more likely, pointing to a months-long policy standstill in Europe’s biggest economy.

The prospect of a minority government or new election hangs over the talks, a scenario Merkel wants to avoid due to fears the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could make bigger gains.

“It is totally conceivable that before Christmas or in January we say that the whole thing is pointless and we’ll talk to the Social Democrats (SPD),” Peter Ramsauer, a senior CSU member not on the negotiating team, told Deutschlandfunk.

The SPD, which suffered its worst result since 1933, has said it will go into opposition.

“That’ll probably be a bigger, tougher task,” said Scheuer.

“The first steps on this path went well, in an objective, solution-oriented atmosphere,” said FDP General-Secretary Nicola Beer. “We agreed that some of us might need to be creative to continue on this path in this way.”

The talks are focussed on building trust and agreeing a format for future talks rather than tackling hard policies.

CDU General-Secretary Peter Tauber, who described a “good feeling” at the talks, said: “Our clear goal is to have a good government for our country in the end.”

One of the toughest policy areas will be immigration.

Merkel, further weakened on Sunday by losses in a state election, has had to give way to the CSU on immigration, effectively bowing to a demand to limit the number of people allowed into Germany. That may be unacceptable to the Greens.

Merkel has spoken of a coalition that focuses on providing a sustainable social security system and has stressed the importance of investing in digital technology.

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Thousands of Somalis demonstrated on Wednesday against those behind bombings that killed more than 300 people, defying police who opened fire to keep them away from the site where their loved-ones were killed.

The twin blasts in the heart of Mogadishu on Saturday also injured more than 400 in what were the country’s deadliest truck bombings.

Police initially opened fire to prevent people from accessing the rubble-strewn scene of the attack, injuring at least two people, the emergency response service said. But, overwhelmed by the number of people, they eventually let thousands of protesters gather at the site.

Residents said they had never seen such a big protest in the city.

“We are demonstrating against the terrorists that massacred our people. We entered the road by force,” said Halima Abdullahi, a mother who lost six of her relatives in the attacks.

The Islamist militant group al Shabaab, which began an insurgency in 2007, has not claimed responsibility, but the method and type of attack - a large truck bomb - is increasingly used by the al Qaeda-linked organization.

Mohamed Ali, a police captain at the scene, said it was fine for protesters to access the site to express their grief.

“For some who could not see their relatives alive or dead, the only chance they have is to at least see the spot where their beloved were killed,” he told Reuters.

Later President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed addressed demonstrators at a football field in the city and called on Somalis to join the national army.

“Take your guns and let’s liberate our country. Come forward for recruitment (into) government forces in order to fight and eliminate al Shabaab,” he said.

The government buried at least 160 of those killed because they could not be identified after the blast.

Masked security officers kept an eye on the protest on foot and on motorbikes. Some protesters sat on police trucks waving sticks and chanting: “We do not want al Shabaab”.

The militants were driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 and have been steadily losing territory. But they retain the capacity to mount large bomb attacks.

Over the past three years, the number of civilians killed by insurgent bombings has steadily climbed as al Shabaab increases the size of its bombs.

In the central town of Dusamareb, residents also marched for several hours to protest against the bombings in Mogadishu and clerics called for the war on the militants to be stepped up.

Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Aamin Ambulances, said one pregnant demonstrator was evacuated from the Mogadishu protest after she developed complications.

LONDON (Reuters) - The bill for compensating families of those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London may be as low as 4 million pounds ($5 million), according to several lawyers and a Reuters analysis of how damages laws apply in England.

The blaze engulfed a 24-storey social housing block in west London on June 14, killing an estimated 80 people in the country’s deadliest fire since World War Two.

While similar disasters in the United States have led to massive payouts, any compensation for Grenfell would be far lower because English laws offer less generous damages and don’t allow punitive claims, even if companies are found criminally responsible, said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL).

The four main firms that have been linked to the Grenfell fire - U.S. companies Arconic Inc. and Whirlpool Corp. and Britain’s Harley Facades and Rydon Group - declined to comment on the size or calculation of potential payouts.

The Reuters calculation of a bill of 4 million pounds is based on the compensation amounts stipulated in the Fatal Accidents Act of 1976, precedents set in previous cases and the individual circumstances of the 70 victims identified so far.

Three personal injury lawyers have verified the methodology used by Reuters and said the estimate for the total payout is reasonable.

If the courts find there was no unlawful behavior by any of the companies or public bodies involved, victims will not be entitled to sue for compensation and would only get the financial support and temporary housing already provided by the government and public donations, personal injury lawyers said.

“The British judicial system is not renowned for being generous,” said Rebecca Thomas of law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing some victims’ families.

“It’s not about money for the families,” said Tim Murphy, whose brother Denis, a disabled former painter who lived on the 14th floor, died in the fire. “Nothing can ease our pain, (but) I think it’s quite insulting.”

The U.S. legal system sees punitive damages as a way of encouraging companies to behave lawfully, but British and European governments have taken the view this approach would put excessive burdens on the judicial system, businesses, insurers and state bodies that might be liable, some legal experts say.

While APIL said the Grenfell Tower disaster demonstrated the inadequacy of payouts to victims, Duncan Fairgrieve, who has advised the UK government on compensation rules, said more generous payouts could also harm society.

They could drive up insurance costs for all and lead to big claims against government bodies such as the National Health Service and the police, he said.

“There is an affordability issue,” said Fairgrieve, a Senior Research Fellow at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law.

FEW DEPENDENTS

If the courts find someone was wrongfully killed, the claim categories are a flat 12,980 pounds per victim for bereavement, costs such as funeral bills, dependency damages where minors or dependent spouses are left behind, and property damage - all to be paid by the party found responsible.

Under the 1976 law, only family members who were supported by those who died can claim dependency damages. Reuters has identified only five people who died leaving dependents who could definitely claim damages - on the basis they were financially dependent on the deceased.

Daniel Machover, a lawyer at Hickman and Rose, which is representing some victims’ families, also said he didn’t expect there to be many claims.

Most of the others who died in the fire were minors, single or elderly and did not leave family members who were financially dependent upon them.

The biggest dependency payout will be for children who lost both parents, said lawyers representing some of the victims.

One six-year-old girl, Tasnim Belkadi, lost her mother, father and all her siblings in the fire.

Lawyers said she could get 300,000 pounds, based on a share of her parents’ income and some childcare costs up to her 18th birthday. Her aunt, with whom she now lives, declined to comment on the Reuters calculation.

Grenfell plaintiffs can also claim expenses they incurred as the result of a death, such as the cost of a modest funeral.

Heirs to the deceased could also claim the value of goods lost in the fire. The Association of British Insurers puts the cost of replacing the contents of an average three-bedroom home at 55,000 pounds.

However, Thomas said Grenfell claims would probably be less than 30,000 pounds per property because compensation is based on the market value of personal belongings rather than replacement value, and the flats destroyed had only one or two bedrooms.

Based on the victims’ circumstances, Reuters has calculated the payout for dependency damages could be 1.2 million pounds, for property it could be 1.4 million and for bereavement it could come to 1.0 million. Other smaller claims for costs and loss of parental guidance take the total to 4 million pounds.

Police said the fire started in a fridge freezer made by a subsidiary of U.S. company Whirlpool and have been investigating whether the tower’s cladding, made by U.S. firm Arconic Inc., played a role in the spread of the blaze.

Arconic said it was up to contractors to ensure its products were used correctly. Whirlpool said it was investigating the fire.

Rydon Group, the contractor that oversaw the refurbishment when the new cladding was added, said it had complied with all regulations. Sub-contractor Harley Facades Ltd said it was not aware of any link between the fire and the cladding.

Fears among investors that companies linked to Grenfell could be sued for large sums in the United States hit their shares. Whirlpool’s market value fell about $250 million on June 23 when police identified the maker of the appliance as Hotpoint, a brand owned by Indesit, which is a subsidiary of Whirlpool based in Italy.

More than $1 billion was wiped off Arconic Inc.’s value after Reuters reported in June that internal emails showed it had supplied flammable cladding panels, knowing they would be used on the tower and despite warning in its brochures that only non-combustible panels should be used on tall buildings.

Arconic’s share price has recovered since its late June lows but it and Whirlpool’s stock are below the levels they were at just before the fire, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 7 percent over the same period.

Awards against companies in U.S. courts have run into the tens of millions of dollars per family in some cases.

In 1980, a fire blamed in part on inadequate fire safety measures killed 85 people at the MGM Grand Hotel in Nevada and injured hundreds. The hotel operator and contractors agreed to pay victims’ families and survivors more than $200 million.

Foreigners have often tried to sue U.S. corporations in U.S. courts over alleged wrongdoing abroad.

However, judges have consistently ruled they lacked jurisdiction in such cases, saying adequate tribunals existed in the plaintiff’s own country and that it would be hard for defendants to make their case in the United States.

Machover at Hickman and Rose said he was considering whether Grenfell victims could bring a U.S. case on the basis that two of the companies involved were based there.

But Thomas at Duncan Lewis and Leigh Day partner Jill Paterson were skeptical that U.S. courts would agree to hear Grenfell claims given the United Kingdom offers a reasonable forum for redress and because the U.S. companies were involved through European-registered subsidiaries.

“I can’t see any circumstances under which they could bring this in the United States,” said Thomas.

Arconic and Whirlpool declined to comment on the possibility of legal claims against them.",Damages for Grenfell fire victims may total just $5 million: Reuters analysis,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-fire-compensation-insight/damages-for-grenfell-fire-victims-may-total-just-4-million-reuters-analysis-idUKKBN1CN1PQ

Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of Nigeria. A number of foreigners have, in the last few years, been kidnapped in the Niger Delta region, which holds most of the country’s crude oil - the country’s economic mainstay.

“The abductors have not made any contact but we are doing our investigations to know the motive and have them rescued without jeopardising their lives,” said Aniamaka.

“Information available to us shows they are missionaries giving free medical services,” he said, adding that the British nationals had been working in a very rural area.

It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.","Russia’s latest “Zapad” military exercise is underway on NATO’S eastern border. Tens of thousands of soldiers are taking part in the massive four-yearly war games that are both a drill as well as a show of strength for the West. Next time around, in 2021, those troops might be sharing their battle space with a different type of force: self-driving drones, tanks, ships and submersibles.

Drone warfare is hardly new – the first lethal attack conducted by an American unmanned aerial vehicle took place in Afghanistan in October 2001. What is now changing fast, however, is the ability of such unmanned systems to operate without a guiding human hand.

That’s a truly revolutionary shift – and one every major nation wants to be lead. Critics have long feared countries might be more willing to go to war with unmanned systems. Now, some see a very real risk control might pass beyond human beings altogether.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has long warned that humanity might be on the verge of some cataclysmic errors when it comes to artificial intelligence. Last month, he ramped that up with a warning that the development of autonomous weapons platforms might provoke a potentially devastating arms race.

As if to reinforce Musk’s point, Russian President Vladimir Putin told students shortly thereafter that he believed the technology would be a game changer, making it clear Russia would plow resources into it. “The one who becomes leader in this will become ruler of the world,” Putin was quoted as saying.

China too is pushing ahead, believed by some experts to now be the global leader when it comes to developing autonomous swarms of drones.

Already, drones are able to fly themselves independently so they can stay airborne if they lose touch with human pilots. Soon they may be able to make their own tactical decisions. At Georgia Tech in the United States this summer, researchers programmed swarms of light drones to fight their own aerial dogfights. The U.S. military is trying out similar products.

That means one operator could command many, many more drones – or that they might not need direct supervision at all.

Even more important than what is happening in robotics may be the wider developments in artificial intelligence. That won’t make warfare necessarily more deadly – a bomb dropped from a drone is not in itself less lethal than one from a manned aircraft. While it’s possible that greater accuracy might reduce casualties, some analysts fear that the changes brought by new unmanned systems might themselves fuel new conflicts.

“Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas,” concluded a July report on the topic produced for the U.S. intelligence community by Harvard University’s Belfer Center. It warned an “inevitable” AI arms race could prove as revolutionary as the invention of nuclear weapons.

Artificial intelligence could dramatically increase the efficiency of surveillance technology, allowing a single system to monitor perhaps millions of digital conversations, hacked personal devices and other sources of information. The implications could be terrifying, particularly in the hands of a state with little or no democratic oversight.

At a recent UK panel discussion, Britain’s former Special Forces director Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb predicted that by 2030, technological breakthroughs – not just AI, but quantum computing and beyond – would produce entirely unpredictable changes. Special force teams, he suggested, might well have a robotic and artificial intelligence component deployed alongside them – the U.S. Army calls this “manned-unmanned teaming.”

That sounds like something out of science fiction – and it might well look like it. Last year, Russia unveiled its FEDOR humanoid military robot, which it demonstrated firing a gun.

Most countries deliberately keep their defense AI secret, ultimately fueling the arms race Musk was warning about. Some scientists already worry about a real-world version of the premise for the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring “Terminator” film franchise in which the United States, fearing cyber attack, hands control of key military systems to the artificial intelligence Skynet. (Skynet, fearing its human creators might choose to turn it off, immediately launches a full-scale nuclear attack on humanity.)

For now, Western nations at least look keen to keep a human in the “kill chain.” Not all countries may make that choice, however. Russia has long had a reputation for trusting machines more than people, at one stage considering – and, some evidence suggests, building – an automated system to launch its nuclear arsenal should its command structure be destroyed by a first strike.

Outside of the military, there is evidence AI algorithms have already alarmed their creators. In August, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after programs involved began communicating with each other in a language the humans monitoring them could not understand.

Is this the end for ordinary human soldiering? Almost certainly not. It’s even been argued that a more complex, high-tech battlefield might require more soldiers, not fewer.

Robotic systems may be vulnerable to hacking, jamming and simply rendered inoperable through electronic warfare. Such techniques allow U.S.-led forces in Iraq to largely negate the off-the-shelf drones being used by Islamic State. Russia used similar techniques against Western-made drones in Ukraine.

That’s a worry for armed forces betting – like many industries – on automation. Britain’s new aircraft carrier has only a fraction of the sailors on its only slightly larger U.S. carrier counterparts, relying heavily on automatic systems to manage weaponry and damage control. The latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has an automated turret that will usually be out of reach to most of its crew. Such techniques have clear advantages – but also mean that interfering with electronics could leave them useless.

Such technology is coming whether it is a good idea or not. Indeed, even relatively old military equipment increasingly can be retrofitted. Russian engineers have already demonstrated that they can adapt the 20-year-old T-90 tank to be controlled remotely.

Ironically, the North Korean crisis reminds us that the most dangerous technologies may well remain those invented more than 70 years ago – atomic weapons and the missiles that carry them. Even if mankind can avoid a nuclear apocalypse, however, the coming AI and robotic revolution may prove an equal existential challenge.",Commentary: The coming robot arms race,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-robots-commentary/commentary-the-coming-robot-arms-race-idUSKCN1BT1XN

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc began offering electronics from third-party sellers to Brazilian shoppers on Wednesday, expanding beyond books in the fiercely competitive e-commerce market in Latin America’s largest economy.

The long-awaited move will offer televisions, cell phones and laptops from hundreds of independent sellers on Amazon’s website in Brazil without involving the company in the tricky logistics that have hurt many online retailers in the country.

Alex Szapiro, Amazon’s country manager in Brazil, declined to say if there were plans for the company to stock its own electronics inventory or open a fulfillment center to ship third-party goods more efficiently, as it did simultaneously with the launch of independent sellers in Mexico two years ago.

“Each country has a different playbook,” said Szapiro in an interview with Reuters at Amazon headquarters in Sao Paulo. He helped launch the company’s Brazil business with e-books in 2012 after running operations for Apple Inc in the country for five years.

Shares of local e-commerce rivals MercadoLibre Inc, Magazine Luiza SA and B2W Cia Digital have fallen 14 percent, 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the past week on concerns of heightened competition from Amazon.

Keeping pace with the local e-commerce market, Amazon will parcel purchases into as many as 10 monthly installments without interest, a practice the company started in Brazil for Kindle e-reader sales in 2014, then extended to Mexico and other markets.

Sellers will be paid up-front, minus a 10 percent commission to Amazon and fees of 19 reais ($6) per month or 2 reais per item. Szapiro called the 10 percent commission a “promotional” rate without saying when or how much it would eventually rise.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top U.S. bankers are still hoping that President Trump’s administration will make policy changes to boost profits, but made clear in public comments in recent days that they are not seeing any signs of progress so far.

Optimism about tax cuts, infrastructure investment and an unwind of costly financial regulations sent bank stocks soaring after the November 2016 presidential election that ushered Donald Trump into the White House.

THE KBW bank stock index .BKX rose 28 percent through the end of February. Since then, however, the index has risen only another 2.7 percent, less than the rise in the broader stock market.

In reporting third-quarter earnings, executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) said Trump’s actions so far have not driven business activity or expense reductions.

“These things are great – if and when they happen – but they’re not embedded in any of our plans,” Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez said about the idea of changing financial regulations on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.

His comments echoed those of his JPMorgan counterpart, Marianne Lake, who said last week that discussing tax reform with clients is like “talking about a hypothetical at this point.”

The White House unveiled a nine-page tax “framework” in late-September that called for cutting the corporate tax rate, among other things, but it is unclear if or how Congress will actually adapt it into law.

Nonetheless, bankers said the pro-business tone from Washington has been encouraging after a long period of anti-Wall Street sentiment and increasingly tough regulations.

Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said tax reform, higher interest rates, and regulatory changes could drive bank profits higher over the longer term, while Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said he likes the direction the Trump administration is taking, even if policy changes remain uncertain.

In presentations for investors, some analysts asked bank executives if slower commercial and industrial loan growth was a result of uncertainty in Washington, but executives said that was not the case.

PEQUIM (Reuters) - O presidente da China, Xi Jinping, abriu nesta quarta-feira uma edição crucial do Congresso do Partido Comunista com a promessa de construir um “país de sociedade moderna” para uma “nova era”, que será orgulhosamente chinesa e comandada com firmeza pelo partido, mas aberta para o mundo.

O discurso abrangente de Xi delineou uma visão confiante para uma China mais próspera e seu lugar na comunidade internacional, enfatizando a importância de se erradicar a corrupção e conter o excesso de produção industrial, a desigualdade de renda e a poluição.

Xi deixou claro que não existem planos de reforma política, mas disse que o desenvolvimento chinês entrou em uma “nova era”, frase que usou 36 vezes durante o discurso de quase três horas e meia.

“Com décadas de trabalho duro, o socialismo com características chinesas cruzou a fronteira para uma nova era”, disse.

O congresso, que ocorre duas vezes por década e dura uma semana, a maior parte do tempo a portas fechadas, culminará na seleção de um novo Comitê Permanente do Politburo, que governará os 1,4 bilhão de habitantes do país pelos próximos cinco anos. Xi deve consolidar seu controle e pode se manter no poder para além de 2022, quando o próximo congresso acontece.

Xi, de 64 anos, visto por muitos como o líder chinês mais poderoso desde Mao Tsé-Tung, discursou no Grande Salão do Povo de Pequim a mais de 2 mil delegados, entre eles o ex-presidente Jiang Zemin, hoje com 91 anos de idade. A segurança foi reforçada no dia chuvoso que envolveu a capital.

Como esperado, o discurso foi repleto de aspirações e escasso de planos específicos.

Na economia, Xi disse que a China relaxará o acesso de investimentos estrangeiros ao mercado, ampliará o acesso ao seu setor de serviços e aprofundará uma reforma de sua taxa de câmbio e seu sistema financeiro, um agrado ao mercado, ao mesmo tempo fortalecendo as estatais do país.

Clinton also called on China to take a “more outfront role” in enforcing sanctions against North Korea aimed at curbing its missile and nuclear development.

“There is no need for us to be bellicose and aggressive (over North Korea),” Clinton told the World Knowledge Forum in the South Korean capital of Seoul, stressing the need for more pressure on North Korea and diplomacy to bring Pyongyang to talks.

Tension between Pyongyang and Washington has soared following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“Picking fights with Kim Jong Un puts a smile on his face,” Clinton said, without mentioning Trump by name.

Clinton also indirectly referred to Trump’s social media comments on North Korea, saying, “The insults on Twitter have benefited North Korea, I don’t think they’ve benefited the United States”.

The war of words has seen Trump call the North Korean leader “little rocket man” on a suicide mission, and vow to destroy the country if it threatens the United States or its allies. In turn, the North called Trump “mentally deranged” and a “mad dog”.

Talks between the adversaries have long been urged by China in particular, but Washington and its ally Japan have been reluctant while Pyongyang continues to pursue a goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile to hit the United States.

On Tuesday, Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan said the United States did not rule out the eventual possibility of direct talks with North Korea.

The situation on the Korean peninsula was now touch-and-go point “and a nuclear war may break out any moment”, North Korea’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Kim In Ryong had told a U.N. General Assembly committee on Monday.

In Seoul, the vice foreign minister said on Wednesday South Korea was considering levying its own sanctions on the North, although no decision has been made yet.

CHINA PRESSURE

Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said Washington’s allies have increasingly been expressing concern over the reliability of the United States, advising Washington to avoid becoming distracted with North Korean threats and be “as forcefully patient” as possible.

Regarding China’s role in reining in North Korea, Clinton said Beijing would be better off trying to “tighten and absolutely enforce sanctions” against North Korea.

North Korea’s relationship with its main ally and trading partner China have been strained by its rapid pursuit of weapons programs, with many of Pyongyang’s recent tests coinciding with major Chinese events.

There had been fears that North Korea would conduct another test to coincide with the start of China’s five-yearly party congress on Wednesday. Instead, Pyongyang sent Beijing a congratulatory message.

The central committee of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party of Korea said China had made “great progress in accomplishing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics” under the guidance of the Communist Party of China.

“We are greatly pleased over this,” the party central committee said in the message carried by the official KCNA news agency, adding that it “sincerely wished” the China congress “satisfactory success”.

Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention North Korea in his more than three-hour-long address at the opening of a key Communist Party Congress.

CAN‘T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS

Clinton said retaliatory actions by China over the deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea, which targeting the latter’s firms doing business in China, would be unnecessary had Beijing done a better job reining in the North.

China says the powerful radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system could be used to pierce its territory, and has taken aim at South Korea’s businesses. South Korea and the United States have repeatedly told China that THAAD aims only to defend against North Korea’s missile threats.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street hit new records on strong earnings and the dollar extended a winning streak on Wednesday, boosted by rising Treasury yields as investors focused on monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury yields hit years-long highs and the difference in yield between U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasuries fell to the lowest since November 2007 as expectations for tighter global monetary policy pushed investors to sell shorter-dated Treasuries.

“The general tone from Fed speakers this week has been more on the hawkish side,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. “That and the global removal of accommodation is something markets have noticed.”

Rajappa said U.S. yields were rising in concert with European government bonds on expectations the European Central Bank, could signal a rollback of monetary stimulus on Thursday.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was boosted by strong earnings from heavyweight International Business Machines (IBM.N), which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average open above 23,000 for the first time.

“We’re in a sweet spot where the economy is growing not too strong and not too weak, the Fed’s tightening but not too rapidly, and earnings continue to expand. All the news is positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 121.94 points, or 0.53 percent, to 23,119.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.2 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,560.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.06 points, or 0 percent, to 6,623.72.

Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.3447 percent, from 2.298 percent late on Tuesday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 32/32 in price to yield 2.8531 percent, from 2.803 percent late on Tuesday.

The dollar index .DXY rose 0.09 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.05 percent to $1.1772.

In commodity markets, Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday and U.S. crude declined, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs boosted inventories of gasoline and diesel.

U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.25 percent to $51.75 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.85, down 0.05 percent on the day.

Gold fell for a third straight session on pressure from a firmer dollar amid speculation that the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve could be a policy hawk. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.3 percent to $1,280.53 an ounce.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Toxic fumes from kitchen drains forced the European Union on Wednesday to switch the venue of its summit in Brussels less than 24 hours before leaders were due to begin the two-day meeting.

The Europa Building, also known as “The Egg” and opened only in January amid controversy over its cost, was evacuated for the second time in a week on Wednesday after catering staff were taken ill due to fumes suspected to be leaking from the drains.

As a “precautionary measure”, the summit will now take place next door in the Justus Lipsius Building, an anonymous 1990s glass and stone-clad structure, which housed Europe’s councils until the opening of the 321-million-euro ($378 million) Europa.

The new building incorporates an exterior of jumbled salvaged window frames, a summit chamber painted a psychedelic patchwork, and an illuminated “lantern” containing several stories of offices that is visible from the street and known to locals as “Van Rompuy’s Egg” after the Belgian former summit chair.

About 20 kitchen staff were treated in hospital on Friday and an EU official said the Council and Belgian safety bodies were working on the assumption that Wednesday’s incident was due to the same source.

It was unclear how many staff were made ill on Wednesday.

Highlights of the summit are likely include an address by British Prime Minister Theresa May to the other 27 on her Brexit plans over dinner on Thursday and a statement to be agreed by the 27 on Friday that will demand London offer tens of billions of euros more on its withdrawal in 2019 if it wants to start negotiating a future relationship based on a free trade pact.",Egged off: EU summit venue switched after noxious fumes,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-summit-fumes-switch/egged-off-eu-summit-venue-switched-after-noxious-fumes-idUKKBN1CN238?il=0

HOW IT UNFOLDEDFILE PHOTO: Chief Financial Officer of Rio Tinto, Guy Elliott, speaks during Russian Business Week 2011 at the London School of Economics in London February 18, 2011.","SYDNEY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday charged mining company Rio Tinto Plc (RIO.L) (RIO.AX) and two of its former top executives with fraud, saying they inflated the value of coal assets in Mozambique and concealed critical information while tapping the market for billions of dollars.

The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also said on Tuesday it had reached a settlement with Rio Tinto under which the company would pay a fine of £27 million ($35.6 million) to settle claims that it breached accounting rules in connection with the Mozambique assets.

The Mozambican coal business, which relied on barging the product down the Zambezi River to port, was acquired for $3.7 billion in 2011 from Riversdale Mining and sold a few years later for $50 million.

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. federal court in Manhattan, the SEC said Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Thomas Albanese, and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record the assets.

The SEC said that soon after the deal was completed, Rio Tinto learned that the acquisition would yield less coal, and of a lower quality, than expected. The global miner could only transport and sell a fraction of the coal it had originally assumed, the SEC said.

By making misleading public statements, Rio Tinto and the executives were able to raise $5.5 billion from U.S. investors, the SEC said. They continued to solicit the investments even after executives of the Mozambique subsidiary told Albanese and Elliott that the unit was likely worth negative $680 million, according to the SEC.

“There is no truth in any of these charges,” Albanese said in a statement.

Christina Mills, a spokeswoman for Elliott, said Elliott would vigorously contest the charges.

Rio Tinto said it would defend itself vigorously against the SEC’s allegations. The company said the U.K. FCA had “made no findings of fraud, or of any systemic or widespread failure by Rio Tinto”.

HOW IT UNFOLDED

The SEC allegations are contained in court documents that also request a jury trial. The SEC said the rapid and dramatic decline in value of the coal business was concealed, in part because Rio Tinto had already disclosed huge losses in connection with its 2007 acquisition of Alcan.

“The Mozambique acquisition was expected to restore the market’s confidence in Albanese’s deal-making acumen, but on-the-ground realities in Mozambique quickly undermined that narrative,” the SEC said.

The SEC said the company knew its barging assumptions were unrealistic and railway capacity severely limited by the end of 2011, just months after securing the Riversdale assets.

“Defendants concealed the nature and extent of these adverse developments from Rio Tinto’s Board of Directors, Audit Committee, independent auditors, and the market,” the SEC said.

The SEC said that if it had been disclosed, the developments would have triggered an impairment analysis. An impairment analysis would measure the difference in the expected cash flow from an asset and the value the company has booked the asset at.

By May 2012, Albanese and Elliott were informed of the negative $680 million valuation, although the company carried the assets on its books at more than $3 billion while also promoting its prospects to the market.

The SEC said the fraud continued until January 2013, when another executive discovered accounting irregularities. Albanese subsequently resigned and the value of the Mozambique assets were lowered by more than $3 billion.

The SEC is seeking to have Albanese and Elliott barred from acting as officers or directors of any public company.

The SEC also disclosed that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission was looking into Rio’s accounting of the Mozambique assets.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.

“I don’t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.”

Trump’s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.

Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran’s state matters, welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.

“European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.”

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran’s compliance with the terms.

Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.

In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

“DO NOT INTERFERE”

In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran’s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons.

Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.

EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran’s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.

“They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America’s bullying and its unreasonable demands,” Khamenei said.

“They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?”

The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran’s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans.

Iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.

“Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region,” Khamenei said.

Supporters of the deal fear Trump’s decision to decertify the deal could eventually unravel it, causing more tension in the crisis-hit Middle East, where Shi‘ite Iran is involved in a decades long proxy war with U.S. ally Sunni Saudi Arabia.

If the deal falls apart, Iran’s anti-Western hardliners will gain authority in a backlash against pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani, who engineered the accord to help end Iran’s political and economic isolation, analysts and insiders say.",Khamenei says Iran will 'shred' nuclear deal if U.S. quits it,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CN167-OCATP

LONDON (Reuters) - The Football Association made a public apology to England women’s football internationals Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence on Wednesday for discriminatory comments made to them by former manager Mark Sampson.

The apology came in a statement just as a parliamentary inquiry was beginning in London with senior FA officials facing questions over the investigations into Sampson’s alleged racism and bullying of Aluko.

Yet the statement also said that an investigation had concluded that Sampson, who was sacked by the FA last month for “inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour” in a previous job, was not racist.

The 35-year-old Sampson denies the allegations and was cleared of discrimination by two inquiries.

“On behalf of The Football Association I would like to sincerely apologise to Eniola Aluko and Drew Spence,” the FA’s chief executive Martin Glenn said in the statement.

Revealing the findings of independent barrister Katharine Newton’s reopened investigation into the claims, Glenn said she had found, after hearing new evidence, that Aluko and Spence had both been subject to discriminatory remarks made by Sampson.

“This is not acceptable,” he added.

”In her final report Katharine Newton concluded that on two separate occasions Mark Sampson made ill-judged attempts at humour, which as a matter of law were discriminatory on grounds of race within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010.

“Katharine Newton did however conclude that Mark Sampson was not racist.”

The experienced international Aluko had claimed that Sampson had told her to be careful that her Nigerian relatives did not bring the Ebola virus with them when they came to watch a game at Wembley.

Spence, a mixed-race player, alleged that after being called up to the England team in 2015 she was asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION

The statement also said that Newton had also concluded “there was no evidence to support the allegations that Eniola Aluko was subjected to ‘a course of bullying and discriminatory conduct’ by Mark Sampson.”

Aluko, who has been capped 102 times for England, has not played since making her claims last year.

The 30-year-old said she had suffered “victimisation” for speaking out about discrimination in the England team set-up.

She received around £80,000 from the FA, which said the settlement was to avoid the threat of an employment tribunal disrupting the England women’s team’s preparations for this year’s European Championships.

The FA had asked Newton to look at the issues again after complaints that key witnesses had not been interviewed.

“Our ambition has always been to find the truth and take swift and appropriate action if needed,” said the FA statement.

”It was our decision to have the original, second and final investigation to ensure that due diligence was taken.

GENNEVILLIERS, France (Reuters) - In Gennevilliers, a communist-held suburb on the Paris outskirts, President Emmanuel Macron’s promises to help the poor are met with scorn.

It was in this drab working-class neighborhood that the former investment banker launched his anti-poverty plan this week as he struggles to shake off the tag of “president of the rich”.

Unemployment here is above the national average and one in four people live in poverty. Macron pledges to overhaul professional training to get the jobless back to work quicker. He has also announced increased disability allowances, a revamp of social housing, and the phasing-out of an unpopular housing tax.

Yet his plans to assist poorer households have been eclipsed by reforms widely perceived as favoring the rich and investors, including the scrapping of a wealth tax and a cut in corporate tax.

Nathalie and Pascal Dilard were forced to give up their flat after they lost their jobs. With their teenage son, they now reside with Pascal’s elderly parents, living off 400 euros a month.

“Anti-poverty? I‘m sorry, but when I see our situation, that makes me laugh,” Nathalie, 50, said as anti-riot police pushed back protesting unionists during Macron’s visit.

“My problem with him is that he helps the rich, not the little people like us. We can just die,” she said.

Six months into his presidency, Macron, 39, is moving fast with his drive to re-shape France’s social and economic model.

That has won him praise from international investors, euro zone allies and billionaires such as Bernard Arnault, the head of luxury giant LVMH, who say his pro-business policies will win new investments and create jobs.

But in a country whose “soul is equality”, as former president Francois Hollande once said, and whose tax and welfare systems have produced lower levels of inequality than in Britain or the united States, Macron’s reforms have angered left-wing opponents, unions and workers.

TRICKLE-DOWN

Commentators have likened Macron’s policies to the “trickle-down” economics espoused by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and Britain’s Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher. They believed tax cuts for the rich would benefit the poor through increased consumption and investment.

Macron on Sunday rejected trickle-down economics, opting instead for a rock-climbing analogy whereby he wanted “lead climbers” to be strong enough to haul up those behind.

The measures planned for the next five years will increase the living standards of the poorest 10 percent by 2.1 percent, while the richest 10 percent will be 1.2 percent better off by 2022, according to a French Treasury study.

The only segment of the population that will be marginally worse off is the upper middle class, it said.

But according to the OFCE economic think-tank, that will translate into a 700 euros per year income increase for the richest 10 percent, while the poorest 10 percent will be less than 200 euros better off.

Former Harvard university economist Philippe Aghion, who helped shape Macron’s economic program, said “Macronomics” was more akin to the Scandinavian model because of the place given to state investment in training and education.

Nonetheless Macron’s reforms have re-ignited the debate about redistribution between rich and poor and reveal a weak public confidence that the measures will bring investments beneficial for the whole economy, said the Eurointelligence think-tank.

”You will never motivate the French people with ‘competitiveness’. “You will always motivate them with ‘grands projets’,” said economist Christian Saint-Etienne, referring to large-scale undertakings such as France’s post-war state investment in high-speed trains, planes and nuclear plants.

In Gennevilliers, two retirees bemoaned Macron’s intention of increasing a social welfare tax on pensions.

“My husband worked 50 hours a week from the age of 15. And now they tell us you pensioners are getting too much in retirement!” said one of them, 63-year-old Lisianne Jouvenaux.","In working class Paris suburb, 'Macronomics' falls flat",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-macron/in-working-class-paris-suburb-macronomics-falls-flat-idUSKBN1CN2AS?il=0

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A second U.S. federal judge has blocked parts of President Donald Trump’s latest travel ban on people entering the United States from eight countries, dealing another legal blow to the administration’s third bid to impose travel restrictions.

U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, in a ruling issued overnight, said the policy as applied to six majority-Muslim countries likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on religious discrimination. He also ruled the ban ran afoul of immigration law.

Together, the pair of rulings set up a high-stakes battle over the president’s executive authority that is expected to ultimately wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump’s latest order targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. Neither of the court rulings lifts the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela.

In the Maryland ruling, Chuang questioned the government’s argument that the restrictions are needed until the affected countries provide more information on travelers to the United States.

He cited various statements made by Trump, including his 2015 call for a “total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States.”

Chuang wrote that the president’s public statements “not only fail to advance, but instead undermine, the position that the primary purpose of the travel ban now derives from the need to address information sharing deficiencies.”

The latest ban, announced last month, was the third version of a policy that targeted Muslim-majority countries but had been restricted by the courts. The Maryland case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project.

“Like the two versions before it, President Trump’s latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core. And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts,” said ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu said Hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that the policy violated federal immigration law. The White House called the ruling flawed and said it would appeal.

Unlike the Hawaii ruling, the Maryland decision would lift the restrictions only for people with family connections to the United States.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street hit new records on strong earnings and the dollar extended a winning streak on Wednesday, boosted by rising Treasury yields as investors focused on monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury yields hit years-long highs and the difference in yield between U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasuries fell to the lowest since November 2007 as expectations for tighter global monetary policy pushed investors to sell shorter-dated Treasuries.

“The general tone from Fed speakers this week has been more on the hawkish side,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. “That and the global removal of accommodation is something markets have noticed.”

Rajappa said U.S. yields were rising in concert with European government bonds on expectations the European Central Bank, could signal a rollback of monetary stimulus on Thursday.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was boosted by strong earnings from heavyweight International Business Machines (IBM.N), which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average open above 23,000 for the first time.

“We’re in a sweet spot where the economy is growing not too strong and not too weak, the Fed’s tightening but not too rapidly, and earnings continue to expand. All the news is positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 121.94 points, or 0.53 percent, to 23,119.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.2 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,560.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.06 points, or 0 percent, to 6,623.72.

Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.3447 percent, from 2.298 percent late on Tuesday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 32/32 in price to yield 2.8531 percent, from 2.803 percent late on Tuesday.

The dollar rose for a fifth straight day, boosted by soaring Treasury yields.

The dollar index .DXY rose 0.09 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.05 percent to $1.1772.

“It’s all about the yields this week, so far,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. [L8N1MT3Q4]

In Europe, stocks edged up with a raft of company results in focus. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.22 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.11 percent.[.EU]

In commodity markets, Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday and U.S. crude declined, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs boosted inventories of gasoline and diesel.

U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.25 percent to $51.75 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.85, down 0.05 percent on the day.

Gold fell for a third straight session on pressure from a firmer dollar amid speculation that the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve could be a policy hawk. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.3 percent to $1,280.53 an ounce.

But while money will unite leaders at this week’s European summit, it will divide them after Brexit.

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

John Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Doing the right thing is its own – and sometimes only – reward. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s hints that policy interest rates may soon rise can be justified by higher inflation. But he is in a no-win situation. The central banker will be criticised for hurting a slow-growing economy if he hikes and accused of playing fast and loose if he delays.

UK inflation is running a full percentage point above the central bank’s 2 percent target and has reached levels not seen since 2012, national statistics office data showed on Tuesday. True, the impact of past declines in sterling, triggered by last year’s vote to leave the European Union, should fade. But there are other good reasons why a majority of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee judged in September that policy rates might have to rise. Unemployment is at 4.3 percent, its lowest in more than four decades, suggesting there is little slack in the economy. Consumer debt is growing at nearly a double-digit clip.

Critics – including a majority of economists polled by Reuters – believe that raising rates from a record low of 0.25 percent would be an error on a par with that made by the European Central Bank when it raised rates during the financial crisis. They point out that the economy grew just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, the slowest rate of any Group of Seven industrial nation. Worse may be ahead if the UK struggles to agree a new trade deal with the European Union and falls out with its largest trading partner.

But political uncertainty will linger for a while. And the parallel with the ECB in 2008 is imperfect: the Bank kept policy very loose after the Brexit vote, and rates have been at record lows for many years. Carney’s least bad option may therefore be to tighten policy and rethink if the worst comes to pass. His life is unlikely to be much easier if he delays. UK lawmakers branded him an “unreliable boyfriend” in 2014 after he shied away from an expected rate rise.

(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights from National Basketball Association games on Tuesday:

Cavaliers 102, Celtics 99

LeBron James outdueled his former teammate and NBA Finals partner Kyrie Irving in the Cleveland Cavaliers’ 102-99 win over the Boston Celtics in their season opener on Tuesday.

However, the bigger loss for Boston was new forward Gordon Hayward, who fractured his left ankle in the first period. The injury occurred when Hayward was bumped in the air by LeBron James and fell with his leg pinned under him.

Hayward, 27, who signed a four-year, $128 million contract in the offseason with the Celtics, immediately called for help with his foot and ankle dangling in the wrong direction.

James finished with 29 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists after missing most of the preseason with a left ankle sprain.

Irving, who requested a trade away from James and the Cavs in the offseason and was dealt to the Celtics, finished with 22 points and 10 assists in his return to Cleveland.

Rockets 122, Warriors 121

Luc Mbah a Moute ignited a rally with 12 fourth-quarter points, and P.J. Tucker scored the game’s final two on a pair of free throws with 44.1 seconds left, helping the Houston Rockets stun the Golden State Warriors 122-121 in the defending champion’s ring-ceremony opener.

Houston trailed by 11 entering the final period and were 114-107 after a Stephen Curry 3-pointer with 5:12 left before rallying to hand Golden State its second consecutive opening night loss at home.

The Rockets also beat Golden State in the teams’ first meeting last season, a double-overtime thriller, before the Warriors captured the season series by taking the final three matchups.

Eric Gordon had a three-point play and Tucker a 3-point shot during the late flurry, which was capped when two offensive rebounds gave the Rockets a third possession in the final minute, down 121-120.

International benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell two cents to $57.86 a barrel as of 11:18 a.m. EDT (1518 GMT). They reached their highest in three weeks earlier in the session at $58.54 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 11 cents to $51.77 a barrel.

Weekly U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding expectations. [EIA/S]

Refiners throttled down activity as the fall maintenance season got underway, and overall refining runs fell off. In addition, inventories of gasoline and diesel rose, the latter unexpectedly, reviving some concerns about elevated inventories during a time when demand for petroleum products declines.

The dropoff of 4.7 percentage points took refining output to 84.5 percent of capacity, representing the seasonally slowest rate of output since 2011.

“A setback in refinery utilization rates occurred as refiners undergo seasonal maintenance,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “Builds in refined products and a setback in refined product demand provides weight to the energy complex.”

The market has been buoyant of late due to developments in the Middle East, where tensions in northern Iraq threatened to disrupt oil flows through a key pipeline from Iraq to Turkey.

Crude flows through the 600,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Kurdish pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have dropped off sharply to around 225,000 bpd, a shipping source told Reuters.

“It remains to be seen whether the Kurds, after withdrawing from the region they claim to be entitled to, will allow crude oil to be transported by pipeline across their territory to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan,” said analysts at Commerzbank.

The Iraq crisis represents one of two notable Middle Eastern threats to oil supply, along with the ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran’s compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide on further action against Tehran.

During the previous round of sanctions against Iran, some 1 million barrels per day of oil was cut from global markets.

More than one month ahead of OPEC’s next official meeting, sources told Reuters its members were leaning toward extending an oil supply cut deal struck with Russia and other producers for a further nine months.

Three OPEC sources said keeping the curbs in place until the end of 2018 was a likely outcome, while a fourth said an extension of six to nine months would be needed to remove all excess oil in storage.

A technical pattern known as a “Golden Cross” was approaching in WTI crude oil contracts on Wednesday, in which the 50-day moving average climbs higher than the 200-day. This is widely seen as a bullish price indicator, and already occurred with Brent futures on Sept. 25.","Oil slips from earlier gains as U.S. gasoline, diesel stocks rise",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-slips-from-earlier-gains-as-u-s-gasoline-diesel-stocks-rise-idUSKBN1CN05M?il=0

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government threw its weight behind a bid to host the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, promising on Wednesday to provide up to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.02 billion) to support the campaign.

It was a rare signal of support for hosting the Games after voters in the Austrian city of Innsbruck gave a thumbs down to the idea on Sunday, joining around a dozen cities that have pulled out of the running.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), based in the Swiss city of Lausanne, has been struggling in recent years to convince potential hosts of the benefits of hosting the Games.

The Swiss government embraced the idea enthusiastically.

“The government sees the Olympic Winter Games as a great opportunity for sport, the economy and society in Switzerland,” it said after a cabinet meeting approved public support for the Sion 2026 campaign.

It set conditions that the project primarily uses existing infrastructure and focuses on sustainability by spreading events over various cantons (states) and relying on public transport.

The plan still needs support from parliament and could face referendums in cantons hosting events. Sion is in the canton of Valais, in the southwest of the country.

Switzerland hosted the Winter Games in 1928 and 1948, both times in St Moritz in the eastern canton of the Grisons. Voters in that canton in February rejected raising money for pursuing a bid.

The IOC said on Tuesday said it would take a more “pro-active role” with potential 2026 host cities, introducing a non-committal “dialogue stage” running from October this year to October 2018.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Tehran would stick to its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Khamenei spoke five days after U.S. President Donald Trump adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the deal, reached under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, and saying he might ultimately terminate it.

“I don’t want to waste my time on answering the rants and whoppers of the brute (U.S.) president,” Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran quoted by state television.

“Trump’s stupidity should not distract us from America’s deceitfulness ... If the U.S. tears up the deal, we will shred it ... Everyone should know that once again America will receive a slap in its mouth and will be defeated by Iranians.”

Trump’s move put Washington at odds with other parties to the accord - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union - who say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution.

Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran’s state matters, welcomed European support but said it was not sufficient.

“European states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned Trump ... We welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask Trump not to rip up the agreement. Europe needs to stand against practical measures (taken) by America.”

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy, and U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly certified Tehran’s compliance with the terms.

Trump accuses Iran of supporting terrorism and says the 2015 deal does not do enough to block its path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran says it does not seek nuclear arms and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.

In decertifying the nuclear deal last week, Trump gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact.

“DO NOT INTERFERE”

In a major shift in U.S. policy, Trump also said Washington will take a more confrontational approach to Iran over its ballistic missile program and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East.

Tehran has repeatedly pledged to continue what it calls a defensive missile capability in defiance of Western criticism. The United States has said Iran’s stance violates the 2015 deal in spirit as missiles could be tipped with nuclear weapons.

Tehran has said it seeks only civilian nuclear energy from its enrichment of uranium, and that the program has nothing to do with missile development efforts.

EU foreign ministers on Monday urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran but also discussed Iran’s missile program, which they want to see dismantled.

“They must avoid interfering in our defense program ... We do not accept that Europe sings along with America’s bullying and its unreasonable demands,” Khamenei said.

“They (Europeans) ask why does Iran have missiles? Why do you have missiles yourselves? Why do you have nuclear weapons?”

The Trump administration has imposed new unilateral sanctions targeting Iran’s missile activity. It has called on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans.

Iran has one of the biggest ballistic missile programs in the Middle East, viewing it as an essential precautionary defense against the United States and other adversaries, primarily Gulf Arab states and Israel.

“Americans are angry because the Islamic Republic of Iran has managed to thwart their plots in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries in the region,” Khamenei said.

Supporters of the deal fear Trump’s decision to decertify the deal could eventually unravel it, causing more tension in the crisis-hit Middle East, where Shi‘ite Iran is involved in a decades long proxy war with U.S. ally Sunni Saudi Arabia.

If the deal falls apart, Iran’s anti-Western hardliners will gain authority in a backlash against pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani, who engineered the accord to help end Iran’s political and economic isolation, analysts and insiders say.",Khamenei says Iran will 'shred' nuclear deal if U.S. quits it,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-usa-khamenei/khamenei-says-iran-will-shred-nuclear-deal-if-u-s-quits-it-idUKKBN1CN16H

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The Trump administration said last week it would stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help lower-income Americans pay medical expenses, part of the Republican president’s effort to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law.

The subsidies to private insurers cost the government an estimated $7 billion this year and were forecast at $10 billion for 2018. Trump’s move to scuttle them had raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets.

Trump hoped to make good on his campaign promise to dismantle the law when he took office in January, with Republicans, who pledged for seven years to scrap it, controlling Congress. But he has been frustrated with their failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace it.

Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans. Republicans say it is ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.

The Alexander-Murray plan could keep Obamacare in place at least until the 2020 presidential campaign starts heating up.

“This takes care of the next two years. After that, we can have a full-fledged debate on where we go long-term on healthcare,” Alexander said of the deal.

It is unclear whether the agreement can make it through Congress.

Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said it had “broad support” among senators in his party, but it was harder to gauge possible support among Republicans.

Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who helped sink earlier Obamacare repeal legislation, voiced backing for the new plan, but conservative Republicans may be less welcoming.

Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, threw his weight behind the effort. In an interview with Reuters, Sanders said Alexander was a “well-respected figure” known for bipartisanship and that the Tennessee senator’s reputation would help propel the legislation through the Senate.

The willingness of Sanders, a liberal champion, to offer his support of a deal with Republicans that could allow states to change some Obamacare requirements provided a boost to the Alexander-Murray effort. ”We are going to overturn what Trump is trying to do,” Sanders said.

Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the plan to a vote on the Senate floor and urged the House of Representatives to take it up then as quickly as possible so Trump can sign it.

TRUMP STILL SEEKS LONG-TERM SOLUTION

Trump, during comments at the White House, suggested he could get behind the Alexander-Murray plan as a short-term solution.

In remarks later at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, Trump commended the work by Alexander and Murray, but said: “I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

Trump said earlier he wanted lawmakers, once they completed a major tax reform effort, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Alexander is its chairman.

She said the two were able to find common ground on the steps aimed at stabilizing the insurance markets created under Obamacare and to “help protect families from premium spikes as a result of the sabotage we have seen from this administration.”

According to a document seen by Reuters, the plan would make it easier for states to get waivers approved that would allow them to offer cheaper healthcare plans, including catastrophic health plans, which cover a limited set of benefits and are currently only available to those under 30.

Shares of U.S. hospital operators, including Tenet Healthcare Corp and HCA Healthcare Inc, moved higher after news of the deal. Tenet shares closed 5.3 percent higher, while HCA rose 2.2 percent. Shares of some U.S. health insurers also extended their gains on the day, with Anthem Inc finishing up 1.9 percent and Centene Corp gaining 3.2 percent.

Analyst Brian Tanquilut of global investment banking firm Jefferies, who focuses on hospital companies, said that if the deal is passed in Congress, it should stabilize the Obamacare insurance exchanges and improve their viability.

“Hospitals will avoid a potential spike in bad debt and charity care next year,” Tanquilut said. “This is obviously a good step. It’s bipartisan and guaranteed for two years.”","U.S. senators reach bipartisan deal on Obamacare, Trump indicates support",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/u-s-senators-reach-bipartisan-deal-on-obamacare-trump-indicates-support-idUSKBN1CM2PW?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Appealing for information to help identify the conman, Branson said he suspected the same person had later impersonated him to steal $2 million from a friend of his by pretending to raise funds for people affected by Hurricane Irma.

“This story sounds like it has come straight out of a John le Carre book or a James Bond film, but it is sadly all true,” Branson wrote in a blog.

Instantly recognizable with his wavy blond hair and beard, Branson is one of Britain’s best-known businessmen. The Virgin brand is licensed for use by a range of businesses from airlines to train companies to telecoms and gyms.

Branson wrote that six months ago, after an elaborate set-up involving a note on fake government notepaper, he spoke on the phone to someone purporting to be Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

The man told Branson that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held for ransom by terrorists.

He said that while the government did not pay ransoms, there was a particularly sensitive reason why the diplomat had to be saved, and the government was confidentially asking a syndicate of British business people to step in.

“I was asked to contribute $5 million of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back,” Branson wrote.

Feeling suspicious, Branson checked with the government and was told that Fallon had not spoken to him. The matter was reported to the police.

Six months on, Branson learnt that a friend, whom he described as a very successful businessman in the United States, had been called by a conman posing as him.

“When the call happened, the conman did an extremely accurate impression of me and spun a big lie about urgently needing a loan while I was trying to mobilize aid in the BVI (British Virgin Islands),” he wrote.

Branson owns a small island in the BVI archipelago which, as was well publicized, was devastated by Hurricane Irma. The caller took advantage of that context.

“They claimed I couldn’t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn’t have any communications going to Europe and I’d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America,” Branson wrote.

“The business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2 million, which promptly disappeared.”

Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, who reached the agreement with Democratic Senator Patty Murray, said Trump had “completely engineered” the proposal.

The agreement would provide billions of dollars of subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. Trump last week announced he would end the subsidies, potentially creating chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.

“I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O‘Care,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

In another setback, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan indicated no interest in the Alexander-Murray agreement.

“The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

While the proposal drew broad Democratic support, it remained unclear whether the agreement will even come to a vote in the Senate and House, both controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority but other than Alexander, Susan Collins and John McCain are the only Republican senators who have publicly embraced the plan.

On Tuesday, Trump had indicated support of the agreement during a news conference, saying the White House had been involved in the negotiations and that the agreement would be a “short-term solution” that would “get us over this intermediate hump.”

During Tuesday’s news conference, he also made clear that he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and that he still considered the subsidies a government handout that had enriched insurance companies.

He also told a conservative think thank, “While I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray ... I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.”

The Trump administration followed through on the president’s plan to end the subsidies and did not make a payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to insurers that had been scheduled for Wednesday.

MORE FLEXIBILITY

The Alexander-Murray proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

The subsidies compensate private insurers for reducing deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses for low-income customers. They are known as cost-sharing reduction payments.

At an event sponsored by the news website Axios shortly before Trump posted his tweet on Wednesday, Alexander said, “Trump completely engineered the plan that we announced yesterday.”

“He wanted a bipartisan bill for the short term,” Alexander added.

Collins, a moderate who helped kill earlier Senate efforts to repeal and replace the healthcare law, said she did not know if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would schedule a vote but told CNN, “If it comes to the floor, I think the votes are there.”

The president’s move last week to discontinue subsidies was part of his effort to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through executive actions because his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to pass legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Trump said on Tuesday he wanted lawmakers, once they have completed work on his tax-cut proposal, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states.

Republicans, describing Obamacare as ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy, have sought for seven years to repeal and replace it. Scrapping the law was also a top Trump campaign pledge.

Democrats have fought to defend Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans.

“We will now get to a competitive wage level,” a spokesman for the works council said on Wednesday after a staff gathering at Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH, based in western Germany.

“The workforce was informed today that we will introduce a pay structure” at Grohmann, which has about 650 workers, he said, without elaborating.

In an emailed statement, Tesla said the new remuneration structure, retroactively effective from Oct. 1, guarantees staff “a fair and competitive salary” and will include a pay raise for apprenticeships, but it did not confirm the 30 percent figure.

In April, Tesla pledged a 5-year job guarantee for all Grohmann employees up to at least 2022. Workers also received a 10,000-euro (£8,940) grant each of Tesla stock and an additional bonus of 1,000 euros with their April pay and a monthly salary increase of 150 euros, it said.

Tesla faces higher wage costs in Germany as it wrestles with what Chief Executive Elon Musk has described as “production hell” in launching its new Model 3 sedan, which Tesla hopes will make it a mass-market producer.

The company warned earlier this month that production bottlenecks had left the company behind with its planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

German daily newspaper Die Welt reported the wage pact earlier on Wednesday.

Before being bought by Tesla last year, Grohmann, based in the town of Pruem near the Luxembourg border, helped clients build highly automated and efficient factories, including battery assembly lines for electric cars.

The U.S. carmaker is counting on Grohmann’s automation and engineering expertise to help it ramp up production to 500,000 cars per year by 2018 through the design of ultra-efficient factories.",Tesla to raise pay by 30 percent at German division - works council,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-tesla-germany-wages/tesla-to-raise-pay-by-30-percent-at-german-division-works-council-idUKKBN1CN283?il=0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street hit new records on strong earnings and the dollar extended a winning streak on Wednesday, boosted by rising Treasury yields as investors focused on monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury yields hit years-long highs and the difference in yield between U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasuries fell to the lowest since November 2007 as expectations for tighter global monetary policy pushed investors to sell shorter-dated Treasuries.

“The general tone from Fed speakers this week has been more on the hawkish side,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. “That and the global removal of accommodation is something markets have noticed.”

Rajappa said U.S. yields were rising in concert with European government bonds on expectations the European Central Bank, could signal a rollback of monetary stimulus on Thursday.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was boosted by strong earnings from heavyweight International Business Machines (IBM.N), which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average open above 23,000 for the first time.

“We’re in a sweet spot where the economy is growing not too strong and not too weak, the Fed’s tightening but not too rapidly, and earnings continue to expand. All the news is positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 121.94 points, or 0.53 percent, to 23,119.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.2 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,560.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.06 points, or 0 percent, to 6,623.72.

Meanwhile, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.3447 percent, from 2.298 percent late on Tuesday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 32/32 in price to yield 2.8531 percent, from 2.803 percent late on Tuesday.

The dollar rose for a fifth straight day, boosted by soaring Treasury yields.

The dollar index .DXY rose 0.09 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.05 percent to $1.1772.

“It’s all about the yields this week, so far,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. [L8N1MT3Q4]

In Europe, stocks edged up with a raft of company results in focus. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.22 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.11 percent.[.EU]

In commodity markets, Brent oil prices retreated from three-week highs reached earlier in the day on Wednesday and U.S. crude declined, after a surprising fall-off in U.S. refining runs boosted inventories of gasoline and diesel.

U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.25 percent to $51.75 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.85, down 0.05 percent on the day.

Gold fell for a third straight session on pressure from a firmer dollar amid speculation that the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve could be a policy hawk. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.3 percent to $1,280.53 an ounce.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A second U.S. federal judge has blocked parts of President Donald Trump’s latest travel ban on people entering the United States from eight countries, dealing another legal blow to the administration’s third bid to impose travel restrictions.

U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, in a ruling issued overnight, said the policy as applied to six majority-Muslim countries likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on religious discrimination. He also ruled the ban ran afoul of immigration law.

Trump’s ban would have taken effect on Wednesday but was blocked on Tuesday by a U.S. federal judge in Hawaii in a separate challenge.

Together, the pair of rulings set up a high-stakes battle over the president’s executive authority that is expected to ultimately wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump’s latest order targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. Neither of the court rulings lifts the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela.

In the Maryland ruling, Chuang questioned the government’s argument that the restrictions are needed until the affected countries provide more information on travelers to the United States.

He cited various statements made by Trump, including his 2015 call for a “total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States.”

Chuang wrote that the president’s public statements “not only fail to advance, but instead undermine, the position that the primary purpose of the travel ban now derives from the need to address information sharing deficiencies.”

The latest ban, announced last month, was the third version of a policy that targeted Muslim-majority countries but had been restricted by the courts. The Maryland case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project.

“Like the two versions before it, President Trump’s latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core. And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts,” said ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu said Hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that the policy violated federal immigration law. The White House called the ruling flawed and said it would appeal.

Unlike the Hawaii ruling, the Maryland decision would lift the restrictions only for people with family connections to the United States.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new fund will let robots pick stocks.

The AI Powered Equity Exchange-Traded Fund (AIEQ.P), which launched in the United States on Wednesday, will use IBM Corp’s (IBM.N) Watson artificial intelligence technology to pick several dozen stocks with potential to beat the market, the fund’s backers say.

The actively managed fund chooses stocks based on a set of rules created by EquBot LLC that uses artificial intelligence to analyze up to 10 years of data on thousands of stocks, including market sentiment, regulatory filings, news articles and social media posts.

It ranks each company based on the forecasted probability that each will profit from current economic conditions and world events.

“There has been an explosion of information,” Art Amador, co-founder of EquBot, said in an interview.

The explosion of data from the internet and elsewhere needs to be processed objectively, he said. “Humans do not have the capacity or the retention rate to do that.”

AI involves computers combing through troves of raw data to recognize patterns and predict outcomes, and joins a set of technologies displacing traditional - human - equity analysis.

Index-tracking ETFs have grown popular for letting investors trade entire markets as easily as a single stock, with no research necessary.

Even investors hoping to beat the market have increasingly turned to algorithms to pick stocks with attractive prospects.

Starting in 2019, the Chartered Financial Analyst exam that is a respected license for portfolio managers will add questions on artificial intelligence, automated investment services and mining unconventional sources of data.

The fund technically does have two human managers, Timothy Collins and Travis Trampe of ETF Managers Group LLC, though they will be “primarily making purchase and sale decisions based on information” from the computer model, according to the fund’s offering documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent of GDP, and may accelerate sales of government stakes in lenders and other companies as part of an effort to recapitalize banks, an adviser to the prime minister said on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has already used up nearly all of its budget for the current fiscal year and tax revenues are expected to fall far short of initial expectations. At the same time economic growth has slowed, sparking calls for more stimulus.

But Surjit Bhalla, a member of Modi’s Economic Advisory Council, told Reuters in an interview, that the government had stuck to its fiscal deficit targets over the past three years and is expected to do so this year as well.

The central bank has warned that missing the fiscal deficit target could lead to a spike in inflation, hurting macro-economic stability. Indian stocks slid last month on reports that a stimulus package worth up to 500 billion Indian rupees ($7.7 billion) might be in works - one that would widen the deficit to 3.7 percent of GDP.

Economic growth slipped to its lowest level in three years in the first quarter, logging an annual rate of 5.7 percent, but Bhalla said there were signs of recovery.

“I am more optimistic on the economy than I was two weeks ago,” he said, adding that last week’s industrial output and export data suggested fears about a slowdown were exaggerated.

Speaking at his home office in New Delhi, he said that GDP growth could be close to 6.5 percent for the fiscal year - although that forecast is lower than the central bank’s latest estimate of 6.7 percent.

Modi formed the Economic Advisory Council last month to address issues of macroeconomic importance and present its views to the prime minister. Bhalla said the council’s views on the fiscal deficit has been communicated to the government by its chairman, Bibek Debroy.

BANKING WOES

Sour loans in India’s banking sector hit a record 9.5 trillion rupees ($146 billion) at the end of June with stressed loans as a percentage of total loans at 12.6 percent - the highest level in at least 15 years.

That represents a major problem for Asia’s third largest economy, as provisions eat into profits and new lending is choked off. The bulk of the sector’s bad loans are held by the country’s 21 state-run banks.

Asked how much it would take to recapitalize state-run banks, Bhalla said: “My reading is that it would probably require about 1 trillion rupees ($15.4 billion).”

In contrast, Moody’s expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion, while Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules.

Bhalla added the government could speed up the sale of its stakes in state-run banks and other companies to fund the recapitalization.

The government has allocated $3 billion in its budget for bank recapitalization, but senior finance ministry officials say a decision on an infusion of more funds could be taken by end-December.","India likely to stick to deficit target, may step up bank reform: Modi adviser",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-modi-adviser/exclusive-india-likely-to-stick-to-deficit-target-may-step-up-bank-reform-modi-adviser-idINKBN1CM0UU

Such imperatives are understandable in the case of Credit Suisse. Shares in the Swiss lender are 13 percent below the price at which it raised money from investors in 2015 and have underperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index by 23 percent since Tidjane Thiam became chief executive. Even so, a plan to split the Zurich-based group into three faces a capital markets conundrum.

Activist investor RBR Capital Advisors thinks a breakup would unlock hidden value. On paper, it appears to have a case. Valuing Credit Suisse’s private banking and asset management businesses at peer multiples, based on 2016 earnings and taxed at 20 percent, yields a market value of 39 billion Swiss francs, roughly equal to the bank’s current worth. That implies investors are getting the corporate and investment banking divisions for nothing. The involvement as an adviser of Gael de Boissard, a former Credit Suisse investment bank co-head passed over for the top job in favour of Thiam, adds a personal edge to the campaign.

Alas, RBR’s clarion cry is drowned out by the practicalities in executing its vision. It is not clear who would want to invest in a standalone investment bank which is sub-scale, doesn’t yet earn its cost of equity, and has to fund itself through wholesale markets. Even the mighty Goldman Sachs – the only major investment bank not shackled to a large retail banking or wealth management business – struggles to earn a 10 percent return on equity. Moreover, Credit Suisse’s investment bank is intertwined with its wealth management businesses, in line with Thiam’s plan to provide advisory and capital markets services to rich clients. Untangling them would damage both franchises.

Then there is 223 billion Swiss francs of derivatives on Credit Suisse’s balance sheet. These require collateral and benefit from the group’s investment-grade credit rating when it comes to measuring counterparty risk. Placing them in a low-returning investment bank could jeopardise that rating, driving up funding costs.

There is some evidence Thiam’s turnaround plan is working: the lender has reported higher year-on-year net revenue and lower costs in each of the last three quarters. If that trend continues, RBR will face silence. If not, the clamour for change will grow louder – not just in terms of strategy, but leadership too.",Breakingviews - Credit Suisse breakup faces trading conundrum,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-creditsuisse-rbr-breakingviews/breakingviews-credit-suisse-breakup-faces-trading-conundrum-idUSKBN1CM1QL

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A year-old pact underpinning billions of dollars of transatlantic data transfers won a green light from the European Union on Wednesday after a first review to ensure Washington protects Europeans’ data stored on U.S. servers.

The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was agreed last year after everyday cross-border data transfers were plunged into limbo when the EU’s top court struck down a previous data transfer pact in 2015 because it allowed U.S. spies excessive access to people’s data.

The European Commission last month conducted its first annual review of the framework as it seeks to ensure the United States lives up to its promises to better protect Europeans’ data when they are transferred across the Atlantic - failing which it could suspend the Privacy Shield.

The EU executive said it was satisfied that the framework continues to ensure adequate protection for Europeans’ personal data although it asked Washington to improve the way it works, including by strengthening the privacy protections contained in a controversial portion of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

The conclusion will come as a relief to the more than 2,400 companies signed up to the scheme, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook and Microsoft, especially since the Privacy Shield is already being challenged in court by privacy activists.

The Commission said the U.S. Department of Commerce should be more pro-active in monitoring companies’ compliance with the privacy obligations in the framework.

“Transatlantic data transfers are essential for our economy, but the fundamental right to data protection must be ensured also when personal data leaves the EU. Our first review shows that the Privacy Shield works well, but there is some room for improving its implementation,” EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said.

Companies wanting to transfer Europeans’ personal data outside the bloc have to comply with tough EU data protection rules which forbid them from transferring personal data to countries deemed to have inadequate privacy protections unless they have special legal contracts in place.

The Privacy Shield allows firms to move data across the Atlantic without relying on such contracts, known as model clauses, which are more cumbersome and expensive.

The Commission urged the United States to appoint a permanent Privacy Shield Ombudsperson - a new office that was created to deal with complaints from EU citizens about U.S. spying, but which is currently only filled on an “acting” basis.

It also urged Washington to fill empty posts on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

In addition, the Commission said it would welcome privacy protections for foreigners contained in a Presidential Policy Directive issued by former U.S. President Barack Obama being enshrined in FISA.

Section 702 of FISA - that allows the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to collect and analyze emails and other digital communications of foreigners living overseas - will expire at the end of the year unless it is re-authorized by the U.S. Congress.",EU-U.S. data transfer pact passes first annual review,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CN0DY-OCATC

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday laid out a confident vision for a more prosperous nation and its role in the world, stressing the importance of wiping out corruption and curbing industrial overcapacity, income inequality and pollution.

Opening a critical Communist Party congress, Xi pledged to build a “modern socialist country” for a “new era” that will be proudly Chinese and steadfastly ruled by the party but open to the world.

Although his wide-ranging address made clear there were no plans for political reform, Xi said China’s development had entered a “new era”, using the phrase 36 times in a speech that ran nearly 3-1/2 hours.

“With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era,” Xi said.

The twice-a-decade event, a weeklong, mostly closed-door conclave, will culminate in the selection of a new Politburo Standing Committee to rule China’s 1.4 billion people for the next five years, with Xi expected to consolidate his control and potentially retain power beyond 2022, when the next congress takes place.

The 64-year-old Xi, widely regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, spoke to more than 2,000 delegates in Beijing's cavernous, red-carpeted Great Hall of the People, including 91-year-old former president Jiang Zemin. Security was tight on a rainy, smoggy day in the capital.

As expected, the speech was heavy on aspiration and short on specific plans.

On the economy, Xi said China would relax market access for foreign investment, expand access to its services sector and deepen market-oriented reform of its exchange rate and financial system, while at the same time strengthening state firms.

During Xi’s first term, China disappointed many investors who had expected it to usher in more market-oriented reforms, especially in the debt-laden state sector.

“If Xi gets the political mandate that he is expected to out of the congress, then my hope is that the state sector reforms actually get done,” Damien Ma, fellow and associate director at U.S. thinktank the Paulson Institute, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.

“If not, then I would also revise my assessment of the state of reforms in China. There have been talks in Beijing that the state sector will be a focus after the 19th party congress, so we need to see.”

The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said it welcomed commitments to open wider the door and treat all companies equally, but said European companies operating in China continued to suffer from “promise fatigue”.

“The only cure for this is promise implementation,” it said in a statement.

In what was probably an indirect reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy, Xi promised that China would be fully engaged with the world, and reiterated pledges to tackle climate change. Trump this year opted to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate pact.

“No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation,” Xi told the delegates, among them Buddhist monks, Olympic medallists, farmers and at least one astronaut.

Xi set bold long-term goals for China’s development, envisioning it as a “basically” modernised socialist country by 2035, and a modern socialist “strong power” with leading influence on the world stage by 2050.

But he signalled there would be no significant political reforms, calling China’s system the broadest, most genuine, and most effective way to safeguard the interests of the people.

Xi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on civil society, locking up rights lawyers and dissidents and tightening internet controls as he has sought to revitalise the Communist Party and its place in contemporary China.

“We should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries,” he said. “We must unwaveringly uphold and improve party leadership and make the party still stronger.”

FIRM ON GRAFT, TAIWAN

Xi praised the party’s successes, particularly his high-profile anti-graft campaign, in which more than a million officials have been punished and dozens of former senior officials jailed, saying it would never end as corruption was the “gravest threat” the party faces.

On self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own, Xi said China would never allow the island to separate from China, adding that China would strive to fully transform its armed forces into a world-class military by the mid-21st century.

He made no mention of neighbouring North Korea, which has angered Beijing with repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. Pyongyang sent a congratulatory message ahead of the meeting.

Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, restructuring the military and asserting China’s rising might on the world stage.

Focus at the congress will be on how Xi plans to use his expanded authority, and moves to enable him to stay on in a leadership capacity after his second term ends in 2022.

That could include resurrecting the position of party chairman, a title that would put him on par with Mao, the founding father of modern China.

“In all aspects he is on the right track to be our next Chairman Mao,” Su Shengcheng, a delegate from the northwestern province of Qinghai, told Reuters. “He will lead the party and Central Committee to continue its way to success.”

As with other major set-piece events in the capital, Beijing has been blanketed with security in the run-up to the congress, with long queues of passengers at some subway stations waiting to go through metal detectors and be patted down.

Large red banners plastered around Beijing trumpet the congress, while censors have stepped up already tight monitoring of the internet.

Tencent Holdings Ltd’s WeChat, China’s top social media platform with more than 960 million users, said late on Tuesday that “system maintenance” would render users unable to alter profile pictures, nicknames and tag lines until month-end.

The Sept 25 vote won overwhelming backing for secession but has raised the possibility of a new civil war in Iraq that could draw in regional powers. Baghdad says the vote is illegal.

Just a few months ago, the Iraqi army, Kurdish fighters, known as the Peshmerga, and Iranian-backed Shi‘ite paramilitary forces worked together to defeat Islamic State in Mosul.

But that cooperation was short-lived and on Monday Iraqi forces seized Kirkuk -- an important oil town for the OPEC producer that is also considered by the Kurds to be the heart of their homeland.

Iran and Turkey oppose Kurdish independence and Shi‘ite militias funded by Tehran are gaining influence across Iraq. Meanwhile divisions between the two parties in the ruling Kurdish coalition have deepened.

“Kurds have been managing these areas since the fall of (Iraqi President) Saddam (Hussein) in 2003 and to change the situation in an instant will make the whole situation as if it is sinking into quicksand,” said Baghdad-based analyst Jasim al-Bahadli, an expert on Shi’ite armed groups.

He said the Shi’ite paramilitary groups’ presence in areas that used to be controlled by Kurds will help create tensions that could lead to a long-term conflict.

”Sensitivities could develop into hostilities that could spark a civil war,” he said.

LEADERSHIP CRISIS

Barzani and his Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) have defended the referendum.

“It was the right move. No one will stop us from achieving independence,” his spokesman Vahal Ali said.

But not all of Iraq’s Kurds, who fought a bloody civil war amongst themselves in the 1990s, supported the idea, raising doubts over the management of any independent state.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said the KDP, who make up the coalition, were putting Kurds at risk because of strong opposition to the vote, including from key ally the United States.

The Peshmerga General Command in the KDP stronghold of Erbil accused Iran, a historical ally of the PUK, of helping Iraqi forces launch the offensive in the Kirkuk area.

“Unfortunately some of the PUK officials betrayed Kurdistan by being part of the plan by abandoning key fronts and leaving…,” said the Peshmerga statement.

“This plot will fail and the will of our people will prevail.”

Ali Akbar Velayati - a top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - was quoted in a report by Tasnim news agency as saying Iran had no role in the Kirkuk operations.

A senior Western diplomat also denied that Iran had played a role.

“This is mythology. Barzani has in the past blamed others for his mistakes including the PUK. But this is mythology designed to get support from the Americans,” he said.

PUK leader Jalal Talabani died barely a week after the vote, adding more uncertainty for the Kurds.

Shuras Sherko Jdy, an official in the main opposition Kurdish Gorran Movement, said the Kurds, who gradually built an autonomous region in the north after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, were facing a leadership crisis.

“Civil war could take place over Kirkuk. I hope it does not. If it does it will encourage the intervention of Iran and Turkey,” he said.

TEHRAN‘S AMBITIONS

But Iran, like Turkey, worries the vote will encourage their own Kurdish populations to push for homelands and has made no secret of its growing ambitions in Iraq.

The most prominent Iranian figure in Iraq is Major General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of foreign operations for Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, a military corp providing training and weapons to Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi‘ite-led government in Baghdad.

Ali said Soleimani appeared in Kirkuk two nights before Iraqi security forces attacked. That account was confirmed by an Iranian source in Iraq who said he appeared for “a couple of hours there to give military guidance.”

“Tehran’s military help is not a secret anymore. You can find General Soleimani’s pictures in Iraq everywhere,” said an official close to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

“Now, beside political issues, Kirkuk’s oil is a very key element for Iran, which is an OPEC member. Control of those oil fields by Iran’s enemies, would be disastrous for us. Why should we let them enter the oil market?.”

Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire and left Kurdish-populated territory split between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

They have often accused the West of not helping them during times of trouble. President Donald Trump has said the United States would not take sides in the clash.

Some fear the referendum, which gave Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi a chance to assert his authority, has put independence further out of reach.

Baghdad has also banned international flights to Kurdish airports and imposed punitive financial measures.

“We used to control our own airports. We used to control our own borders. We were running our own autonomous region...Now we have nothing. Barzani is responsible for this,” said Jdy.",Vote may have put independence out of reach for Iraqi Kurds,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds/analysis-vote-may-have-put-independence-out-of-reach-for-iraqi-kurds-idINKBN1CN1OR

(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines Inc (IBM.N) surged 9 percent on Wednesday after it beat expectations on revenue and gave an outlook that hinted one of the world’s first big computing names was back on a growth track after six years in retreat.

There was no initial sign of changes to major brokerage ratings and most analysts shied away from calling a complete turnaround in the company’s fortunes.

But both Citi and Barclays raised their price targets for the stock, helping it towards its biggest daily percentage gain since 2009 -- a stark contrast with a nearly 12 percent fall so far this year.

The rise in the share price, last at $159.79, added $12.6 billion to the company’s market value and accounted for nearly 90 of the 105 point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday.

“After a difficult first half, IBM turned in a solid quarter last night and we continue to believe the company will emerge from this transition a much stronger IT organization,” Drexel Hamilton Brian White wrote in a client note.

He has a “buy” rating on the stock and a $200 price target.

Another analyst, Jefferies John DiFucci, argued that while IBM has struggled more than peers such as Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to adjust to a changing market, the quarterly performance of its software business was noteworthy.

He warned against reading across from the firm’s results to others in the sector.

“IBM has historically served as an indicator of overall software industry health, and as the world’s 3rd largest software vendor, its results are relevant,” he said.

“But we caution against direct read-throughs to other companies in recent times due to company-specific and secular challenges IBM has faced.”

Revenue at the company, one of the world’s original PC producers but now a broad-based producer, integrator and software maker, has fallen for 22 straight quarters.

Weak demand from customers had left its legacy hardware and software businesses stagnating.

The results showed revenue from IBM’s cloud, cybersecurity and data analytics business rose 11 percent to $8.8 billion in the quarter, accounting for about 46 percent of total revenue.

The company’s software revenue also grew for the first time after 13 consecutive quarters of declines.

“We were pleased to see the quality of IBM’s earnings improve, with IP income and taxes being less of a driver of upside than in prior quarters,” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a note.

But she added: “We see the business as secularly challenged due to its high exposure to a legacy business model, and see continued margin pressure over the long-term as IBM’s business is pressured by competition from lower-cost offerings and the cloud.”

Out of 25 analysts covering the stock, only 6 have a “buy” or higher rating, 15 are on “hold”, and 4 have a “sell” or lower. They have a median price target of $154.50.

“The bottom line, IBM remains in a ”work-in-progress“ mode, as its continues to convert its revenue base away from asset/labor intensive legacy into asset/labor light ”digital“ solutions,” Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said.",IBM shares head for biggest gain in eight years,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-results-research/ibm-shares-head-for-biggest-gain-in-eight-years-idUKKBN1CN1MA

The U.N. health body initially raised the alarm on Monday after initial tests on a 34-year-old man who had arrived from Madagascar. A confirmed case would have marked the first recorded appearance of the disease on the Indian Ocean island chain.

But all 10 samples have now tested negative for plague at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the WHO said in a statement.

”We are working with health authorities to reduce the risk of the spread of plague in the Seychelles by improving surveillance and preparedness,” said Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, WHO regional emergencies director for the Africa region.

Plague, which is mainly spread by flea-carrying rats, is endemic in Madagascar where 805 cases have been reported since late August, including 74 deaths, the Madagascar health ministry said in a statement posted on Facebook late on Monday.

Nearly 600 of the reported cases in Madagascar were the pneumonic form, which is spread human-to-human and is more dangerous than bubonic plague spread by fleas, it said.

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average stayed above the 23,000-mark in late morning trading on Wednesday with solid support from IBM, which reported strong earnings.

Shares of IBM (IBM.N) surged 9 percent and accounted for nearly 92 of the 136 point gain in the blue-chip index, after the company signaled it was back on growth path.

The Dow had briefly surpassed the all-time peak on Tuesday but closed 3 points short of the record level. The latest 1,000-point increase was covered in roughly half the time it took the index to move from 21,000 to 22,000.

Solid earnings and hopes that President Donald Trump may be able to make progress on tax cuts have helped the market rally this year.

“We continue to see solid numbers above expectations, stability in terms of economic growth and global growth,” said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.

“Announcements by the ECB next week and decision by the Fed in December will probably have a higher impact on whether or not we continue this rally.”

The dollar climbed higher, tracking higher U.S. Treasury yields, while news on a potential new hawkish Federal Reserve chair and the slow progress of U.S. tax reforms also supported the greenback. [USD/]

Investors are also awaiting the Fed’s issue of the Beige Book, a periodic snapshot on the health of the U.S. economy. The report, due at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), will likely show if inflation pressures are accelerating.

At 11:06 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 132.35 points, or 0.58 percent, at 23,129.79, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 1.96 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,561.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 2.67 points, or 0.04 percent, at 6,626.33.

The S&P and the tech-heavy Nasdaq also hit record highs but traded in narrow ranges. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by 0.47 percent drop in the telecom services index .SPLRCL, followed by 0.42 percent slide in the utilities index .SPLRCU.

Financial stocks .SPSY gained 0.54 percent, tracking a surge in U.S. treasury yields.

Shares of big banks Wells Fargo (WFC.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose between 0.84 percent and 1.83 percent.

Abbott (ABT.N) rose 1.54 percent after the company’s profit beat estimates on strong sales in its medical devices business.

Anthem (ANTM.N) gained about 3.83 percent after the health insurer said it signed an agreement with CVS Health (CVS.N) to support the company’s new pharmacy benefit management business.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) slipped 1.85 percent after Bank of America Merrill downgraded the company’s stock to “underperform” and slashed its price target by $105 to $285.

“Han sido muchos años de trayectoria en los que he puesto el cuerpo al límite en muchas ocasiones”, dijo Beitia en una rueda de prensa en su ciudad, Santander, acompañada de su entrenador Ramón Torralbo.

“La situación a la que me enfrento es que dejo mi carrera deportiva, todo lo que he aprendido me toca llevarlo a otros aspectos de la vida”.

La atleta ha combinado su cartera deportiva con la política desde que fue elegida como diputada en el Parlamento de Cantabria con el Partido Popular en 2011.

“Todos esos valores que he aprendido y todo lo que nos ha enseñado el deporte y me ha ocurrido con Ramón me toca llevarlos a otro aspecto de la vida”, añadió.

Sin embargo, recibió el premio ‘Juego Limpio’ de la IAAF en el Mundial de Londres por consolar a su rival italiana Alessia Trost tras su eliminación.

Beitia se retiró temporalmente del deporte en 2012 tras estar cerca de conseguir su primera medalla olímpica en los Juegos de Londres, pero volvió a entrenar dos meses después.

“Se retira la más grande de nuestra historia”, dijo Raúl Chapado, presidente de la Federación Española de atletismo.
