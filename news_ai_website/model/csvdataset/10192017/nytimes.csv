So many people do not realize they are bad men.
So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry.
There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men.

So many people want to believe there are only a few bad men. So many people want to believe they don’t know any bad men. So many people do not realize they are bad men. So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry. There is no escaping the inappropriate attentions and intentions of men.

These same people buy into the myth that there are ways women can avoid sexual violence and harassment — if we act nicer or drink less or dress less provocatively or smile or show a little gratitude or, or, or — because boys will be boys, because men are so fragile, so frenzied with sexual need that they cannot simply control themselves and their baser impulses.

Some people insinuate that women themselves can stave off attacks. They insist we can wear modest clothes or be grateful for unconventional looks, or that we can avoid “asking for it” by “presenting all the sensuality and the sexuality,” as Donna Karan has said. With each of these betrayals, the burden we all carry grows heavier.

What this reasoning does not grapple with — and it is a perennial rejoinder to discussions of sexual assault and women’s vulnerability — is that no one escapes unwanted male attention because they don’t meet certain beauty standards or because they don’t dress a certain way. They escape because they are lucky.

Sexual violence is about power. There is a sexual component, yes, but mostly it’s about someone exerting his or her will over another and deriving pleasure and satisfaction from that exertion. We cannot forget this, or the women and men who have been harassed or assaulted but aren’t “conventionally attractive” will be ignored, silenced, or worse, disbelieved.

And then there are the ways that women diminish their experiences as “not that bad.” Because it was just a cat call. It was just a man grabbing me. It was just a man shoving me up against a wall. It was just a man raping me. He didn’t have a weapon. He stopped following me after 10 blocks. He didn’t leave many bruises. He didn’t kill me, therefore it is not that bad. Nothing I deal with in this country compares with what women in other parts of the world deal with. We offer up this refrain over and over because that is what we need to tell ourselves, because if we were to face how bad it really is, we might not be able to shoulder the burden for one moment longer.

In the wake of the Weinstein allegations, a list appeared online, an anonymous accounting of men in media who have committed a range of infractions from sleazy DMs to rape. And just as quickly as the list appeared, it disappeared. I saw the list. A couple of people didn’t belong on it simply because their behaviors weren’t sexual in nature, but some of them were men whose behavior called for a warning and who deserved public shame. Even where I live, outside the media bubble, in a small town in Indiana, I had already heard some of the stories that were shared.

There are a great many open secrets about bad men.

As the list circulated, there was a lot of hand-wringing about libel and the ethics of anonymous disclosure. There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men. There was concern that the “milder” infractions would be conflated with the more serious ones, as if women lack the capacity for critical thinking and discernment about behaviors that are or are not appropriate in professional contexts. More energy was spent worrying about how men were affected than worrying about the pain women have suffered. Women were not trusted to create a tangible artifact of their experiences so that they might have more to rely upon than the whisper networks women have long cultivated to warn one another about the bad men they encounter.

Meanwhile, there was a hashtag, #metoo — a chorus of women and some men sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Me too, me too, me too. I thought about participating but I was just too tired. I have nothing more to say about my history of violence beyond saying I have been hurt, almost too many times to count. I have been hurt enough that some terrible things no longer even register as pain.

We already know victims’ stories. Women testify about their hurt, publicly and privately, all the time. When this happens, men, in particular, act shocked and surprised that sexual violence is so pervasive because they are afforded the luxury of oblivion. And then they start to panic because not all men are predators and they don’t want to be lumped in with the bad men and they make women’s pain all about themselves. They choose not to face that enough men are predators that women engage in all sorts of protective behaviors and strategies so that they might stop adding to their testimony. And then there are the men who act so overwhelmed, who ask, “What can I possibly do?”

The answer is simple.

Men can start putting in some of the work women have long done in offering testimony. They can come forward and say “me too” while sharing how they have hurt women in ways great and small. They can testify about how they have cornered women in narrow office hallways or made lewd comments to co-workers or refused to take no for an answer or worn a woman down by guilting her into sex and on and on and on. It would equally be a balm if men spoke up about the times when they witnessed violence or harassment and looked the other way or laughed it off or secretly thought a woman was asking for it. It’s time for men to start answering for themselves because women cannot possibly solve this problem they had no hand in creating.","Dear Men: It’s You, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/metoo-sexual-harassment-men.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Instead, Atlanta players have spent the week insisting nothing is wrong with their offense and being annoyed by questions about what a rematch against the Patriots means to them. The Falcons may want to put the drama behind them, but the only way to do that is to march into Foxborough and steal a win on the road. The odds of that currently seem slim. Pick: Patriots

Cardinals at Rams, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: Rams by 3.5

The Cardinals (3-3) found a portal to 2015 last week. Carson Palmer was throwing touchdown passes, Adrian Peterson was slashing through the defense, and the Cardinals ran up a huge lead. The reality of it being 2017, however, began to encroach in the second half, as Tampa Bay nearly stormed back for a comeback win behind Ryan Fitzpatrick, the team’s backup quarterback. It was fun to see Peterson excelling on the field like in the days of yore, but the Rams (4-2) are a much tougher opponent, and their younger stars may have less trouble adjusting to the timing of the game, which will be held at London’s Twickenham Stadium. Pick: Rams

Panthers at Bears, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Panthers by 3

It would be easy to be down on the Panthers (4-2) after Cam Newton’s hot streak came screeching to a halt with three interceptions in a 28-23 loss to Philadelphia. But interceptions, just like losses, are not all created equal. Last week, one of Newton’s interceptions was caused by intense pressure, and the other was a result of his player mistakenly tipping a well-thrown ball to a defender. With a little more luck on either play, the Panthers would be 5-1 and Newton would be in the M.V.P. debate. The Bears (2-4) had considerably better luck in an overtime win over Baltimore that defies description but counted as a win for Mitchell Trubisky no matter how little the rookie quarterback was involved in the final score. Pick: Panthers

Chiefs at Raiders, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL Network

Line: Chiefs by 3

The Chiefs (5-1) are coming off their first defeat of the season, and while they looked awful on Sunday night, they were playing against a Pittsburgh defense that is among the stingiest in the N.F.L. The Raiders (2-4) are better defensively than they were a year ago, but they do not possess the elite speed of the Steelers, and with Kansas City bolstered by Tyreek Hill’s neck injury not proving to be serious, the Chiefs seem poised to get back to their winning ways, sending their rival to a fifth consecutive defeat. Pick: Chiefs

Saints at Packers, 1 p.m., Fox



Line: Saints by 5.5

You will probably hear the name Matt Flynn a lot this week. But regardless of his strong relief performances in 2010 and 2011, the Packers (4-2) of the last few decades simply do not have enough experience playing without an elite quarterback to have any sort of pattern to decipher. In the team’s last 390 regular season games (a streak that stretches back to include Brett Favre’s final 15 seasons with the team), just nine have featured a quarterback starting other than Favre or Aaron Rodgers, and despite Flynn having won four of the games, Green Bay’s record is 4-4-1.

The team is insisting it is comfortable with Brett Hundley at quarterback against the Saints (3-2), and there are a lot of teams the Packers could probably beat through decent work by their front-seven on defense and some shared running between Aaron Jones and Ty Montgomery on offense. But Green Bay will potentially be playing without either of its starting offensive tackles, and that is not a recipe for a rookie quarterback outdueling Drew Brees. Pick: Saints

Ravens at Vikings, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Vikings by 5.5

The Ravens have lost three of their last four games, and the lone win came against Oakland with E.J. Manuel at quarterback. Last week they seemed to show some fight, clawing their way back into a game against Chicago with their return specialists delivering both of the team’s touchdowns and Justin Tucker accounting for the rest of the scoring with field goals. A similarly weird game against the Vikings (4-2) is unlikely, so the Ravens will presumably have to score by finding holes in Minnesota’s defense that just aren’t there. The quarterback position for the Vikings is firmly in Case Keenum’s hands this week, and while it may plunge into chaos once both Sam Bradford and Teddy Bridgewater are healthy, this brief moment of stability is undoubtedly a welcome change. Pick: Vikings

Bengals at Steelers, 4:25 p.m., CBS

Line: Steelers by 5.5

Winning tends to turn the volume down on disagreements, and the Steelers (4-2) did not just beat the previously undefeated Chiefs last week, but they did so by getting fantastic performances from two of the team’s disgruntled stars, Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown. The two accounted for 346 yards from scrimmage, and the team’s defense, as it has all season, simply smothered their opponents’ passing game. A one-week resurgence is not enough to declare Pittsburgh’s offense cured, but each and every week the Steelers’ defense has gone out and made opponents work for every single yard, and the Bengals (2-3) do not seem like a team that can break through against them on the road. Pick: Steelers

Jaguars at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Jaguars by 3

The win-every-other-week pattern is holding strong for the Jaguars (3-3). The team creates many of its own problems — last week 14 of the 27 points they allowed were on special teams plays — creating a frustrating situation in which they can seem like a contender one week and then fall flat on their faces the next. There is no question that the team’s secondary is incredible, and Leonard Fournette, the rookie running back, has lived up to the hype with at least one touchdown in each of his six N.F.L. games thus far. But the Jaguars do not have a quarterback capable of carrying the team to victory when the defense or special teams slip up, so every week will be challenging. Pick: Jaguars

Cowboys at 49ers, 4:05 p.m., Fox

Line: Cowboys by 6

Legal action by the N.F.L. Players’ Association cleared the way for Ezekiel Elliott to play for at least one more week before his suspension proceeds (or is thrown out), which is good news for the Cowboys (2-3) and bad news for the 49ers (0-6). Elliott has had a frustrating sophomore season, but he ran for 116 yards against Green Bay two weeks ago, and coming out of his team’s bye-week he will face an inexperienced front-seven in San Francisco that got even younger when the team released NaVorro Bowman. Pick: Cowboys

Buccaneers at Bills, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: N/A

With a fully-healthy Jameis Winston, the Buccaneers (2-3) would stand a reasonable chance of pulling off a road win in Buffalo, but with the best-case scenario being Winston playing with a sprained AC joint, and the worst being Tampa Bay starting Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Bills (3-2) defense should take care of securing a win. Pick: Bills

Broncos at Chargers, 4:25 p.m., CBS

Line: Chargers by 1

The Chargers cannot hide from the team’s 0-4 start, but they played hard in each of those games and barely lost in three of them. Without changing much, they have suddenly won two in a row, and they may stretch it to three if they can replicate the Giants’ success against the Broncos (3-2). With Melvin Gordon running, Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry at tight end, and the Chargers defense harassing Siemian, they might do just that. Pick: Chargers

Jets at Dolphins, 1 p.m., Fox

Line: Dolphins by 3

The Jets (3-3) had won three consecutive games, and last week they lost one to the Patriots that they probably could have won, if not for an overturned touchdown that seemed suspicious. The Dolphins (3-2) have routinely played poorly, but have also had a knack for bringing their opponents down to their level, which has resulted in a winning record that seems to defy reason considering the team has averaged just 242.8 yards of offense a game, nearly 30 fewer than the team with the second-worst offense (the Bills). With unlikely wins for both teams, picking between them feels like using lottery winnings to buy more lottery tickets, but a tie seems unlikely. Pick: Dolphins

Seahawks at Giants, 4:25 p.m., CBS

Line: Seahawks by 5.5

The Giants (1-5) appear as if they will have an actual wide receiver on the active roster this week, with Sterling Shepard practicing and on track to return to the team after a one-game absence. It would help if he could bring several friends with him, but barring that, the Giants will have to work something out among him, Orleans Darkwa and Evan Engram in hopes of pulling off an upset on their turf against the visiting Seahawks (3-2). Despite their personnel problems, the Giants have managed between 22 and 24 points in each of the team’s last four games, so even if Seattle can come away with the win, covering a spread of more than 5 points seems unlikely. Pick: Giants

Titans at Browns, 1 p.m., CBS

Line: Titans by 6

At some point the Browns (0-6) are going to win a game. There is a reason that there have been only four winless teams in N.F.L. history, and that’s the volatility of the game can lead to even the worst teams occasionally scraping by with a win. For six weeks in a row, everything has gone against Cleveland, but this week they host the Titans (3-3), and with Marcus Mariota somewhat limited by a hamstring injury, the opportunity is there to either win the game or at least cover the 6-point spread. Pick: Browns

Monday’s Matchup

Redskins at Eagles, 8:30 p.m., ESPN

Line: Eagles by 4.5

The standard box score for last week’s game between Philadelphia and Carolina shows the Eagles (5-1) having two sacks. Anyone who watched the game knows that Cam Newton’s day was not nearly so peaceful. Philadelphia’s defense, bolstered by the return of Fletcher Cox, put Newton under intense pressure, recording eight hurries and nine quarterback hits. The pressure played a large part in two of Newton’s three interceptions. This should all be familiar to Washington’s Kirk Cousins, because in Week 1 the Eagles beat the Redskins (3-2) largely through the relentless pressure resulting in five hurries and nine quarterback hits to go with four sacks. Cousins is probably dreading the rematch. Pick: Eagles

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

“It might be the stupidest and most unworthy controversy of the year, and that’s saying something.”

According to Mr. Lowry, the uproar on both sides of the aisle over this issue is misguided. Mr. Trump may have been right that President Obama didn’t call each family of a fallen soldier, but he was nonetheless wrong to “use that point as a bludgeon.” Mr. Lowry adds that while the president’s reported comments to the family of Sergeant. Johnson sounded “horrible in isolation,” there’s no way to properly judge without hearing the entire phone call in context.

Brandon Friedman in The New York Daily News:



“There’s often a misconception among non-veterans that service members sign up with the expectation that they may die. But I can tell you: I did two tours in combat as an infantry officer and I never met a soldier who thought dying was a reasonable result of his or her service.”

If the president did indeed tell Sergeant Johnson’s widow that her husband “knew what he was signing up for” in his call, then, according to Mr. Friedman, he has a poor grasp on how the military actually works. Mr. Friedman, who served two tours of duty and worked in the Obama administration, explains that since the Sept. 11 attacks one out of every 5,000 service members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan died on duty. “This makes it clear that dying in combat is neither common nor expected,” he argues. What “keeps troops going,” he explains, is the faith that your government, and your commander in chief, believe that soldiers’ lives are valuable. “No one shrugs death off as an inevitability.” Read more »

Ameer Hasan Loggins in The Guardian:

“I fully empathize with the family of Sergeant La David Johnson. [...] Sadly, the lack of respect given to them is not an American aberration. It is a part of this country’s ugly history regarding black people and the military.”

When Mr. Loggins heard reports of what Mr. Trump had said to Sergeant Johnson’s family, he recognized it as the latest in a long string of moments black veterans were shown disrespect. Mr. Loggins points out that black troops have disproportionally experienced military punishment — up to, and including, the death penalty. Read more »

Margaret Hartmann in New York Magazine:

“The ongoing dispute over Trump’s treatment of Gold Star families runs the risk of overshadowing a more significant concern: More than two weeks after the attack, we don’t really know what happened in Niger.”

Ms. Hartmann notes that in all the attention paid to the condolence call controversy, most outlets and readers have missed a much more important story: the uncertain events from an attack in Niger that left four soldiers — including Sergeant Johnson — dead. In this piece, she outlines what is known and what questions still remain. Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Leonid Bershidsky in Bloomberg:

“The U.S. demands even more ceremony of its presidents than other countries in part because of the expectation that the head of state is also the moral-authority-in-chief where Christian leadership is prized and the president is expected to channel those attitudes.”

Mr. Bershidsky takes a broader view in his column by examining the symbolic, or ceremonial, function of a U.S. president and how President Trump may or may not fulfill this role.

In the U.S., he notes, policy and ceremony fall to the same person, for better or for worse. Read more »

So many people want to believe there are only a few bad men. So many people want to believe they don’t know any bad men. So many people do not realize they are bad men. So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry. There is no escaping the inappropriate attentions and intentions of men.

These same people buy into the myth that there are ways women can avoid sexual violence and harassment — if we act nicer or drink less or dress less provocatively or smile or show a little gratitude or, or, or — because boys will be boys, because men are so fragile, so frenzied with sexual need that they cannot simply control themselves and their baser impulses.

Some people insinuate that women themselves can stave off attacks. They insist we can wear modest clothes or be grateful for unconventional looks, or that we can avoid “asking for it” by “presenting all the sensuality and the sexuality,” as Donna Karan has said. With each of these betrayals, the burden we all carry grows heavier.

What this reasoning does not grapple with — and it is a perennial rejoinder to discussions of sexual assault and women’s vulnerability — is that no one escapes unwanted male attention because they don’t meet certain beauty standards or because they don’t dress a certain way. They escape because they are lucky.

Sexual violence is about power. There is a sexual component, yes, but mostly it’s about someone exerting his or her will over another and deriving pleasure and satisfaction from that exertion. We cannot forget this, or the women and men who have been harassed or assaulted but aren’t “conventionally attractive” will be ignored, silenced, or worse, disbelieved.

And then there are the ways that women diminish their experiences as “not that bad.” Because it was just a cat call. It was just a man grabbing me. It was just a man shoving me up against a wall. It was just a man raping me. He didn’t have a weapon. He stopped following me after 10 blocks. He didn’t leave many bruises. He didn’t kill me, therefore it is not that bad. Nothing I deal with in this country compares with what women in other parts of the world deal with. We offer up this refrain over and over because that is what we need to tell ourselves, because if we were to face how bad it really is, we might not be able to shoulder the burden for one moment longer.

In the wake of the Weinstein allegations, a list appeared online, an anonymous accounting of men in media who have committed a range of infractions from sleazy DMs to rape. And just as quickly as the list appeared, it disappeared. I saw the list. A couple of people didn’t belong on it simply because their behaviors weren’t sexual in nature, but some of them were men whose behavior called for a warning and who deserved public shame. Even where I live, outside the media bubble, in a small town in Indiana, I had already heard some of the stories that were shared.

There are a great many open secrets about bad men.

As the list circulated, there was a lot of hand-wringing about libel and the ethics of anonymous disclosure. There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men. There was concern that the “milder” infractions would be conflated with the more serious ones, as if women lack the capacity for critical thinking and discernment about behaviors that are or are not appropriate in professional contexts. More energy was spent worrying about how men were affected than worrying about the pain women have suffered. Women were not trusted to create a tangible artifact of their experiences so that they might have more to rely upon than the whisper networks women have long cultivated to warn one another about the bad men they encounter.

Meanwhile, there was a hashtag, #metoo — a chorus of women and some men sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Me too, me too, me too. I thought about participating but I was just too tired. I have nothing more to say about my history of violence beyond saying I have been hurt, almost too many times to count. I have been hurt enough that some terrible things no longer even register as pain.

We already know victims’ stories. Women testify about their hurt, publicly and privately, all the time. When this happens, men, in particular, act shocked and surprised that sexual violence is so pervasive because they are afforded the luxury of oblivion. And then they start to panic because not all men are predators and they don’t want to be lumped in with the bad men and they make women’s pain all about themselves. They choose not to face that enough men are predators that women engage in all sorts of protective behaviors and strategies so that they might stop adding to their testimony. And then there are the men who act so overwhelmed, who ask, “What can I possibly do?”

The answer is simple.

Men can start putting in some of the work women have long done in offering testimony. They can come forward and say “me too” while sharing how they have hurt women in ways great and small. They can testify about how they have cornered women in narrow office hallways or made lewd comments to co-workers or refused to take no for an answer or worn a woman down by guilting her into sex and on and on and on. It would equally be a balm if men spoke up about the times when they witnessed violence or harassment and looked the other way or laughed it off or secretly thought a woman was asking for it. It’s time for men to start answering for themselves because women cannot possibly solve this problem they had no hand in creating.","Dear Men: It’s You, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/metoo-sexual-harassment-men.html

Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.
“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said.","For immigrants living far from their homelands, music — even a few notes of a favorite ballad — can summon a lifetime of memories. With each song come remembrances of a lost love, a long-lost relative, or a lazy summer day. Music can also connect children born in the United States to the rhythms and cultures left behind by their parents.

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.
It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces.
Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area.","Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html

“My way of working is very practical,” he said. “There are many wonderful solutions to real food, but I focus on what we can scale. The Slow Food guys were right, but what they didn’t know was how to scale. If you can’t scale, it doesn’t matter.”

Unlike some of his colleagues in the tech world, Mr. Musk is driven more by cooking than by the love of a good algorithm. Growing up in Pretoria, South Africa, he started in the kitchen at age 12, making meals as a way to bring his family together. His mother, the model Maye Musk, worked as a dietitian to support the family after she divorced his father, Errol Musk, an engineer and pilot.

At her house, Mr. Musk said, “it was all brown bread and plain yogurt.” At his dad’s, he and his brother and sister, Tosca (now a film producer and director), ate whatever the maid cooked, usually in front of the TV. “It wasn’t very good,” he recalled.

“I noticed that when I cooked, my dad especially would make us all sit down and eat together,” he said. “I loved it.”

He graduated from college in Canada and made his first fortune in 1999, when he and his brother sold Zip2 — a digital mapping service that helped newspapers including The New York Times produce online city guides — to Compaq Computer for $307 million. He became an investor in his brother’s other ventures, including PayPal and Tesla. (He is on the board of both Elon Musk’s electric car company and his rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Chipotle Mexican Grill.)

Set financially, Mr. Musk moved from Silicon Valley to New York and enrolled in the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center). He lived near the World Trade Center, and after the 9/11 attacks, spent six weeks volunteering as a cook for firefighters and other people working the pile. He finally understood, he said, the link between food and community.

Soon after, he and Jen Lewin, his first wife, left for Colorado, where he met Mr. Matheson and opened The Kitchen in 2004. With its deep farm-to-table ethos and casually elegant style, the restaurant was an immediate hit.

Both projects were running just fine without him, so Mr. Musk became chief executive of another tech company. Then, on a 2010 trip with his family in Jackson Hole, Wyo., he was sliding down a snowy hill on an inner tube when it flipped. He broke his neck and was temporarily paralyzed.

During the two months he had to lie flat on his back, it became clear that he wanted to devote himself to food. He and his wife divorced; he quit the tech company and dedicated himself to changing the way Americans eat.

Mr. Musk became interested in school gardens. He remains friendly with his ex-wife (the couple have two boys, and he has a daughter with another woman), and Ms. Lewin designed modular curved plastic planters that could be arranged in any schoolyard. Paired with instructions on how they can be used to teach subjects like science, the first gardens were installed in Denver schools in 2011.

Mr. Musk has begun a chain of hyper-local restaurants called Next Door, which he and Mr. Matheson envision as the Applebee’s for a new generation.

All the food is cooked from scratch. Menus feature wild salmon, burgers of local pasture-raised beef and big Greek salads with vegetables from nearby farms. Entree prices average $14, and the restaurants are designed so customers sit down together to eat and get their meals almost as soon as they order.

The first opened six years ago next to The Kitchen in Boulder. In September, another opened in a huge urban renewal project in Memphis called Crosstown Concourse, an abandoned Sears distribution center that has been turned into apartments and shops, with a school, a health clinic and an arts center. The partners plan to add 50 more Next Door restaurants by the end of 2020.

Mr. Musk also opened an outpost of his more upscale Kitchen restaurant inside a 4,500-acre urban park called Shelby Farms in the center of Memphis. But he insisted that he be allowed to buy 300 acres nearby that for decades had been used to grow cotton, so he could turn it into an organic farm, a project now in the works.

He is also testing the Kitchenette, a little takeout spot in Shelby Farms that sells locally grown, well-prepared meals for about $5 — his answer to a fast-food restaurant.

Mr. Musk’s nonprofit arm, The Kitchen Community, has put learning gardens into 100 Memphis schools, providing both staff and materials. Each one costs about $40,000, money that comes from the Musk Foundation and local donors. He has placed his gardens in schools in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and 150 in Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel gave the project $2 million in city funds. By 2020, Mr. Musk hopes to have them in more than 1,000 schools.

He is not a fan of traditional school garden programs. “They don’t scale at all,” he said.

There are other ways to ruffle the feathers of Alice Waters, the Bay Area chef who helped pioneer the American slow-food movement and the concept of the edible schoolyard, but criticizing her approach to local food and school gardens is near the top of the list.

“I don’t want to hear another word about scaling,” Ms. Waters said. “He doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. He’s very earnest about what he’s doing, but he doesn’t know enough about farming and about the soil. He wants to do the right thing, but he just hasn’t done his homework. Not everything has to be scalable.”

Mr. Musk says he is “absolutely in conflict” with Ms. Waters. “I love her, but I don’t agree with her views.”

Critics have taken on his Square Roots project, too. The idea is to train young farmers by teaching them to grow greens with nothing but enhanced water and LEDs in shipping containers, and then sell the lettuce and kale to local restaurants and office workers.

Last year the project installed 10 containers in the parking lot of the old Pfizer factory in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, each able to grow as much produce as two acres of dirt. In August, Square Roots secured $5.4 million in private seed funding, and has grants from the United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Musk wants one in every major city.

Whether food actually needs soil is one of the flash points between organic traditionalists and people like Mr. Musk. “Ideologically, they prefer soil,” he said. “We don’t care. Let them fight their fight.”

Mr. Musk’s ascent has underscored a generational rift that pits old-liners who shun aspects of emerging food science against a new wave of food disrupters who haven’t embraced the roles that history, flavor and pleasure play, said Garrett Broad, an assistant professor at Fordham University who recently wrote about one aspect of the divide for the publication Civil Eats.

“Somebody like Kimbal Musk could be an important bridge to bring some of these ideas together,” Dr. Broad said.

Maybe, Mr. Musk says. He is as much a believer in the power of technology as anyone in Silicon Valley. But he is a cook at heart.

A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy.
On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend.
It’s not good.”If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career.
“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Late Wednesday, Nxivm released a statement through an affiliate, stating that an unnamed media outlet had “unfoundedly, and incorrectly, linked NXIVM corporation, and its related companies, with a social group.”

The statement asserted that the article “might be a criminal product of criminal minds,” and said NXIVM “will explore any and all legal remedies.”

“NXIVM was not able to participate in this story because it painfully held true to the due process of our free world justice system,” the statement said.

During a three-month period, officials of Nxivm did not respond to repeated requests by The Times for interviews and responses. Neither Dr. Porter nor Dr. Roberts responded to repeated inquiries.

Mr. Azzopardi said in his statement: “The allegations in this article are disturbing. Counsel’s Office will be reviewing this matter to determine if applicable laws, regulations and procedures were followed by the agencies cited in this report and that review will determine if further action is warranted.”

In a letter, the State Department of Health declined to take action on a complaint filed in July against Dr. Roberts because she had not been acting as a doctor treating a patient when she reportedly performed branding.

In a separate complaint filed in August, a former member of Nxivm, Jennifer Kobelt, 28, described Dr. Porter as the physician who treated Mr. Raniere’s followers when they got ill and the “main scientist” who conducted tests involving the group.

Last year, Ms. Kobelt said, Dr. Porter drove her to a former restaurant called Apropos in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town not far from Albany that is now used by Nxivm as a meeting center.

There, he showed her a series of video clips, three of which were so violent that the images “have haunted me for almost a year now,” she stated in her complaint.

In of one them, Mexican cartel members are seen killing four women. “Please look into this ASAP,” Ms. Kobelt wrote. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, medical regulators informed her that they were declining to act on her complaint because Dr. Porter’s supposed actions did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

Words and images work together in a pair of large murals by Matt Huynh, commissioned for the occasion and labeled “Home Front” and “War Front.” Installed in the galleries, and available as brochure handouts (a keeper of a historical cheat sheet), they detail, in more or less chronological order, the war’s primary issues and events as played out in two crucial years, 1966 and 1967.

The “Home Front” gives paragraph-long descriptions of domestic developments, from epical public protests for and against the “Living Room War” — so called because of its ubiquitous presence on network television — to the almost furtive return of traumatized veterans.

When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

For the honey badger, it’s whatever works: anti-Semite one day; Israel’s make-believe champion the next. Bannon is the most revolting operator in American political life since Roy Cohn. He is also the most consequential one.

In his speech, Bannon asked of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: “Who’s going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar”? Caesar was stabbed 23 times on the floor of the Roman Senate on the 15th of March, 44 B.C. John Wilkes Booth also invoked Brutus from the stage of Ford’s Theatre after he had assassinated Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party. This is what now passes for acceptable speech among the G.O.P.’s “values voters.”

Bannon thinks he can get away with this because he already has. He did so to spectacular effect last year with Donald Trump, and again last month in Alabama with Judge Roy Moore. He will run this play as often as he can, whether his candidates win or lose. The goal isn’t to win elections but to purge the party and remake it in Bannon’s image. He wasn’t kidding when he told historian Ronald Radosh in 2013 that he’s a “Leninist.”

It also helps Bannon that the Roll-Over Republicans who might oppose him lack the political courage to do so. Winston Churchill said of the neutral countries in World War II, “each one hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last.” Think of Paul Ryan as the moral equivalent of Norway.

What might stop Bannon? Nobody should expect G.O.P. invertebrates to ever gain a spine. But Judge Moore is in a dead heat with Doug Jones, his Democratic opponent, in what should be the easiest Republican cakewalk of the season. Even the stupid party might remember its Senate nominations of Delaware’s Christine “I’m not a witch” O’Donnell and Missouri’s Todd “legitimate rape” Akin.

But parties need more than just the spur of defeat to give voters a sense of moral belonging and political purpose, and in his speech Monday McCain did that:

“We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. We are the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad. We have done great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we have become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did. We have a moral obligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than shame on ourselves if we don’t. We will not thrive in a world where our leadership and ideals are absent. We wouldn’t deserve to.”

This is the finest expression of the American cause uttered by any major political figure in a generation. It could yet serve as a rallying point for a Republican Party that can save itself from dishonor, win its share of elections, and stand up to the honey badgers who mean to pillage it.",McCain the Hedgehog vs. Bannon the Honey Badger,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/mccain-bannon-republican.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

At three minutes and change, the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho” is one of the most familiar in film history. The deadly encounter between Marion Crane and the cross-dressing Norman Bates was shot over seven days in 1959, and every element is instantly recognizable: the shadowy figure tearing aside the shower curtain, the stream of blood and water circling the drain, Bernard Herrmann’s shrieking violins. The scene has been dissected by scholars and critics and parodied by everyone from Mel Brooks to “The Simpsons”; its score has become aural shorthand for “something really scary is about to happen.” Is there anything a “Psycho” fan still might not know about this most famous of cinematic moments?

Turns out, plenty. In his new documentary “78/52,” the director Alexandre O. Philippe examines the sequence in myriad ways, looking at, for example, audience reaction in 1960 (sustained, unremitting screams) and the film’s visual obsession with shower heads. In addition to talking with directors, historians and others, Mr. Philippe pored over the original storyboards and Hitchcock’s handwritten notes. Mr. Philippe estimated that he’s seen the iconic scene thousands of times.

Still, the documentary maker continues to be fascinated by it. Since completing the film, he’s talked with the choreographer Sean Curran about the movement of bodies within the sequence, and hopes to look at the Bauhausian use of triangles, squares and circles. “There’s so much I’m still discovering. That’s why people keep going back to it, because it goes so deep,” he said, adding, “There’s only a handful of movies that do that.”

Think you know “Psycho”? Here are five things that might surprise you:

The murder in the book is much different from the movie

The story was adapted from a 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. But the killing is a lot shorter in the original telling. Mr. Hitchcock took 78 shots and 52 cuts (hence the documentary’s title) to capture Marion’s murder. Bloch took only two and a half sentences to describe the killing, which ends with Norman lopping off Marion’s head. Bloch also reveals Norman’s heavily rouged mug (which the movie keeps in shadow). “In the book, the murder itself is an afterthought,” Mr. Philippe said. “With Hitchcock, it was all about the murder.”

Hitch had a fine ear for melons

To find just the right sound of someone being stabbed, Hitchcock famously listened as his prop man hacked away at a variety of melons. Which one sounded most like a knife cutting through flesh? Hitch’s one-word determination: casaba. Six decades later, Mr. Philippe replicated the experiment, hunting down 27 varieties of melons from across Latin America, Asia, and Europe, and chopping into them. He then sent the sound files to Gary Rydstrom and Shannon Mills, award-winning sound designers at Skywalker Sound, and asked them to listen. Their expert conclusion: casaba. “It has a very thick skin, and it’s very starchy and gooey in the center,” Mr. Philippe said.

Photo

Norman’s parlor wasn’t just filled with stuffed bird carcasses

There were also paintings — including a reproduction of “Susanna and the Elders,” by the 17th-century artist Frans van Mieris the Elder. In a promo for the movie, Hitchcock nods at the painting’s “great significance” before quickly scuttling away. A popular subject of painters like Rubens and Rembrandt, the biblical tale tells of two old men who leer at a woman as she bathes, then threaten to blackmail her unless she has sex with both of them. In the film, Norman uses “Susanna” to cover the peephole through which he spies on Marion, the painting’s depiction of voyeurism (and more) mirroring Norman’s own lecherousness. “The version that Hitchcock selected is the most graphic version you can find,” Mr. Philippe said. “They’re not just looking at her or watching her, they’re groping her, and it conveys this idea of the violation of a woman being watched.”

It inspired another great movie moment

Martin Scorsese used the shower scene as a model for the bout between Jake LaMotta and Sugar Ray Robinson in “Raging Bull,” from the sprays of sweat flying across the canvas to the streams of blood shooting out of every inch of LaMotta’s battered skull. When Robinson raises his right arm high above his head before smashing in LaMotta’s face, it’s lousy form for a boxer, but perfect for a knife-wielding murderer, which is what Mr. Scorsese was going for. Watch the two scenes side by side, and the similarities are remarkable, Mr. Philippe said, adding, “The moment you know that it was inspired by the shower scene, you can never look at it the same way. When you watch it, you can almost hear the strings.”

Anthony Perkins wasn’t the killer

Spoiler alert: Norman’s mom didn’t kill Marion Crane. But it wasn’t Norman either, or at least not Anthony Perkins as Norman. The mystery stabber was a body double, Margo Epper. Mr. Perkins was in New York rehearsing for a Broadway show, so Ms. Epper donned Norman’s unbecoming dress and wig for the climactic scene. During filming, however, her features were visible in the shot, so layers of makeup were applied to darken her face. Audiences didn’t notice that the killer’s face was completely in shadow in a shower flooded with light. “You’re too busy focusing on what’s happening,” Mr. Philippe said. “It’s an obvious trick, but you’re so focused on this shocking scene, the last thing you’re going to notice is the trick. That’s Hitchcock as Houdini. He’s doing his magic right in front of your eyes, but you can’t see it.”",5 ‘Psycho’ Surprises: Inside the Most Familiar Scene in Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/movies/psycho-shower-scene-hitchcock-surprises.html

SAN FRANCISCO — In an escalation of its ride-hailing war against Uber, Lyft has begun to explore going public in 2018 and is trying to strengthen its position by raising more capital, including $1 billion in new financing led by an investment arm of Google’s parent company.

Lyft has had talks with investment banks about an initial public offering next year, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the conversations are confidential. Lyft has not decided which bank may become its lead underwriter for an I.P.O., the people said.

To bolster itself ahead of any public offering, Lyft on Thursday said it had raised $1 billion in financing led by CapitalG, a venture investment arm of Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet. The funding values Lyft at $10 billion before the introduction of new capital — a significant jump from the company’s last valuation of $6.9 billion.

The new investment further complicates the convoluted web of financial relationships in the ride-hailing industry, where companies like Lyft and Uber have hauled in enormous amounts of funding from firms that often put money into competing companies.

Rich Lowry in National Review:

“It might be the stupidest and most unworthy controversy of the year, and that’s saying something.”

According to Mr. Lowry, the uproar on both sides of the aisle over this issue is misguided. Mr. Trump may have been right that President Obama didn’t call each family of a fallen soldier, but he was nonetheless wrong to “use that point as a bludgeon.” Mr. Lowry adds that while the president’s reported comments to the family of Sergeant. Johnson sounded “horrible in isolation,” there’s no way to properly judge without hearing the entire phone call in context. Moreover, Mr. Lowry believes that controversies over condolence calls should be entirely left “out of our poisonous political debate.” Read more »

From the Left

Brandon Friedman in The New York Daily News:



“There’s often a misconception among non-veterans that service members sign up with the expectation that they may die. But I can tell you: I did two tours in combat as an infantry officer and I never met a soldier who thought dying was a reasonable result of his or her service.”

If the president did indeed tell Sergeant Johnson’s widow that her husband “knew what he was signing up for” in his call, then, according to Mr. Friedman, he has a poor grasp on how the military actually works. Mr. Friedman, who served two tours of duty and worked in the Obama administration, explains that since the Sept. 11 attacks one out of every 5,000 service members serving in Iraq or Afghanistan died on duty. “This makes it clear that dying in combat is neither common nor expected,” he argues. What “keeps troops going,” he explains, is the faith that your government, and your commander in chief, believe that soldiers’ lives are valuable. “No one shrugs death off as an inevitability.” Read more »

Ameer Hasan Loggins in The Guardian:

“I fully empathize with the family of Sergeant La David Johnson. [...] Sadly, the lack of respect given to them is not an American aberration. It is a part of this country’s ugly history regarding black people and the military.”

When Mr. Loggins heard reports of what Mr. Trump had said to Sergeant Johnson’s family, he recognized it as the latest in a long string of moments black veterans were shown disrespect. Mr. Loggins points out that black troops have disproportionally experienced military punishment — up to, and including, the death penalty. Read more »

Margaret Hartmann in New York Magazine:

“The ongoing dispute over Trump’s treatment of Gold Star families runs the risk of overshadowing a more significant concern: More than two weeks after the attack, we don’t really know what happened in Niger.”

Ms. Hartmann notes that in all the attention paid to the condolence call controversy, most outlets and readers have missed a much more important story: the uncertain events from an attack in Niger that left four soldiers — including Sergeant Johnson — dead. In this piece, she outlines what is known and what questions still remain. Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Leonid Bershidsky in Bloomberg:

“The U.S. demands even more ceremony of its presidents than other countries in part because of the expectation that the head of state is also the moral-authority-in-chief where Christian leadership is prized and the president is expected to channel those attitudes.”

Mr. Bershidsky takes a broader view in his column by examining the symbolic, or ceremonial, function of a U.S. president and how President Trump may or may not fulfill this role. He explains how in other countries, ceremonial duties such as honoring soldiers who have died falls to a monarch or other governmental figurehead. In the U.S., he notes, policy and ceremony fall to the same person, for better or for worse. Read more »

Phillip Price and Whiterose, locked in a deepening clash of egos and global power-politics, threaten each other’s plans for world domination.

And in the darkest scene of perhaps the entire series, Joanna Wellick’s disposable hunk Derek took his final manipulation and betrayal badly, shooting her through the forehead and splattering her infant son with blood.

The individual miseries and miscalculations reflect a broader theme of Season 3 so far: As the aftershocks of the 5/9 hack ripple ever outward, the players hoping to shape or capitalize on the chaos are finding it harder to manage than they anticipated.

This includes Elliot, who now is trying to reverse the entire thing. Appalled at what resulted from his world-shattering masterstroke, he has joined the enemy, E Corp, as a security analyst and aims to undo the hack. But first, he aims to counteract Mr. Robot and Wellick’s murderous Stage 2 plans, by convincing E Corp executives to change how the company digitizes its records — tough luck, aboynamedg00 — and buying time by manipulating shipping manifests and Coenesque delivery drivers. (You know Earl, he does what the paper says.)

Sam Esmail and company have become some of TV’s best montage artists over two-plus seasons, and Wednesday’s edition was among the show’s most electrifying. Set to INXS’s irresistibly propulsive “New Sensation,” the sequence so effectively conveyed the energizing effect of Elliot’s new sense of purpose that I almost missed how bogus much of it was.

Which was the point: The empty optimism Elliot spouted as he plowed through Zoloft and Trunk Club officewear was transparent corporate drone denial, conveying the extent to which he’s still trying to sort himself out. “It doesn’t mean I’m selling out; I’m growing up,” he chirped at one point, before coming back with an even bigger whopper: “Changing the world was never about tearing E Corp down; it was about making them better!” (As for how a convicted hacker could get a cybersecurity job, well it’s happened before, but I guess in this case we’re supposed to believe Angela has pull and Price doesn’t mind having Elliot where he can keep an eye on him? Or something? I suppose some explanation or revelatory twist could come later.)



But back at home, Elliot’s weeping over “Dancing With the Stars,” gutted by the “empty void” he feels inside where Mr. Robot used to be (he thinks) and his own disconnection from being part of “something important.”

It’s better for everyone that he’s not here, Elliot tells his therapist, which was an even more unconscious form of denial, because Mr. Robot is not only there, he’s feeling cornered. He’s more caustic and menacing as he and Elliot become, paradoxically, both more fluidly interchangeable, moment to moment, and more detached as they work against one another.

Clearly this center cannot hold — Elliot’s struggle to put himself back together parallels his efforts to do the same with the post-5/9 world. (Quite the to-do list.) But while I’m enjoying the mechanics of portraying this conflict — particularly Rami Malek’s brief Christian Slater impression during the hypnosis scene — it’s another character that’s carrying most of the emotional weight so far this season.

That would be Darlene, who is barely hanging on in an impossible position: Coerced by the F.B.I. into betraying her brother as his alter ego threatens her, all of it coming as she endures the trauma of seeing her boyfriend get assassinated not long ago. (And also of her murder of Susan Jacobs not long before that.)

Darlene spent much of Season 1 as a one-note agitator before deepening last year, as events and her movement spun out of control. This season she has emerged as the lone relatable human perspective connecting the various strands of the show’s dense plot, a more sympathetic counterpoint to Elliot’s magnetic but distancing (and unreliable) one.

Carly Chaiken’s large, expressive eyes (it’s kind of this show’s thing) most commonly flashed with contempt in the first two seasons, but here they telegraph her wounded state, as well as the mix of concern and resentment that fuels her interactions with her brilliant but complicated brother.

“Don’t think for a second that our [bad] childhood was only yours,” she told him at their usual Coney Island spot. This story’s not only Elliot’s either, and he’s not the only one who would like to hit undo. But the difference is Darlene has no illusions about how little control he has, and she’s seen that sometimes broken things stay that way.

A Few Thoughts While We Fire Up the Bone Saw

• The slow pan across Baby Wellick’s blood-spattered little face was one of the most disturbing things I’ve seen on TV in a while. The goriness of Joanna’s exit, which also included a close-up of her head being cut open in an autopsy and the upsetting news that her son will be handed over to social services, felt like a gruesome retort to those who have loudly complained about the character online. Happy now, haters?

• Within the story, of course, Joanna’s murder would seem destined to turn Tyrell Wellick into an even looser cannon.

• A little meta goes a long way, but so far this season “Mr. Robot” is staying on the right side of the line. In the premiere we saw it poking fun at its own dramatization of angst and revolution with posters for “Shift + Control,” coming this fall to NBC. This week we heard Elliot wondering if his deep contempt for E Corp was a result of his “my dorm room philosophizing run amok,” which might strike some viewers as a succinct critique of this paranoid series.","‘Mr. Robot’ Season 3, Episode 2: Elliot Hits Undo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/arts/television/mr-robot-season-3-episode-2-recap.html

A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.","“They have to realize the world has changed,” Ms. Klobuchar said.

Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid television, radio and print political advertising has been subject for years. The Federal Election Commission justified the so-called internet exemption rule by declaring the internet “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.”

That attitude has many fewer adherents after the revelations that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, Facebook sold more than $100,000 worth of ads to a Russian company linked to the Kremlin, while Google sold at least $4,700 worth of ads to accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government.

Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.

“It’s ridiculous,” said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. “We need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew — and we all knew — that this was possible.”

The new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.

The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 “are a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,” Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.

The regulatory pressure comes at a particularly trying time for Google, Facebook and other tech giants. The companies, once celebrated as benevolent drivers of innovation and economic growth, are facing mounting criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for complex tax avoidance efforts, the hosting of pages used in sex trafficking, lax privacy protections and increasing monopoly power.

In response, they have ramped up lobbying and public relations campaigns, with Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, last week whirring through Washington on an apology tour and charm offensive.

Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.

After initially resisting requests to turn over Russian-linked ads, Facebook has provided them to a congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But Google has yet to do so, and neither company has made the ads public.

And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.

When the Federal Election Commission moved to strengthen its online disclaimer requirements in 2011 and again last year, the companies either ignored requests for input or suggested that new rules could “stand in the way of innovation,” as Facebook asserted in a 2011 comment to the commission.

Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity — that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie’s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.

While the election commission approved Google’s request, which was submitted in 2010, by a 4-to-2 vote, it deadlocked 3 to 3 on Facebook’s request, which was submitted the next year. Facebook nonetheless proceeded as if it was exempt from the disclaimer requirement, declining to mandate that political advertisements on its platform list their sponsors.

Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It was “kind of like the chickens coming home to roost,” said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.

She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that “the savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.” because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.

Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.

“Russia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,” he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because — according to Facebook — they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”

Citing United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, “The Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Critics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, “but they were silent,” said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.

“And they are still trying to avoid regulation,” Mr. Noble said.

A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.

And the company’s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, “We look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution” to “achieve transparency in political advertising.”

She pointed out that the company had enacted new policies to self-police its ads, which Facebook asserted in a company blog post “would have caught these malicious actors faster and prevented more improper ads from running” in 2016.

Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said that strict ads policies, including limits on political-ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion, already exist at Google. But the company is “taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.”",Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/facebook-google-russia-meddling-disclosure.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Had its aluminum fallen short of those requirements, it would have resulted in large and expensive recalls and, perhaps, legal battles involving Kobe Steel, carmakers and car owners. While any of those things might still happen, the findings could offer Kobe Steel some respite for now.

Two railways that operate Shinkansen “bullet trains” in Japan that contain metal produced by Kobe Steel have already said their trains are safe. The railways — Central Japan Railway and West Japan Railway — said last week that although the components they got from the steel maker fell short of the design standards they had requested, they nonetheless met specifications required for safety and did not pose an accident risk.

Another Japanese automaker, Mitsubishi Motors, vouched for the safety of Kobe Steel aluminum on Wednesday.

Kobe Steel customers worldwide have been forced to scramble to review their supply chains since the company’s revelations. The customers include American carmakers and Boeing, which obtains Kobe Steel materials through subcontractors in Japan. About 500 customers have been affected worldwide, Kobe Steel has said. The European Aviation Safety Agency recommended this week that companies suspend the use of Kobe Steel products when possible pending results of the reviews.

Last week Kobe Steel promised to complete in two weeks its own investigation into potential safety hazards related to the data falsification and to deliver in a month the results of a broader examination of the company’s failings.

Kobe Steel said on Oct. 8 that employees at factories in Japan had altered inspection certificates on some aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to this past August and that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years.

That has completely changed. Today, 75 percent of people with opioid addictions began with prescription painkillers. The slide starts not on a street corner, but in a doctor’s office.

That’s because pharmaceutical companies in the 1990s sought to promote opioid painkillers as new blockbuster drugs. Company executives accused doctors of often undertreating pain (there was something to this, but pharma executives contrived to turn it into a crisis that they could monetize). The companies backed front organizations like the American Pain Foundation, which purported to speak on behalf of suffering patients.

These front organizations, as well as professionals sometimes funded by the pharmaceutical industry, heralded pain as the “fifth vital sign,” along with pulse, temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure. The opioid promoters hailed opioids as “safe and effective,” and they particularly encouraged opioids for returning veterans — one reason so many veterans have suffered addictions.

Pharma companies spent heavily advertising opioids — $14 million in medical journals in 2011 alone, almost triple what they had spent in 2001 and pitched them for a wide range of chronic pains, such as arthritis and back pain.

Companies even argued that signs of addiction were a reason to prescribe more opioids. Endo Pharmaceuticals distributed a book suggesting that when a patient showed strange behavior, “the clinician’s first response” should be to increase the dose of opioids.

Several of these examples come from a lawsuit by Ohio against major pharmaceutical companies, including Purdue, Teva, Cephalon, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen. A company affiliated with Purdue pleaded guilty of felony fraud in connection with its marketing of OxyContin, but none of its executives went to prison.

Drug companies employed roughly the same strategy as street-corner pushers: Get somebody hooked and business will take care of itself. So last year, Americans received 236 million opioid prescriptions — that’s about one bottle for every adult.

A Senate investigation found that one company, Insys Therapeutics, successfully redirected a powerful opioid called Subsys, meant for cancer pain, to patients without cancer. Sarah Fuller, a woman with neck and back pain, was prescribed Subsys by her doctor, who received payments from Insys.

Fuller died of an overdose of Subsys.

Meanwhile, Insys had the best-performing initial public offering in 2013, and revenue tripled in the next two years, the Senate report said. Likewise, the Sackler family, owner of the company that makes OxyContin, joined Forbes’s list of richest American families in 2015, with $14 billion.

It’s maddening that the public narrative is still often about an opioid crisis fueled by the personal weakness and irresponsibility of users. No, it’s fueled primarily by the greed and irresponsibility of drug lords — including the kind who inhabit executive suites. The Washington Post quoted a former D.E.A. official as referring to pharmaceutical company representatives as “drug dealers in lab coats.”

I was invited the other day to a gala honoring the C.E.O. of one of these pharma companies for his moral leadership. I wanted to throw up. Since 2000, more than 200,000 Americans have died from overdoses of prescription opioids — the consequence of a deliberate strategy to make money by ignoring public welfare.

Our pattern of opioid addiction points to a tragedy, driven by the greed of some of America’s leading companies and business executives, systematically manipulating doctors and patients and killing people on a scale that terrorists could never dream of.

Using constitutional powers, Mr. Rajoy could appoint a caretaker administration in Catalonia.
Mr. Puigdemont, on the other hand, could face sedition charges and ultimately a long prison sentence for presenting a unilateral declaration of independence that violates Spain’s Constitution.
In his letter on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont mentioned the arrest of the two leaders as evidence of Spain’s repressive stance.","“A bad situation has become even worse today,” said Argelia Queralt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Barcelona. “Neither side seems really willing to yield an inch, which means there is only a very limited chance of any positive outcome to this conflict.”

The Catalan government has said that 90 percent of those who voted in the referendum supported independence. But Mr. Rajoy’s government and the courts had declared the vote illegal, and the police officers sent to block polling places wounded hundreds in clashes.

Only about 40 percent of the Catalan electorate took part, after Madrid advised those who opposed secession to stay away from polling stations.

The latest statements from each side now move the dispute to the brink of a potentially explosive confrontation.

Íñigo Méndez de Vigo, spokesman for the Spanish government, said at a news conference that Madrid was ready to use “all the means within its reach to restore the legality and constitutional order as soon as possible.”

Yet such steps are fraught with uncertainty in a country that adopted its democratic constitution only in 1978, after the death of its longtime dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco.

Last week, Mr. Rajoy initiated a request to invoke a broad and forceful tool that has never before been used — Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution — which would allow him to take direct control of Catalonia.

He said he could resort to such a step if Mr. Puigdemont did not clearly back down from a threat to declare independence.

But on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont sent a defiant letter to Mr. Rajoy, blaming him for escalating the conflict by refusing to meet and negotiate.

“If the government continues to prevent dialogue and maintains the repression,’’ he wrote, “the Parliament of Catalonia could go ahead, if it deems it opportune, and vote the formal declaration of independence.”

Officials in Madrid have repeatedly warned in recent days that Mr. Rajoy would consider anything short of a clear withdrawal of the declaration of independence to be unacceptable, after what he deemed an unsatisfactory response from Mr. Puigdemont on Monday.

Article 155 would give Madrid the authority to suspend Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan lawmakers, and to take charge of the region’s autonomous administration, including the Catalan broadcaster and autonomous police force, although Mr. Rajoy has not publicly committed to an emergency intervention.

It is unclear what Mr. Rajoy will propose to his cabinet on Saturday, but he may try to gradually raise pressure on the fragile coalition of Catalan separatists rather than risk a forceful intervention that could further galvanize the independence movement.

José Luis Ábalos, an official from the main opposition Socialist party, indicated at a news conference on Thursday that the party would support Mr. Rajoy — as long as the prime minister made limited and short use of Article 155, and also somehow kept “self-government” in Catalonia.

Using constitutional powers, Mr. Rajoy could appoint a caretaker administration in Catalonia. Mr. Puigdemont, on the other hand, could face sedition charges and ultimately a long prison sentence for presenting a unilateral declaration of independence that violates Spain’s Constitution.

Politicians in Madrid have recently demanded that Catalonia hold regional elections as soon as possible, but Mr. Puigdemont made no mention of such a vote in his letter on Thursday.

The separatist leaders of Catalonia are already claiming that Madrid has used disproportionate means to push them out of office, with the help of the Spanish police and the courts.

About 200,000 demonstrators gathered on Tuesday in central Barcelona, according to the local police, to demand the release of two separatist leaders who were sent to prison without bail, pending a trial on sedition charges. In his letter on Thursday, Mr. Puigdemont mentioned the arrest of the two leaders as evidence of Spain’s repressive stance.

Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, is an important engine of the Spanish economy. Independence aspirations have built in recent years over a host of social and economic grievances.

Those tensions grew as Mr. Rajoy and Catalan leaders talked past one another, turning the kind of dispute that might have been defused years ago into a full-blown constitutional crisis.

The rising uncertainty and the threat of declaring independence have already prompted hundreds of companies to relocate their headquarters outside Catalonia, further straining the unwieldy separatist coalition that holds a majority of the seats in the regional Parliament.

Hard-line secessionists want an abrupt and unilateral rupture with the central government in Madrid, while conservative and more moderate separatists are increasingly worried about the economic consequences for Catalonia.

Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, told Parliament on Thursday that the relocation of Catalan companies was “only an appetizer of what could happen if independence was confirmed — something that the government will not allow.”

Mr. Puigdemont sent his latest letter after an emergency meeting of his conservative party late Wednesday, during which lawmakers gave clear support for not withdrawing the declaration of independence, according to local news reports.

Still, secessionism has divided Catalonia. Separatist parties won control of the regional Parliament in 2015, but with only 48 percent of the vote.

Núria Marín, the Socialist mayor of L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, the second-largest city in Catalonia, just southwest of Barcelona, said on Thursday that politicians on both sides should take the blame for plunging Catalonia into a crisis.

“I believe that with threats on the part of one side or the other, we won’t now solve this situation,” she said. “We are sadly seeing that companies are leaving while we are sending letters to one another.”

Whatever the government decides on Saturday, the Catalan crisis is set to drag on: Mr. Rajoy would need approval from the Senate before intervening in Catalonia.

Mr. Rajoy’s governing Popular Party has a majority in the Senate, and Podemos, a far-left party, is the only major opposition group that is opposed to using Article 155 in Catalonia. Instead, Podemos has suggested that Spain should hold a nationwide referendum over Catalonia’s future statehood.

Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, said Thursday morning that “Spain can’t appear to be like a banana republic that has problems of democracy.” He added, “We don’t want to threaten or repress Catalonia, but we want to convince Catalonia that Spain is a collective project that is worth it.”",Spain Sets Stage to Take Control of Catalonia in Independence Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/world/europe/catalonia-independence-referendum.html

I smiled again and said that I wouldn’t. He gave up and called me stubborn. I said, “I know.” And the meal proceeded without much further ado. In this second encounter with Harvey, I found him to be pushy and idiosyncratic more than anything.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

The Weinstein Investigation

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

Sometimes we practice with new cameras around the office or at home before using them on a story. Other times we send them out on a reporting trip for a trial by fire.

The first time we used the V.R. camera Z Cam S1, we took it to the hottest place on Earth: Danakil, Ethiopia, where temperatures can reach 125 degrees Fahrenheit. In the early days of our V.R. production, we’d had a lot of problems with cameras overheating and turning off. So we weren’t sure how the Z Cam would perform in such a difficult environment. To our delight, it never overheated as it captured stunning images for the resulting film, “The Land of Salt and Fire.”

What have been the strengths of using virtual reality for journalism? What unexpected stumbling blocks have you come across with it?

V.R. is great for creating a sense of place. We often use it for stories in which the place is important to the story and being there can create a visceral experience that is rare in other mediums. V.R. can transport our audience to places they otherwise couldn’t or wouldn’t go, as in “The Antarctica Series,” which takes people below and above the ice of Antarctica.

Unexpected stumbling blocks arise frequently because we’re working on the edges of what we know how to do. There’s often a gap between how we want to tell a story and the tools that we have to do it. That’s when we hack available hardware or software to suit our needs.

I don’t know who will make it, but the first immersive media wearable to be widely adopted will look and function more like a pair of reading glasses than like the V.R. headsets we have today. The first generation of modern V.R. and augmented reality headsets are too clunky to go mainstream. They’re heavy and awkward, sometimes connected to a computer by a cable. They’re good prototypes for getting us started in immersive platforms, but I hope someone builds something that’s more convenient for everyday use.

When that’s possible, I think, glasses will eventually replace smartphones.

How are you thinking about augmented reality and its application toward journalism?

A.R. has huge potential for journalism. There are already a few applications that we’ve seen that could be useful in our reporting.

One is creating three-dimensional objects and putting them in the user’s environment. For example, if we build a 3-D model of how gravitational waves are generated from colliding black holes, you could walk around it to observe the mechanics of an invisible astronomical event.

Location-based A.R. has widespread applications for news, travel, culture and real estate. When visiting the vineyards of Sonoma County, you could access tips and highlights from our Travel section.

I’m also very interested in A.R. portals. Imagine a digital “door” in your living room that leads to a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh.

Of course, I’m most excited about the A.R. applications we haven’t thought of yet.

I often joke that Spotify knows me better than anyone in my life. My favorite feature is Spotify’s Discover Weekly, which serves me a personalized playlist of music I’ve never heard. I save the songs I like, and occasionally make my own playlists out of the ones I love. As with any machine learning algorithm, the more you use it, the smarter it gets. At this point, Spotify is really good (probably better than me) at something I don’t have time for anymore — finding new music I like.

See the other six coversALONG WITH COLOR, Van Noten also has an unrivaled sense of pattern.
Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows.
To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?","But if the gardens are, at least to some extent, the source of some of Van Noten’s inspiration, they are also a metaphor for the daily difficulties of running an independent fashion label with the degree of autonomy and oversight that Van Noten has. As we walk through an allée of topiaried cypress, Van Noten says that he and his longtime partner in both business and life, Patrick Vangheluwe, often joke that they’ll someday write a book titled “The Depressed Gardener,” about all the things that can go wrong in a garden, no matter the allowances made for changing climates, unpredictable weather, rapacious insects and on and on. You plan and plan, he says, and something always goes awry anyway. The depressed gardener knows that. He also knows, however, that it is simply what happens when you try to control what cannot be controlled — to be a depressed gardener is to live in a state of constant humility. But it also means a heightened ability to appreciate the strange gifts that circumstance sometimes affords. It means living a life of unknowns, large and small, and yet never ceasing in one’s attempts to coax beauty from even the most forbidding, the meanest of places: the spots of earth that everyone else has overlooked.

TRYING TO EXPLAIN the fever that Van Noten’s clothes induce to someone who’s never seen them is an unsatisfying task, because they in many ways defy what we’ve been taught to admire in contemporary fashion. You don’t, for example, buy a Dries Van Noten dress or shirt or skirt simply for its cut: The shapes, some of which appear season after season, are conventionally feminine and invariably flattering, smartly crafted and architecturally sound. A Dries Van Noten midi-length dress will always be draped in just the right way, so that it allows the illusion of a waist without actually defining it; a Dries Van Noten skirt, a straight sheath of lightweight silk, will always be slim enough to just skim over the hips, but not so slim that it impedes movement. But they are never transgressive, and they are not invitations to reconsider the female form. Cutouts, extreme dimensions, shoulder pads, extravagant volume — you will rarely find these in a Van Noten garment.

And yet in a strange way, Van Noten’s closest peer might be his apparent opposite, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, whom the designer admires and who is, like Van Noten, a member of the very tiny 100-percenter club, internationally recognized fashion designers who own and oversee virtually every aspect of their businesses. (Other members include Giorgio Armani and Raf Simons.) Not aesthetically, of course — Kawakubo’s work is consistently, defiantly avant-garde — but what defines both of their work is an inimitable perspective, a refusal to concede to trends or whims. Their work is instantly recognizable as their own, and because the pieces they produce originate from a single mind, a single vision, they are almost impossible to copy or duplicate (not well, anyway) — a Dries Van Noten piece will never be mistaken for anyone else’s. Fashion, these days, is often meant to stand for something — it is meant to disrupt, to challenge (sometimes literally), it is increasingly expected to have a political statement to share; Van Noten’s fashion, however, stands for nothing but itself, and for the obsessions of the man who created it. It is cool instead of hot; it encourages interiority instead of provocation. In an age that rewards the person who can shout the loudest, the truly radical act is the embrace of the subtle.

Van Noten’s great gift is color. No living designer understands it as well as he does; no other designer has such a rich vocabulary of tone and hue that certain shades, once seen, are impossible to associate with anything other than his clothes. Dior may have had his New Look; Van Noten has a particular blue: brighter than indigo, blacker than a cornflower, deeper than the Pacific. There is also a Dries Van Noten yellow (a rich, yolky marigold); a Dries Van Noten green (the gleaming, dense color of an emerald placed on a square of dark velvet); a Dries Van Noten red (cinnabar-ish and slightly chalky) and a Dries Van Noten purple (a dusty eggplant). But it’s not just the colors themselves that make Van Noten’s clothes so memorable, so resonant; it’s what he does with them, forcing them into strange relationships and juxtapositions that, if you encountered them only as words — persimmon and seashell; compost and moss — might sound unlikely, even occasionally unpleasant. In reality, though, the couplings are revelatory, so effortless that they ask you to reassess the limited way we’ve been encouraged to see color in the first place — why, after all, can’t iris purple pair with camel? Why can’t dulce de leche brown coexist with kelp blue?

Every one of Van Noten’s shows force these reconsiderations, but my favorite is probably his fall 2009 ready-to-wear women’s collection, which appeared, if you blurred your vision a bit, as a series of tonal, Rothkoesque blocks, each hue dyed to just the point where it almost became some other color altogether: a claret-y red-purple sweater above a lichen-y blue-green skirt; a peachy pink-orange skirt worn beneath a grassy gold-green shirt. The clothes in that collection were lovely for other reasons, too — there were sharp, cinch-waisted coats and slouchy, insouciant sweaters (a Van Noten specialty) and a skirt made of soft tiers of shirred and frayed silk that seemed to float in the air like milkweed fluff — but it was dominated by an abstraction, the suggestion that fashion might be not just about how a garment feels on the skin or how it intimates the figure beneath, but about how it tries to express and make sense of color: the natural world’s most enduring, bewitching and elusive bestowment.

We have grown used to speaking of designers as loving a woman’s body — this usually means that they either make clothes that are very sculpting, or clothes that are deliberately unsculpting — but Van Noten’s clothes seem made not so much for a woman’s body as for a woman’s mind: You are drawn to his work because you want to find yourself closer to the person who, you imagine, shuts his eyes and sees such a glorious jumble of color.

ALONG WITH COLOR, Van Noten also has an unrivaled sense of pattern. The designs that ornament his clothes allude to everything from Qing Dynasty decorations and the paintings of Francis Bacon to Ottoman-era iconography and the artist James Reeve’s photographs of cities at night. All designers take from cultures and periods and artists foreign to their own experience, of course, but too often, their tributes feel costume-y, suggesting an invented passion rather than a real one. Van Noten’s borrowings are less literal than they are gestural — yes, the pieces in his fall 2012 collection were covered with stylized Chinese dragons and phoenixes (rendered in a vivid, imperial saffron), but they were pieced alongside shimmering stripes of vermilion and jade of the sort that adorn the canopies of tantric Buddhist temples in Nepal, and Japanese cranes stitched in gold and frozen in midflight. The difference between a designer and a copyist is that a designer makes his source material into something else, something his own; he doesn’t just present it, unchanged and unsynthesized, as work he’s created himself.

Curiously, it is in his wide-ranging eye, in his knowledge of textile and artistic traditions from the world’s great civilizations, that Van Noten announces himself as Flemish. Designers these days rarely work where they were born or became adults — to be in fashion now is to exchange actual citizenship for the parallel universe in which the industry operates, a universe consisting of Milan, Paris, London, New York and maybe Tokyo — and yet Van Noten, who is as well-traveled as any of his peers, continues to reside and work in Antwerp, where he was born, raised and educated. (His current estate, Ringenhof, an 1840s neo-Classical stone house built for a local beer brewer, is a peaceful 30-minute drive from the city center.) When Van Noten was a child, Antwerp was mostly a quiet, bourgeois town, and yet fashion, the idea of it, wasn’t an impossible concept for him. His father, himself descended from a family of tailors, owned several boutiques and made regular trips to Milan and Paris to buy polite, well-constructed Italian and French wares: shoes from Ferragamo, shirts from Charvet. As a teenager, Van Noten acted as the buyer for the children’s department. The stores would occasionally host Saturday-afternoon shows, local models spinning through the space while wearing the season’s new offerings. In making their lives in textiles, in fabrics, in goods from all the countries and cultures surrounding tiny Belgium, the family was following in the Lowlands’ centuries-long legacy of trade, joining the generations of burghers who let their fingertips trace over foreign silks and foreign wools, who measured foreign dyes and foreign powders. If you were a wealthy 13th-century merchant in Bruges, 60 miles west of Antwerp, you would, in a real way, spend your lifetime encountering patterns and colors from lands you could only imagine through their material goods; wonderment would be in your blood. To be Flemish — as Van Noten adamantly is — was to spend your life looking outward and beyond.

This perspective may explain in part why the arrival of the so-called Antwerp Six — a group of early ’80s graduates of the fashion school at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts that included Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester and Walter Van Beirendonck, who together mounted a now-legendary, semi-guerrilla-style show in London in 1986 — was more a surprise to the rest of the world than to the participants themselves. (Martin Margiela is a contemporary of the Antwerp Six, though he wasn’t part of that initial presentation.) Van Noten crossed into adulthood in the 1970s, in the early years of modern cultural globalization, when ideas and aesthetics and music and art traveled faster and farther than ever before in human history. You could be an adolescent in Antwerp and hear punk music from London or West Berlin, and suddenly you would understand that someone out there was creating something that you could be a part of, that you could participate in, that seemed to communicate directly to you. You were seeing images in magazines and on television of people your age or a little older or a little younger doing things that you too might be able to do, and it was transfixing, transformative. For Van Noten, that person was David Bowie, and years later, he paid homage to him — his narrow, bladelike suits, his languor and loucheness — again and again. And it wasn’t just in fashion: All over, in countries both free and not, young people were realizing that what might unite them wasn’t family or heritage or nation, it was music or art or theater or film. They were creating the new wave, the avant-garde, but they had begun doing so as a way of seeking some sort of greater connection — as a way to reach somebody else.

AFTER THE LONDON SHOW, Van Noten returned home and started selling. He had begun his business in men’s wear, and one of his first (and most enduring) clients, Barneys New York, had simply bought the smallest sizes from his collection and sold them as women’s wear. Three years later, in 1989, he moved his small boutique into a five-floor former department store in a run-down section of town and began in earnest the business of being a fashion designer.

He never stopped. Absent from Van Noten’s three-decade career are stories of bankruptcy, strife, irresponsibility, overleverage, overexpansion, overspending or unhinged, dangerous effulgence. He worked slowly and carefully; he did only what he wanted to, when he wanted to. Along the way, there were challenges (global recessions, a luxury market that grew ever more fickle, trends and fads and gimmicks to withstand) and triumphs: a women’s boutique in Paris in 2007; a second in Tokyo and a men’s wear boutique in Paris in 2009; a sumptuous exhibition, “Inspirations,” one of the few granted to a living designer, at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs in 2014. But what remained constant was Van Noten’s discipline, his aversion to self-indulgence, to folly, his adherence to a rigor that announces itself in his designs and in his conduct: a sense of discipline that, paradoxically, has earned him extraordinary artistic freedom. He has to make compromises — every creative person does, in one way or another — but he rarely has to make concessions. Today, he controls every element of his business. (He collaborates on the line’s shoes with a manufacturer.) He will tell you, without apology, that he wants his clothes to sell; that he makes his clothes to sell. His business, its longevity and health, is a reminder that one of the most seductive fictions of fashion is that it exists as a pure aesthetic expression — and yet those who believe this are those who disappear after a year or five, comets whose tails fade quickly into the glittering black.

A visit to Van Noten’s offices, now headquartered in a 60,000-square-foot, six-floor waterfront warehouse, recalls in many ways a visit to his gardens: Here is Van Noten’s other world, or a continuation of it, the place where he executes those ideas, those images, those strange colors he imagines while strolling among Ringenhof’s hollyhocks and smoke trees. If you begin at the top floor showroom and work downward, you can see the entire operation unfold before you, from the design team’s desks, some fitted with a little cabinet stuffed with scraps of deliciously colored swatches of silks, jacquards, wools, jerseys and cottons, and continuing down through the financial department, the sales department, the production and distribution departments and the archives. But it is the ground floor — the shipping department — that is somehow both the most moving and most impressive. When I visited, the first deliveries of the fall collection were arriving. Each garment is sorted, inspected and then boxed. Van Noten wandered through the maze of boxes — stacked several high, almost scraping the ceilings — pointing out which was going to Moscow, which to Hong Kong, which to Singapore, which to New York; along with eight boutiques, the collection is sold in more than 400 stores worldwide. He appeared, in those moments, a touch bewildered — or maybe simply awe-struck. It was a Willy Wonka kind of fantasy, to stand in a building in your hometown among hundreds of cartons packed with things you had dreamed up, all of them destined for places that you might never have imagined visiting as a child growing up not far from here, but now would be worn by people you would never meet in lands your ancestors would never have been able to see for themselves.

By now it was time for lunch, which would be served in the studio. Back upstairs we entered a high-ceilinged, near-empty room, where the page proofs of one of the designer’s upcoming books, a career survey, were laid on the ground. Last March, in Paris, Van Noten mounted his hundredth show, a joyous anthology of his signature, most Dries-like patterns and textures from across the years, many worn by some of his earliest models, now mostly in their late 40s. It was a reminder of the totality, the singularity of his vision, of how each season is in conversation with the last, of how, when you see a Dries Van Noten collection, you are seeing the latest installment in the sartorial equivalent of what the novelist David Mitchell calls an “über-book”: All of his works (in Mitchell’s case, fiction; in Van Noten’s case, fashion) are part of some grander mosaic that is visible only to its creator, and yet, equally, are revealing of some invisible part of its creator’s mind. This is why you can wear a Dries Van Noten dress or shift or skirt from any season at anytime, and although fellow members of the Van Noten tribe will recognize it as his, it will always look relevant, and surprising — a chapter in a book you love, but not one that is immediately nameable.

Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows. Here was the Turkish-inflected fall 2006 collection, with its patterns of Mughal-esque tulips, blown up exaggeratedly large, and the India-inspired fall 1996 show with its translucent, shocking chartreuse blouses and fragile, sparkling, sari-like column skirts. Together, we ambled up one row and then down another, looking at the photos at our feet, bursts of color against the cool cement. I asked him the lazy question you should never ask any artist — did he have a favorite look, a favorite show? — and he, like most artists, demurred. But then he corrected himself: Most of the collections were represented by only six pages, he said; if he really liked them, he might have devoted eight to them, or 10, or even 14. Once again, we began to move, counting the pages, calling out to each other — 10! 12! — and pausing at particularly striking works: a chiffon and burnt velvet caftan, a men’s coat so heavy with embroidery it resembled armor. If every life is a collection of images, too many to process and too many to remember, then this book was, in a real way, his life, or part of it, anyway: a beautiful life, one perfect in its wholeness and conception. To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?

We stopped before a picture of one of my favorite dresses, a gently draped silk sheath, its top a pattern of slashy lilac dashes against a bark-colored background; its bottom an almost Impressionistic blur of blue irises. I remembered this collection, this piece: It was from spring 2008, and I didn’t have the money to buy it. I would go to the store and try it on, and then I would have to leave it behind.

“This is one of the most gorgeous things I’ve seen,” I said.

Artists, no matter how well they might learn to project otherwise, are rarely humble people. Or rather, they are and they aren’t — to be an artist is, often, to live in the thin, unhappy space between arrogance and self-hatred, with one word tipping you over the line in one direction or another. Maybe that’s not the case for Van Noten, who doesn’t brag, doesn’t boast. But for a few seconds, he didn’t speak. His handsome face twitched into a suggestion of a frown. He stared at the dress as he’d stared at that rose, that rose that had so surprised him.

“A beautiful dress,” I repeated. He continued looking at the picture of that dress on the ground before us, something so lovely — the dull shimmer of the silk, the Dries Van Noten blue of the flowers — that not even he could claim otherwise. Sometimes, even the Depressed Gardener’s only move is to surrender to the enchantment of the thing before him.

In theory, lawmakers are supposed to pass an annual budget resolution to provide a blueprint for federal spending and revenues. The document is not signed by the president and does not hold the force of law, but it is an important step in what, in theory, should be an orderly annual budget process.

But in a development that has shocked no one on Capitol Hill, this year’s budget process, for the 2018 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, has not proceeded with any great efficiency.

Congress is supposed to adopt a budget resolution by April 15, giving the House and Senate Appropriations Committees plenty of time to proceed with their work on spending bills before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.

Instead, the Senate is moving on a budget for a fiscal year that has already begun.

“Look at the date,” Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and a member of the Budget Committee, said on Wednesday.

Senators are not even pretending that plotting out the government’s finances is the task at hand, even after the budget deficit reached an estimated $668 billion in the fiscal year that just ended, up $82 billion from the year before.

“Let’s be candid about what this is about,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania and a member of the Budget Committee. “The budget resolution is about giving us the tool to later this year pass tax reform.”

In other words, the budget is not really about the budget.

“It’s a misnomer,” Mr. Toomey said.

In fact, as senators debated the budget resolution this week, they have focused on the merits of the coming tax bill, not spending levels and programs to fund and defund.

In that sense, it has been a legislative debate about legislation that does not yet exist. But that has not tamped down the strong feelings among Republicans and Democrats alike, with Republicans expressing great hopes of powerful economic growth and Democrats warning against providing tax cuts to the rich.

Before the budget is approved, the Senate will undertake a tedious ritual known as a “vote-a-rama,” in which senators can offer an endless series of amendments.

The vote-a-rama provides the minority party with a chance to force the majority to take politically uncomfortable votes. As Republicans lay the groundwork for their tax bill, Democrats plan to extract as much political pain as they can.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the amendments proposed by Democrats this week would shine a light on the Republican tax plan.

“The more people see of this tax bill, the less they will like it,” he said.

The Senate’s budget document will still need to be reconciled with the House’s blueprint, which lawmakers in that chamber approved Oct. 5.

In the meantime, Republican senators are not urging anyone to pick up the budget blueprint if they are in need of reading material.

“Every budget that’s put out by either side of the aisle is a total joke,” Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, observed recently. “It’s not worth the paper that it’s written on.”

“To spend more than five minutes looking at the budget,” he added, “is like spending five minutes too much time on it.”","For the Senate’s Budget Blueprint, It’s Better Late Than Never",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/senate-budget-blueprint.html

Bobby Flay, the chef and restaurateur known for brash flavors and energy-driven dining rooms, and his partner, Laurence Kretchmer, have announced they will close Bar Americain, their American brasserie in Midtown, after service on Jan. 17, 2018. They said, in a statement, that renewing the lease for the restaurant, in the AXA Equitable Center, would require an expensive overhaul, which they were unwilling to undertake at this time. They hinted at new projects on the horizon, to which they preferred to devote their resources.

“Like Broadway shows, restaurants have their runs,” Mr. Flay said. “We’ve had a good run. But there’s no secret that it’s exorbitant to build and run a restaurant today.”

The restaurant, which opened in 2005, was awarded two stars that year by Frank Bruni of The New York Times, who remarked on how the food as well as the décor by David Rockwell delivered a vibrant orange glow (think sweet potato gratin for one). Other specialties included American classics like cioppino, Kentucky hot browns, rack of pork, fried chicken and spice-rubbed steaks. The restaurant replaced Judson Grill, which was owned by Mr. Kretchmer’s father, Jerry Kretchmer, and other partners. It opened in 1994 and went on to shine a spotlight on the chef Bill Telepan.

Judson Grill was a replacement for Sam’s, also brasserie-style and owned by Mariel Hemingway and partners, which was one of the three original restaurants in the complex, which opened in 1987, all fine-dining pioneers in Midtown West at the time. The others were the Italian restaurant, Palio, which closed, and Le Bernardin, which is still going strong with four stars in The New York Times and three from Michelin.

In the Sept. 23 election, the center-left Labour Party won 46 seats, and its left-leaning allies the Greens won eight, giving the left bloc a total of 54.

The close result set off a scramble between the two groups to win the favor of New Zealand First, a populist party that won nine seats — enough to put either National, or the Greens and Labour, over the line in forming a government.

In the kingmaker position was New Zealand First’s leader, Winston Peters, an eccentric veteran politician who has long campaigned on cuts to immigration, curtailing foreign ownership of New Zealand land, and securing pensions and other benefits for retirees, who make up a large percentage of the party’s base of support.

While those issues were not at the forefront of political debate ahead of the election, they were thrust front and center after the vote as both major parties spent the last month wooing Mr. Peters with policy proposals.

Mr. Peters, 72, has been in this position twice before: once in 1996, in a coalition with National that fell apart two years later, and in a coalition with Labour in 2005. He has a famously truculent relationship with the news media and remained tight-lipped throughout the coalition negotiation process, leaving analysts speculating about whom he would anoint as prime minister.

In throwing his support to Ms. Ardern, Mr. Peters said, “It’s time for capitalism to regain its human face.”

Ms. Ardern took control of the Labour Party in July after its leader, Andrew Little, quit amid dismal poll numbers. She enjoyed a wave of attention for her charisma, for her youth, and for condemning a television commentator’s question about whether employers have a right to know whether a woman plans to become a parent.

During the campaign, she emphasized issues including child poverty, environmental management and housing affordability.

The campaign was raucous, at least by the standards of New Zealand, a prosperous member of the Commonwealth that has largely been spared the divisive debate over migration that has roiled its larger neighbor, Australia.

Mr. English, a former finance minister, had taken the reins of the country in December after his predecessor, John Key, unexpectedly resigned, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. During the campaign, Mr. English emphasized the party’s stewardship of the economy, which has recovered strongly from the financial crisis that was underway when the National Party swept to power in 2008.

Before Ms. Ardern captured Labour’s leadership, the party had cycled through five leaders since the last Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, lost the 2008 election. None of those leaders managed to cut into National’s popularity — which was buoyed by New Zealand’s strong economy — but Ms. Ardern’s call for change and youthful energy invigorated her party, winning it new supporters.

After discussing its role in the new government, the Green Party said it would not be a formal part of the Labour-New Zealand First coalition but would lend its votes to help the government pass laws.

The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.
Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents.
(That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.)","Alarmed, Jake’s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

Photo

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

Before walking back to his dorm, where Jake’s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A’s that semester.

SPECIAL POST — The 12th World Sudoku Championship, which I’ve attended in Bangalore, India, has just ended. It was the largest WSC to date — 206 competitors from 32 countries. Most countries were represented by four-person teams, although individual solvers could take part as well.

The contestants tackled almost 150 tough sudoku and sudoku variations over two days, scoring points for correct solutions. Point values varied according to the difficulty of the puzzles.

When it was over, the top five teams were China, Japan, France, USA and Czech Republic. China and Japan towered over everyone else.

The top individual solvers were Kota Morinishi of Japan (4,890 points) and Tiit Vunk of Estonia (4,887), with only 3 points separating them.

That’s because their rankings included overseas teams who traveled to the United States to play in some of the preseason games.
And while the Thunder will be trying to contend for a title, the Knicks will be deploying a small army of big men.
Greatness, of course, is not something that will preoccupy the Knicks this season.","It is a lineup contrasted by the best team in the Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers, who plan to start Kevin Love, normally a mobile power forward, at center. And many clubs are trying to emulate the Golden State Warriors’ brand of nearly positionless basketball.

“The game is changing,” D’Antoni said during his visit to New York. “The game has changed. Offense has changed in the last 10 years radically just because the players have gotten better, they shoot the ball better. Offense has opened up. The 3-point line — everybody shoots now. So offense has changed radically.”

It could for the Knicks, too, but it won’t happen immediately. They plan to start Porzingis and will probably have another big man on the court with him a good deal of the time. In that regard, the Knicks can choose from a list that includes the 6-foot-11 Enes Kanter, obtained in the trade that sent Anthony to Oklahoma City; the 6-11 Willy Hernangomez; the 6-10 Kyle O’Quinn; and the 6-11 Joakim Noah — when he returns from a drug suspension that will keep him out for the first 12 games of the season (he received a 20-game penalty but sat out eight games at the end of last season).

The Knicks also have Luke Kornet, a 7-foot-1 rookie out of Vanderbilt who is set to spend some of his time playing for their development-league team.

Last season, just nine teams had two big men — 6-foot-10 or taller — on the court at once for at least half the game, on average, according to the sports data company Stats LLC. And small-ball lineups outscored traditional ones by 1.2 points per 100 possessions last season, according to research done by the basketball analytics site Nylon Calculus.

The fact that the Knicks have so many big men at the moment is not really by design. Kanter was essentially acquired because his sizable contract helped balance out the money involved in the Anthony deal. Noah is in the second season of an expensive four-year contract that the Knicks’ revamped front office — with the new team president Steve Mills and new General Manager Scott Perry — would surely unload if it could.

Photo

On the other hand, Porzingis and Hernangomez are viewed as part of the future core of the team, but whether the Knicks can cope defensively with both of them on the court together in the current, high-octane N.B.A. is an intriguing question.

For now, what is clear is that Anthony is gone, Tim Hardaway Jr. has returned as an expensive free-agent swingman and a lot of tall people are on the roster. And one more thing: The Knicks, in the preseason, did not look good at all.

They went 0-5 in their exhibition games and their defense, which had been such a sore spot last season, looked even worse. The Knicks gave up 112.6 points per game and finished 32nd in defensive rating for the preseason.

Yes, 32nd in a 30-team league. That’s because their rankings included overseas teams who traveled to the United States to play in some of the preseason games. So the only teams with a worse defense than the Knicks this preseason turned out to be the Shanghai Sharks, Guangzhou Long-Lions, Sydney Kings and Maccabi Haifa.

In any case, the preseason is over. On Thursday night, the Knicks will open their regular season in Oklahoma City against none other than Anthony and his two renowned teammates — Paul George and Russell Westbrook. And while the Thunder will be trying to contend for a title, the Knicks will be deploying a small army of big men.

Which is fine with Kanter. “It’s good,” he said. “That means we’ve got an advantage. We can rebound better. We can protect the rim better. I think it’s going to work fine.”

If it does to any degree, it will be because Porzingis bears the burden of being the star of the team and absorbs being the target of opposing defenses and, just as important, stays healthy. He had a number of physical setbacks during his first two seasons and is already battling a hip injury that forced him to miss the preseason finale.

The Knicks also need 19-year-old Frank Ntilikina, their first-round draft pick out of France, to finally get healthy after missing all of the summer league and most of the preseason with knee injuries. He is a 6-foot-5 point guard with enormous potential, but he has yet to gain any real N.B.A. experience.

Meanwhile, the Knicks’ coach, Jeff Hornacek, maintains his club will be a transformed team from last season and will play with more pace. And perhaps a healthy Ntilikina and Hardaway and someone like the 6-foot-5 Courtney Lee can help make that happen. If nothing else, the Knicks are no longer obsessed by the triangle offense so beloved by Phil Jackson, the former team president.

Finally, there is this: On the first day of training camp, Hornacek assigned the team a book — “Chop Wood Carry Water: How to Fall in Love with the Process of Becoming Great.” He asked the players to read it and had them discuss different chapters each morning.

Greatness, of course, is not something that will preoccupy the Knicks this season. Progress is another matter, and how much takes place will be the primary issue. Who will be on the court is another.

The series’ most promising innovation has been making the protagonist not the crew’s captain but an outsider. Burnham, a human raised by the superrational Vulcans, wants to redeem herself but resists Lorca’s any-means-necessary ruthlessness. (Ms. Martin-Green’s ice-cool performance is layered, but it’s a handicap for a series to center on a character who’s trained to suppress emotion.)

Burnham exemplifies many of the ideals that we once saw in captains Kirk, Picard et al. — respect for the rights of sentient species, the sense of wonder in exploration, restraint in the use of science. But amid the wartime exigencies of “Discovery” these notions are under siege, not ascendant. The potentially fruitful question of “Discovery” is to ask: what happens to your principles when they become inconvenient?

But a little more than halfway through the season’s first eight-episode run (the “second chapter” begins in January), the story lacks momentum. The dialogue is stilted. The chemistry among the still-forming central team is shaky. The series doesn’t have a voice so much as a mood, and that mood is, usually, a bummer.

Some fans have complained that “Discovery” has betrayed the idealistic, optimistic spirit of its earlier fleetmates. I don’t think that’s the problem. “Star Trek” is a kind of national mythology, and it has every right, maybe even the creative obligation, to change to suit its times. (Weirdly, Fox’s joke-not-a-joke “The Orville” is more slavishly like the original series.) Two decades ago, “Deep Space Nine” (for my money the best “Trek”) also focused on the compromises of war.

Rather, “Discovery” feels like it’s adrift between the adventure-of-the-week format of its network-TV predecessors and the kind of complex serial favored by cable and streaming. It has the trappings of serious pay-TV drama: darkness, willingness to kill major characters “Game of Thrones”-style, even profanity. (This “Trek” sets its phasers to “F.”) But they’re mostly superficial.

The most direct antecedent for “Discovery” might not be any “Trek” series but the 2004–09 reboot of “Battlestar Galactica.” That series was also a bleaker riff on a previous series, turning the struggle of humanity against the Cylons — a society of robots that mankind created — into one of the best fictional treatments of the war on terror. Ingeniously, it rethought the Cylons as monotheistic zealots, murderous but with a culture and ideals that could not be easily dismissed.

It would seem that “Discovery” wants to do something similar for the Klingons, the alien enemies (and eventually, allies) who, here, have just united against the Federation. Here, they’re isolationists whose rallying cry — “Remain Klingon!” — one producer has said intentionally echoes Trump-era nationalism.

These Klingons also have elements of cultlike fanaticism, and there’s reference to their having carried out “terrorist” attacks. (They’ve also gotten a makeover, with more prominent prosthetics than their old forehead ridges.) The result is a generic, bellicose mishmash of an enemy, whose subtitle-heavy scenes slow the show down rather than add depth.

There are flashes of promise, especially in the supporting characters. Doug Jones stands out as Lieutenant Saru, whose sensitivity to danger comes from belonging to a species that was bred as prey. His genetically wired wariness, like the spore-drive story, suggests a “Trek” attuned to biology like its predecessors were to physics.

“Discovery” can be effectively eerie and moody. But it’s not urgent or inventive in a way that cuts through the somberness.

4) 9 A.M. Lakeside

While tourists tend to explore Alster lake on one of the gentle cruises departing from Jungfernstieg, Hamburg residents use it as an exceptionally scenic exercise track, jogging or cycling through beautiful parks and leafy, exclusive neighborhoods. The lake is made up of two parts — the smaller Binnenalster and the large expanse of the Aussenalster (literally, inner and outer Alster) — and functions as a sort of liquid Central Park, a restful enclave exhorting the restive city around it to relax. Get a city bike at one of the stands at Jungfernstieg (€5, free for the first 30 minutes), and traverse some of the most picturesque of Hamburg’s approximately 2,500 bridges — more than Amsterdam and Venice combined, or so the locals boast. Stop for a refreshment at the Alsterperle cafe on the northern edge of the lake for a striking view of the city skyline.

5) 11 A.M. Brick Expressionism

Stroll south through two areas that have been added to the list of Unesco World Heritage sites in recent years. The Kontorhausviertel, or office quarter, boasts the finest examples of Hamburg’s distinctive early 20th-century architectural style, known as brick expressionism: large red brick buildings with ornate facades. The most renowned is the Flatiron-style Chilehaus. Nearby, in the Speicherstadt, the old warehouse district, the rows of neo-Gothic, red brick buildings standing tall over canals are, in many ways, predecessors to the huge port that has grown up on the south side of the Elbe.

6) 1 P.M. The New Concert Hall

Imperiously perched at the western tip of the gleaming new Hafencity — one of the largest urban regeneration projects in Europe — is the stunning Elbphilharmonie. Designed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, it was dogged by controversy throughout its construction, which ran five years late and hundreds of millions of euro over budget, ultimately costing €789 million. However, the initial skepticism was quickly dispelled when it finally opened in January, the public christening it with an affectionate nickname, the Elphi, and all performances sold out for months in advance. A sturdy old brick warehouse serves as the base to a soaring rippled glass structure that culminates in a crown of peaks resembling billowing circus tents. The juxtaposition of brick and glass, old and new, practically begs to be seen as a metaphor for Hamburg’s marriage of traditional and modern industries. There are long queues to get to the viewing platform, but you can book online for a specific time (€2 booking free), and there is limited availability on tours (€15) of the building and the extraordinary concert hall itself, a steeply tiered bowl with the orchestra pit at the base. While on the plaza level, stop by the Störtebeker cafe — the lunch menu ranges from smoked salmon sandwiches (€13.50) to steak tartare (€16.50) — and take in the views of the port.

7) 4 P.M. Steel Sailboat

Walk along the new undulating walkway designed by the late Zaha Hadid that is taking shape on the banks of the Elbe, and visit the permanently docked Rickmer Rickmers(€5), a 121-year-old steel sailboat that gives a vivid impression of what life at sea was like for the generations of sailors who made fleeting visits to Hamburg.

8) 5 P.M. Beach Bars and Cargo Ships

From the floating piers at Landungsbrücken, take the 62 ferry west along the Elbe (€3.20 round-trip) for about 15 minutes until you reach Övelgönne, an old fishing village with a long stretch of sand. At the far end sits the lively Strandperle beach bar, where you can sip a drink while watching cargo ships being tended to by a row of giant cranes on the other side of the river. The sight of a container ship being gradually unloaded is oddly mesmerising, a slow-moving choreography that offers a glimpse into the mechanics of global trade.

9) 8 P.M. Sate Your Appetite

Adjacent to the Landungsbrücken is the Portugiesenviertel, a bustling hub of restaurants and cafes, most with a distinctly Portuguese character. The oldest and probably finest is Restaurante Porto, at the intersection of Ditmar-Koel-Strasse and Reimarusstrasse. It serves delicately grilled fresh fish and enough potatoes to satisfy the most voracious appetite (€18).

10) 10 P.M. Where the Beatles Played

The thriving St Pauli district, and the local soccer club of the same name, encapsulates Hamburg’s alternative persona and countercultural spirit. Running through the area is the Reeperbahn, a long street that is simultaneously one of the world’s most notorious red light districts and also home to Germany’s biggest collection of musical theaters and an array of pulsing nightclubs.

As anyone who read “IQ” will know, Ide isn’t a one-plot type of writer. He sets many schemes in motion. In the new novel, they involve gambling, a natty Rwandan Hutu gangster who lost one leg to the Tutsi, Chinese triads, money-laundering, human trafficking and a whole lot more. Ide writes about the hostility among ethnic groups — notably black gangs and Chinese triads (whose members’ affectation of American gang habits comes in for some mockery, though their toughness does not) — in ways that would be offensive if they weren’t equal-opportunity insults. The world of these books is one of constant trash talk, and Ide delivers it with style.

None of it comes from Isaiah. He remains the one stand-up guy in the midst of hot- and cold-running human detritus. But eight years have changed him. He’s no longer the boy wonder we first met. He’s a grown man with no concrete future plans who solves neighborhood crimes mostly as favors — until he suddenly discovers motivation. (Dodson is now a family man, settled down with a woman who can talk back to him and a “Lil’ Tupac” expected any day.)

The galvanizing force is Sarita, Marcus’s girlfriend. When Isaiah crosses paths with her again, he starts imagining an adult life with wine, an actual sofa and the woman of his dreams.

Will Ide lead Isaiah toward happiness? The book’s battles play out ingeniously, with Isaiah trying to figure out how he could have been so wrong about Marcus. He is also hired by a seemingly reputable Chinese father to rescue a daughter who has severe gambling problems. A lot of characters crop up in “Righteous”; one reason is that the trail Marcus left was a complicated one, but another is that Ide can’t seem to resist a good subplot when he thinks of one. A third possibility may be that this series plans to move on. Like “IQ,” the new book has an ending that will make you hope for the arrival of another installment, pronto.

“Righteous” takes its title from a quality that Marcus was thought to represent and that Isaiah still embodies. It seems possible, by the novel’s end, that Isaiah has done what he can in East Long Beach and is ready to take on the wider world. It also seems possible that Isaiah may stop working for peanuts — or in one case, “live chickens and blueberry muffins.” And it may be time for Ide to lay to rest Isaiah’s Marcus obsession and give him other things to think about. I can’t wait to find out what they’ll be.","In ‘Righteous,’ a Stand-Up Sleuth Investigates His Brother’s Murder",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/books/review-righteous-joe-ide.html

All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted.
Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago.
Photo“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said.
“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

The language of the new document is more cagey. But the sentiments are chilling.

The report “conflates black political activists with dangerous domestic terrorist organizations that pose actual threats to law enforcement,” the Congressional Black Caucus said in a letter asking for a meeting with the F.B.I.

“It relies on a handful of obviously terrible incidents to paint black Americans who exercise free speech against witnessed police brutality as possible violent extremists,” the letter said. (It was referring to six cases since 2014 in which the F.B.I. said the black identity menace was behind attacks on police officers, including the reprehensible shooting of 11 police officers, five of whom died, in Dallas on July 7, 2016.)

The F.B.I. draws a line from the killing by a police officer of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 to all those other cases and warns of a “surge” in ideologically motivated violence against the police.

The report also draws a line from the activists of the ’60s and ’70s to the “extremists” of today. The black threat, it said, had simply been dormant.

There is no such connection. The F.B.I. failed even to make any real connection among the six incidents it cited.

The authors of the report act as though there is doubt about the institutional racism in our country and in some police forces. (I am not saying all white police officers are racists.)

The F.B.I. document talked about “perceived injustices against African-Americans” — perceived by anyone who is really paying attention.

The counterterrorism division said it “considered” the possibility that violence against the police is not driven by their phantom B.I.E.s but decided that was “very unlikely.”

Fifty years ago, Hoover’s F.B.I. spied on civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. It forged letters to create friction between rival black-power movements, which led to a shooting at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1969 that left two dead. Undercover police officers were responsible for framing 21 Black Panthers for a fake bombing conspiracy in New York in 1969.

The list goes on and on.

There is a slippery slope between this kind of intelligence assessment and acts of repression. The F.B.I. has slid gleefully down that slope before. It must not be allowed to do so again.",The F.B.I.’s Black Phantom Menace,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/columnists/fbi-blacks-civil-rights.html

中国女性史诗小说《喜福会》的作者谭恩美(Amy Tan)在近期出版的回忆录中提到了她的祖母，一位死于可能是故意吸食鸦片过量的“concubine”。这个词通常被翻译为“妾”。在韦氏词典里，它的含义是：

A woman with whom a man cohabits without being married: such as

a：one having a recognized social status in a household below that of a wife

b：a mistress

一个与一名男性同居，但非对方妻子的女人：比如

a：一个家庭里社会地位被认为低于妻子的女人。

b：一个情妇

妾是一个男人的性伴侣，被期望为他生儿育女，却得不到妻子一般的地位认可和继承权。

中国的历史里有许多著名的妾室，比如清朝晚期的慈禧，她是咸丰皇帝的妃子，在作家张戎的笔下，她是一位开启了现代中国的“concubine”。另一位被赋予这个名称的女人是汉末的虞姬。陈凯歌导演的电影《霸王别姬》的英文译名为“Farewell, My Concubine”, 正是这部电影将这个过时的英文词语介绍给了许多观众，一些人也把这个形象与一个落后的中国联系了起来。

然而，纳妾的现象并非中国古代独有，它的本质——利用经济实力和权力地位的不平等进行性剥削——仍在以新的形式在世界各地不断出现。

近期曝光的好莱坞电影大亨哈维·韦恩斯坦层出不穷的性侵犯指控，让现代女性经常面对的性剥削——被拥有权势的上级压迫——爆发性地回到了公众的讨论中。时报本周的文章《漫长的斗争：女性对抗职场性骚扰简史》讲述了美国历史上职场女性充满艰辛和勇气的抗争之路。

韦恩斯坦丑闻引发的讨论也扩散到了中国。具有中国官方背景的英文媒体《中国日报》(China Daily)刚刚撤下一篇备受争议的社论。其作者称，好莱坞性侵事件揭示了中国与西方的文化差异，中国男性从小被教导要保护女性，性骚扰与中国传统文化相悖，极少发生。

你是否同意这篇文章的观点呢？中国历史里身为妾室的女人早已消失，一夫多妻制也在1949年后被废除，这些的确是中国妇女解放事业取得的成就。然而，男权和性别歧视的幽灵真的已经烟消云散了吗？

Not according to the account of the twins’ visit to the White House shortly after the first President Bush’s election, when they were 7.
“We were like Eloise in our Plaza!” Jenna writes.","Those missives included memes: a cartoon bunny that blew kisses before the words “I Love You” exploded like a Roman candle; a snippet of Jason Alexander as George Costanza in “Seinfeld.” There were long, silly strings of colorful, silly icons. From George W. Bush, who had always worked so hard on that Texas swagger?

“He has gone deep into the emojis,” Barbara said. In her contacts he’s identified as Popsicle. In Jenna’s he’s Jefe, which is Spanish for “boss.”

We only think we know the people who wind up, intentionally or not, in the spotlight. We categorize them. Trivialize them. That’s maybe the main plaint and preoccupation of a joint memoir, “Sisters First,” in which Jenna and Barbara each present reminiscences that alternate with the other’s. It will be published on Tuesday.

“What we wanted to write about in the book was the nuance of people that we love,” Barbara said, and they’ve done just that, charting the distance between public image and private reality. The stories that they tell are often self-serving, and they skim over the failures and wages of their father’s presidency. But they do make you question the caricatures that we blithely traffic in, the assumptions that we breezily make and our reluctance to allow for how much the objects of our curiosity can change.

Their father’s late-blooming obsession with painting: Even they didn’t see that one coming. He skipped the trips to art museums that their mother, Laura, took them on when they were kids.

But after his presidency ended in 2009, he got an iPhone, Barbara said, and “discovered this little drawing app and would do little sketches and send them to us.”

Jenna added: “We would say, ‘Hey, Dad, Happy Sunday, what are you up to?’ And he would stick-figure a little airplane.”

“With his little face waving out of it,” Barbara chimed in. That meant that he was flying somewhere.

The book is stippled with insider anecdotes, my favorite of which recounts a meal that Barbara and her mother shared with Silvio Berlusconi in 2006, when he was Italy’s prime minister and Barbara was 24. (She and Jenna are now 35.) Berlusconi complimented her on her blue eyes, told her that she should mate with his son and, for good measure, announced: “If I was younger, I’d have children with you.” Barbara’s loss, obviously, but she has somehow soldiered on.

I told her that when I read that part, I immediately thought of Trump, and of his various comments over the years about the hotness — in Daddy’s eyes — of Ivanka. She didn’t take the bait.

They’re careful, she and Jenna. They have made clear over the years that they’re not perfect political overlaps with the rest of their family, which is the Republican Party’s great modern dynasty. Barbara, for example, appeared in a video endorsing same-sex marriage back in 2011.

But that’s not the kind of attention they usually court, and during our hours together at Café Altro Paradiso, where Jenna had ricotta dumplings and Barbara swordfish, they repeatedly registered their disgust with the divisiveness of our national conversation. They don’t want to add to the ugliness, which pains Jenna all the more, she said, because she has two daughters, Mila, 4, and Poppy, 2.

“This moment, as a mother, feels a little frightening, because I’m nervous to have the TV on to hear some of the rhetoric that is coming from the highest position,” Jenna said, conspicuously not uttering the syllable “Trump” itself. “The way I speak about elections and the way I speak about everything has changed, because I’m now a role model to two little humans who I want to teach about love and empathy and compassion.”

She and Barbara, who is single, woke up together in Jenna’s bed on the morning after election night, because Jenna’s husband, Henry Hager, was away, and Barbara had come over to watch the returns, which were still being counted into the wee hours. Jenna wouldn’t say if those results disappointed her, but she and Barbara both expressed a fierce wish to see a female president soon.

“One hundred percent,” Jenna said, and again mentioned her girls. “Mila, the other day in the car, goes, ‘Mommy, Poppy rules the world,’ about her baby sister. And I go: ‘Well, Poppy could rule the world. Maybe one day she could be president.’ And Mila goes, ‘But, Mom, presidents are men.’ She said that.”

From mid-1999 to late-2001 I covered their father’s campaign and the start of his presidency, and I remember seeing them on the fringes of events. I also remember the media’s sometimes cheap fascination with them when they went off to college — Jenna to the University of Texas, Barbara to Yale — and were repeatedly caught consuming alcohol before they were legally old enough to.

“Jenna and Tonic” was a headline in The New York Post. People magazine went with “Double Trouble,” while Newsweek opted for “Busted Again in Margaritaville.” They were embarrassed, yes, but also frustrated by what they insist were exaggerations in many accounts.

Back then I was never formally introduced to either of them. But perhaps five years ago, Barbara visited me at The Times to discuss the Global Health Corps, a public-health analogue to the Peace Corps and Teach for America that sends more than 100 recent college graduates annually into the most impoverished areas of the world. She founded it, raised money for it, is its chief executive and spends plenty of time in those places herself.

Partly because of her focus on health but largely to stir up trouble, I asked her and Jenna, whom I was meeting for the first time, about Trump’s move to make it easier for employers to deny coverage of birth control. He’d announced that just hours before our lunch.

“It does feel like we’re going backwards in some ways,” Jenna said, “and that’s probably as much as I can say.”

Is she pro-choice?

“I can’t say,” she answered. “I’d be in trouble at work.”

Barbara?

“I am very for women having everything they need to live healthy, dignified lives,” she told me.

“Is that a yes?” I asked.

“I think women should be able to make the right decision that would allow them to live — truly allow them to live,” she said.

Jenna shook her head: “He might have wanted a yes or no.” Indeed he might have.

Photo

Their father opposed abortion rights but their mother stayed mum, vaguely identifying herself as pro-choice only after the couple left the White House. That approximated the trajectory of her mother-in-law, the former first lady Barbara Bush, who pops up frequently in “Sisters First” and, like the rest of the clan, isn’t exactly who you expect.

Regal? Entitled? Not according to the account of the twins’ visit to the White House shortly after the first President Bush’s election, when they were 7. They discovered the bowling lane in the basement and, using the phone there, asked a staffer to bring them peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

“We were like Eloise in our Plaza!” Jenna writes. “When the door opened, it was not our sandwiches, but our Ganny, who appeared and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not in a hotel, but temporary guests in a historic home, and we were never to do that again.”

Laura Bush is “quiet and bookish,” Barbara writes, but then again not: “Beneath her flats and cardigans, my mom is in fact our closet hippie and Rastafarian.” She dragged Barbara, then a teenager, to a reggae concert in Austin, Tex.

Barbara also writes that while her father can be “loud and unthoughtful,” he “outreads us all.” After Barbara went through her first devastating romantic breakup a few years ago, he called or texted her daily, “just to check in, just to share the burden with me.”

The twins portray him as surprisingly self-effacing.

During his presidency, they spotted an anti-Bush bumper sticker with a withering put-down, and they not only told him about it but turned it into a running family joke. “Now,” Barbara writes, “this line comes up regularly when we want to rib our former-leader-of-the-free-world father: ‘Well, somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot.’ ”

After Jenna, covering the Golden Globes for NBC, conflated two movies about African-Americans by referring to “Hidden Fences,” he quickly texted her to remind her that where verbal pratfalls were concerned, he’d been there, done that and survived. She would, too.

Jenna and Barbara told me that for as long as they can remember, he has brought their mother coffee in bed every morning, including when he was in the White House, because he’s always up first. He brings them coffee in bed when they visit.

They seemed to me a long, long way from Margaritaville. They’re not the Manhattan party fixtures they could easily be. They show considerable restraint. They also show generosity.

Back Story

“When something outrages you,” he wrote, “as Nazism did me, that is when you become a militant, strong and engaged.”

Born on this day in 1917, Stéphane Hessel, a French Resistance hero and Holocaust survivor, became an unlikely publishing phenomenon in 2011 at the age of 93, topping best-seller lists with “Indignez-Vous!”

At only about 4,000 words, “Indignez-Vous!” (“Time for Outrage!”) was more of a pamphlet. But it resonated with French readers who were gearing up for a presidential election, and those abroad who were protesting the eurozone crisis, participating in the Arab Spring uprisings and occupying Wall Street.

Mr. Hessel, above, urged young people to revive the spirit of the resistance by peacefully protesting the financial markets, France’s treatment of illegal immigrants, the influence of the rich on the news media and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

“Indignez-Vous!” sold more than three million copies in Europe in less than a year and was translated into more than a dozen languages. (The Nation magazine published the full text in English.)

Mr. Hessel died in 2013, but his call to outrage endures: “You join the movement of history,” he wrote, “and the great current of history continues to flow only thanks to each and every one of us.”

The Bush family has never been fond of Mr. Trump, who beat former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida for the Republican presidential nomination last year. Neither the former president nor his father, former President George Bush, voted for Mr. Trump last November. But advisers said the younger Mr. Bush has been deeply troubled by the state of the national debate under a president who routinely demonizes his adversaries on Twitter.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry and compromises the moral education of children,” Mr. Bush said in his speech. “The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.”

Mr. Bush, who issued a statement with his father condemning white supremacists after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August, returned to the theme. “Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,” he said.

Along with the conference, the president released a paper examining threats to the liberal democratic order and making recommendations for protecting and strengthening American institutions. The paper was drafted by Peter H. Wehner, a former adviser in Mr. Bush’s White House, and Thomas O. Melia, a former State Department official under President Barack Obama.

The conference also featured a panel with two former secretaries of state, Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine K. Albright, joining Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Ms. Rice, who served under Mr. Bush, and Ms. Albright, who served under President Bill Clinton, seemed to gently coach Ms. Haley, urging the Trump administration to rethink its cuts to the State Department budget and its approach to the United Nations, to protect rather than attack the news media and to make a stronger response to Russian meddling in last year’s election.

Ms. Albright said the disparity between the Pentagon and State Department budgets was “crazy” and deprived the president of necessary resources. “We do not have a lot of tools,” she said. “It is necessary to have a functioning diplomatic service.”

Ms. Haley said the president’s budget proposal to slash the State Department budget by one-third was not meant to be enacted in its original form. “It was just his conversation point,” she said. “He was starting a conversation.”

Ms. Rice and Ms. Albright also pressed the administration to take Russia’s interference in last year’s election more seriously. Ms. Rice, a longtime Russia scholar, said that past Soviet disinformation campaigns were “clumsy” but last year’s effort was “highly sophisticated.”

“My own view is if they do this to us once it’s their fault,” she said. “If they do this to us twice, it’s ours.”

That is one area where Ms. Haley has been in agreement, even though she is working for a president who derides the “Russia story” as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats and the media.

“The Russians, God bless them, they’re saying, ‘Why are Americans anti-Russian and why have we done the sanctions?’” Ms. Haley said. “Well, don’t interfere in our elections and we won’t be anti-Russian. We have to be so hard on this and we have to hold them accountable.”

Mr. Bush echoed that in his own speech. “America has experienced a sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our country’s divisions,” he said. “According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other.” He added: “We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our election system from subversion.”

The former president acknowledged the forces of discontent that have given rise to Mr. Trump. “We should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization,” he said. “People are hurting. They’re angry and they’re frustrated. We must hear and help them. But we cannot wish globalization away any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”","Without Saying ‘Trump,’ George W.

Neither the former president nor his father, former President George Bush, voted for Mr. Trump last November. But advisers said the younger Mr. Bush has been deeply troubled by the state of the national debate under a president who routinely demonizes his adversaries on Twitter.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry and compromises the moral education of children,” Mr. Bush said in his speech. “The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.”

Mr. Bush, who issued a statement with his father condemning white supremacists after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August, returned to the theme. “Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,” he said.

Along with the conference, the president released a paper examining threats to the liberal democratic order and making recommendations for protecting and strengthening American institutions. The paper was drafted by Peter H. Wehner, a former adviser in Mr. Bush’s White House, and Thomas O. Melia, a former State Department official under President Barack Obama.

The conference also featured a panel with two former secretaries of state, Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine K. Albright, joining Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Ms. Rice, who served under Mr. Bush, and Ms. Albright, who served under President Bill Clinton, seemed to gently coach Ms. Haley, urging the Trump administration to rethink its cuts to the State Department budget and its approach to the United Nations, to protect rather than attack the news media and to make a stronger response to Russian meddling in last year’s election.

Ms. Albright said the disparity between the Pentagon and State Department budgets was “crazy” and deprived the president of necessary resources. “We do not have a lot of tools,” she said. “It is necessary to have a functioning diplomatic service.”

Ms. Haley said the president’s budget proposal to slash the State Department budget by one-third was not meant to be enacted in its original form. “It was just his conversation point,” she said. “He was starting a conversation.”

Ms. Rice and Ms. Albright also pressed the administration to take Russia’s interference in last year’s election more seriously. Ms. Rice, a longtime Russia scholar, said that past Soviet disinformation campaigns were “clumsy” but last year’s effort was “highly sophisticated.”

“My own view is if they do this to us once it’s their fault,” she said. “If they do this to us twice, it’s ours.”

That is one area where Ms. Haley has been in agreement, even though she is working for a president who derides the “Russia story” as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats and the media.

“The Russians, God bless them, they’re saying, ‘Why are Americans anti-Russian and why have we done the sanctions?’” Ms. Haley said. “Well, don’t interfere in our elections and we won’t be anti-Russian. We have to be so hard on this and we have to hold them accountable.”

Mr. Bush echoed that in his own speech. “America has experienced a sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our country’s divisions,” he said. “According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other.” He added: “We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our election system from subversion.”

The former president acknowledged the forces of discontent that have given rise to Mr. Trump. “We should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization,” he said. “People are hurting. They’re angry and they’re frustrated. We must hear and help them. But we cannot wish globalization away any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”","Without Saying ‘Trump,’ George W.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

In nontheme news, there’s some really nice fill in Mr. Guzzetta’s and Mr. Hawkins’s grid. I liked NOSE JOB, POWER NAP, SO MEAN, MAIN MAN, SOUR MASH, EASY NOW, AWAY GAME, CHEEZIT, EVEN STEVEN, STONE TOOL, MEDIA STORM and TOY GUN.

The article cited a text message indicating that Nxivm’s leader, Keith Raniere, who is known as “Vanguard,” was aware that some female members were being branded and that the symbol used contained his initials as a “tribute” to him.

Late Wednesday, Nxivm released a statement through an affiliate, stating that an unnamed media outlet had “unfoundedly, and incorrectly, linked NXIVM corporation, and its related companies, with a social group.”

The statement asserted that the article “might be a criminal product of criminal minds,” and said NXIVM “will explore any and all legal remedies.”

“NXIVM was not able to participate in this story because it painfully held true to the due process of our free world justice system,” the statement said.

During a three-month period, officials of Nxivm did not respond to repeated requests by The Times for interviews and responses. Neither Dr. Porter nor Dr. Roberts responded to repeated inquiries.

Mr. Azzopardi said in his statement: “The allegations in this article are disturbing. Counsel’s Office will be reviewing this matter to determine if applicable laws, regulations and procedures were followed by the agencies cited in this report and that review will determine if further action is warranted.”

In a letter, the State Department of Health declined to take action on a complaint filed in July against Dr. Roberts because she had not been acting as a doctor treating a patient when she reportedly performed branding.

In a separate complaint filed in August, a former member of Nxivm, Jennifer Kobelt, 28, described Dr. Porter as the physician who treated Mr. Raniere’s followers when they got ill and the “main scientist” who conducted tests involving the group.

Last year, Ms. Kobelt said, Dr. Porter drove her to a former restaurant called Apropos in Clifton Park, N.Y., a town not far from Albany that is now used by Nxivm as a meeting center.

There, he showed her a series of video clips, three of which were so violent that the images “have haunted me for almost a year now,” she stated in her complaint.

In of one them, Mexican cartel members are seen killing four women. “Please look into this ASAP,” Ms. Kobelt wrote. “This man needs to be stopped.”

In September, medical regulators informed her that they were declining to act on her complaint because Dr. Porter’s supposed actions did not meet the agency’s definition of “medical misconduct,” their letter shows.

A spokesman for St. Peter’s Hospital said Dr. Porter resigned from his part-time position after officials there met with him to discuss the allegations cited in The Times article.

Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows.
To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?","But if the gardens are, at least to some extent, the source of some of Van Noten’s inspiration, they are also a metaphor for the daily difficulties of running an independent fashion label with the degree of autonomy and oversight that Van Noten has. As we walk through an allée of topiaried cypress, Van Noten says that he and his longtime partner in both business and life, Patrick Vangheluwe, often joke that they’ll someday write a book titled “The Depressed Gardener,” about all the things that can go wrong in a garden, no matter the allowances made for changing climates, unpredictable weather, rapacious insects and on and on. You plan and plan, he says, and something always goes awry anyway. The depressed gardener knows that. He also knows, however, that it is simply what happens when you try to control what cannot be controlled — to be a depressed gardener is to live in a state of constant humility. But it also means a heightened ability to appreciate the strange gifts that circumstance sometimes affords. It means living a life of unknowns, large and small, and yet never ceasing in one’s attempts to coax beauty from even the most forbidding, the meanest of places: the spots of earth that everyone else has overlooked.

TRYING TO EXPLAIN the fever that Van Noten’s clothes induce to someone who’s never seen them is an unsatisfying task, because they in many ways defy what we’ve been taught to admire in contemporary fashion. You don’t, for example, buy a Dries Van Noten dress or shirt or skirt simply for its cut: The shapes, some of which appear season after season, are conventionally feminine and invariably flattering, smartly crafted and architecturally sound. A Dries Van Noten midi-length dress will always be draped in just the right way, so that it allows the illusion of a waist without actually defining it; a Dries Van Noten skirt, a straight sheath of lightweight silk, will always be slim enough to just skim over the hips, but not so slim that it impedes movement. But they are never transgressive, and they are not invitations to reconsider the female form. Cutouts, extreme dimensions, shoulder pads, extravagant volume — you will rarely find these in a Van Noten garment.

And yet in a strange way, Van Noten’s closest peer might be his apparent opposite, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, whom the designer admires and who is, like Van Noten, a member of the very tiny 100-percenter club, internationally recognized fashion designers who own and oversee virtually every aspect of their businesses. (Other members include Giorgio Armani and Raf Simons.) Not aesthetically, of course — Kawakubo’s work is consistently, defiantly avant-garde — but what defines both of their work is an inimitable perspective, a refusal to concede to trends or whims. Their work is instantly recognizable as their own, and because the pieces they produce originate from a single mind, a single vision, they are almost impossible to copy or duplicate (not well, anyway) — a Dries Van Noten piece will never be mistaken for anyone else’s. Fashion, these days, is often meant to stand for something — it is meant to disrupt, to challenge (sometimes literally), it is increasingly expected to have a political statement to share; Van Noten’s fashion, however, stands for nothing but itself, and for the obsessions of the man who created it. It is cool instead of hot; it encourages interiority instead of provocation. In an age that rewards the person who can shout the loudest, the truly radical act is the embrace of the subtle.

Van Noten’s great gift is color. No living designer understands it as well as he does; no other designer has such a rich vocabulary of tone and hue that certain shades, once seen, are impossible to associate with anything other than his clothes. Dior may have had his New Look; Van Noten has a particular blue: brighter than indigo, blacker than a cornflower, deeper than the Pacific. There is also a Dries Van Noten yellow (a rich, yolky marigold); a Dries Van Noten green (the gleaming, dense color of an emerald placed on a square of dark velvet); a Dries Van Noten red (cinnabar-ish and slightly chalky) and a Dries Van Noten purple (a dusty eggplant). But it’s not just the colors themselves that make Van Noten’s clothes so memorable, so resonant; it’s what he does with them, forcing them into strange relationships and juxtapositions that, if you encountered them only as words — persimmon and seashell; compost and moss — might sound unlikely, even occasionally unpleasant. In reality, though, the couplings are revelatory, so effortless that they ask you to reassess the limited way we’ve been encouraged to see color in the first place — why, after all, can’t iris purple pair with camel? Why can’t dulce de leche brown coexist with kelp blue?

Every one of Van Noten’s shows force these reconsiderations, but my favorite is probably his fall 2009 ready-to-wear women’s collection, which appeared, if you blurred your vision a bit, as a series of tonal, Rothkoesque blocks, each hue dyed to just the point where it almost became some other color altogether: a claret-y red-purple sweater above a lichen-y blue-green skirt; a peachy pink-orange skirt worn beneath a grassy gold-green shirt. The clothes in that collection were lovely for other reasons, too — there were sharp, cinch-waisted coats and slouchy, insouciant sweaters (a Van Noten specialty) and a skirt made of soft tiers of shirred and frayed silk that seemed to float in the air like milkweed fluff — but it was dominated by an abstraction, the suggestion that fashion might be not just about how a garment feels on the skin or how it intimates the figure beneath, but about how it tries to express and make sense of color: the natural world’s most enduring, bewitching and elusive bestowment.

We have grown used to speaking of designers as loving a woman’s body — this usually means that they either make clothes that are very sculpting, or clothes that are deliberately unsculpting — but Van Noten’s clothes seem made not so much for a woman’s body as for a woman’s mind: You are drawn to his work because you want to find yourself closer to the person who, you imagine, shuts his eyes and sees such a glorious jumble of color.

Amy Adams Greats Cover Dries van Noten is featured on one of the covers of T's Oct. 22 Greats issue. See the other six covers

ALONG WITH COLOR, Van Noten also has an unrivaled sense of pattern. The designs that ornament his clothes allude to everything from Qing Dynasty decorations and the paintings of Francis Bacon to Ottoman-era iconography and the artist James Reeve’s photographs of cities at night. All designers take from cultures and periods and artists foreign to their own experience, of course, but too often, their tributes feel costume-y, suggesting an invented passion rather than a real one. Van Noten’s borrowings are less literal than they are gestural — yes, the pieces in his fall 2012 collection were covered with stylized Chinese dragons and phoenixes (rendered in a vivid, imperial saffron), but they were pieced alongside shimmering stripes of vermilion and jade of the sort that adorn the canopies of tantric Buddhist temples in Nepal, and Japanese cranes stitched in gold and frozen in midflight. The difference between a designer and a copyist is that a designer makes his source material into something else, something his own; he doesn’t just present it, unchanged and unsynthesized, as work he’s created himself.

Curiously, it is in his wide-ranging eye, in his knowledge of textile and artistic traditions from the world’s great civilizations, that Van Noten announces himself as Flemish. Designers these days rarely work where they were born or became adults — to be in fashion now is to exchange actual citizenship for the parallel universe in which the industry operates, a universe consisting of Milan, Paris, London, New York and maybe Tokyo — and yet Van Noten, who is as well-traveled as any of his peers, continues to reside and work in Antwerp, where he was born, raised and educated. (His current estate, Ringenhof, an 1840s neo-Classical stone house built for a local beer brewer, is a peaceful 30-minute drive from the city center.) When Van Noten was a child, Antwerp was mostly a quiet, bourgeois town, and yet fashion, the idea of it, wasn’t an impossible concept for him. His father, himself descended from a family of tailors, owned several boutiques and made regular trips to Milan and Paris to buy polite, well-constructed Italian and French wares: shoes from Ferragamo, shirts from Charvet. As a teenager, Van Noten acted as the buyer for the children’s department. The stores would occasionally host Saturday-afternoon shows, local models spinning through the space while wearing the season’s new offerings. In making their lives in textiles, in fabrics, in goods from all the countries and cultures surrounding tiny Belgium, the family was following in the Lowlands’ centuries-long legacy of trade, joining the generations of burghers who let their fingertips trace over foreign silks and foreign wools, who measured foreign dyes and foreign powders. If you were a wealthy 13th-century merchant in Bruges, 60 miles west of Antwerp, you would, in a real way, spend your lifetime encountering patterns and colors from lands you could only imagine through their material goods; wonderment would be in your blood. To be Flemish — as Van Noten adamantly is — was to spend your life looking outward and beyond.

This perspective may explain in part why the arrival of the so-called Antwerp Six — a group of early ’80s graduates of the fashion school at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts that included Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester and Walter Van Beirendonck, who together mounted a now-legendary, semi-guerrilla-style show in London in 1986 — was more a surprise to the rest of the world than to the participants themselves. (Martin Margiela is a contemporary of the Antwerp Six, though he wasn’t part of that initial presentation.) Van Noten crossed into adulthood in the 1970s, in the early years of modern cultural globalization, when ideas and aesthetics and music and art traveled faster and farther than ever before in human history. You could be an adolescent in Antwerp and hear punk music from London or West Berlin, and suddenly you would understand that someone out there was creating something that you could be a part of, that you could participate in, that seemed to communicate directly to you. You were seeing images in magazines and on television of people your age or a little older or a little younger doing things that you too might be able to do, and it was transfixing, transformative. For Van Noten, that person was David Bowie, and years later, he paid homage to him — his narrow, bladelike suits, his languor and loucheness — again and again. And it wasn’t just in fashion: All over, in countries both free and not, young people were realizing that what might unite them wasn’t family or heritage or nation, it was music or art or theater or film. They were creating the new wave, the avant-garde, but they had begun doing so as a way of seeking some sort of greater connection — as a way to reach somebody else.

AFTER THE LONDON SHOW, Van Noten returned home and started selling. He had begun his business in men’s wear, and one of his first (and most enduring) clients, Barneys New York, had simply bought the smallest sizes from his collection and sold them as women’s wear. Three years later, in 1989, he moved his small boutique into a five-floor former department store in a run-down section of town and began in earnest the business of being a fashion designer.

He never stopped. Absent from Van Noten’s three-decade career are stories of bankruptcy, strife, irresponsibility, overleverage, overexpansion, overspending or unhinged, dangerous effulgence. He worked slowly and carefully; he did only what he wanted to, when he wanted to. Along the way, there were challenges (global recessions, a luxury market that grew ever more fickle, trends and fads and gimmicks to withstand) and triumphs: a women’s boutique in Paris in 2007; a second in Tokyo and a men’s wear boutique in Paris in 2009; a sumptuous exhibition, “Inspirations,” one of the few granted to a living designer, at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs in 2014. But what remained constant was Van Noten’s discipline, his aversion to self-indulgence, to folly, his adherence to a rigor that announces itself in his designs and in his conduct: a sense of discipline that, paradoxically, has earned him extraordinary artistic freedom. He has to make compromises — every creative person does, in one way or another — but he rarely has to make concessions. Today, he controls every element of his business. (He collaborates on the line’s shoes with a manufacturer.) He will tell you, without apology, that he wants his clothes to sell; that he makes his clothes to sell. His business, its longevity and health, is a reminder that one of the most seductive fictions of fashion is that it exists as a pure aesthetic expression — and yet those who believe this are those who disappear after a year or five, comets whose tails fade quickly into the glittering black.

A visit to Van Noten’s offices, now headquartered in a 60,000-square-foot, six-floor waterfront warehouse, recalls in many ways a visit to his gardens: Here is Van Noten’s other world, or a continuation of it, the place where he executes those ideas, those images, those strange colors he imagines while strolling among Ringenhof’s hollyhocks and smoke trees. If you begin at the top floor showroom and work downward, you can see the entire operation unfold before you, from the design team’s desks, some fitted with a little cabinet stuffed with scraps of deliciously colored swatches of silks, jacquards, wools, jerseys and cottons, and continuing down through the financial department, the sales department, the production and distribution departments and the archives. But it is the ground floor — the shipping department — that is somehow both the most moving and most impressive. When I visited, the first deliveries of the fall collection were arriving. Each garment is sorted, inspected and then boxed. Van Noten wandered through the maze of boxes — stacked several high, almost scraping the ceilings — pointing out which was going to Moscow, which to Hong Kong, which to Singapore, which to New York; along with eight boutiques, the collection is sold in more than 400 stores worldwide. He appeared, in those moments, a touch bewildered — or maybe simply awe-struck. It was a Willy Wonka kind of fantasy, to stand in a building in your hometown among hundreds of cartons packed with things you had dreamed up, all of them destined for places that you might never have imagined visiting as a child growing up not far from here, but now would be worn by people you would never meet in lands your ancestors would never have been able to see for themselves.

By now it was time for lunch, which would be served in the studio. Back upstairs we entered a high-ceilinged, near-empty room, where the page proofs of one of the designer’s upcoming books, a career survey, were laid on the ground. Last March, in Paris, Van Noten mounted his hundredth show, a joyous anthology of his signature, most Dries-like patterns and textures from across the years, many worn by some of his earliest models, now mostly in their late 40s. It was a reminder of the totality, the singularity of his vision, of how each season is in conversation with the last, of how, when you see a Dries Van Noten collection, you are seeing the latest installment in the sartorial equivalent of what the novelist David Mitchell calls an “über-book”: All of his works (in Mitchell’s case, fiction; in Van Noten’s case, fashion) are part of some grander mosaic that is visible only to its creator, and yet, equally, are revealing of some invisible part of its creator’s mind. This is why you can wear a Dries Van Noten dress or shift or skirt from any season at anytime, and although fellow members of the Van Noten tribe will recognize it as his, it will always look relevant, and surprising — a chapter in a book you love, but not one that is immediately nameable.

Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows. Here was the Turkish-inflected fall 2006 collection, with its patterns of Mughal-esque tulips, blown up exaggeratedly large, and the India-inspired fall 1996 show with its translucent, shocking chartreuse blouses and fragile, sparkling, sari-like column skirts. Together, we ambled up one row and then down another, looking at the photos at our feet, bursts of color against the cool cement. I asked him the lazy question you should never ask any artist — did he have a favorite look, a favorite show? — and he, like most artists, demurred. But then he corrected himself: Most of the collections were represented by only six pages, he said; if he really liked them, he might have devoted eight to them, or 10, or even 14. Once again, we began to move, counting the pages, calling out to each other — 10! 12! — and pausing at particularly striking works: a chiffon and burnt velvet caftan, a men’s coat so heavy with embroidery it resembled armor. If every life is a collection of images, too many to process and too many to remember, then this book was, in a real way, his life, or part of it, anyway: a beautiful life, one perfect in its wholeness and conception. To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?

We stopped before a picture of one of my favorite dresses, a gently draped silk sheath, its top a pattern of slashy lilac dashes against a bark-colored background; its bottom an almost Impressionistic blur of blue irises. I remembered this collection, this piece: It was from spring 2008, and I didn’t have the money to buy it. I would go to the store and try it on, and then I would have to leave it behind.

“This is one of the most gorgeous things I’ve seen,” I said.

Artists, no matter how well they might learn to project otherwise, are rarely humble people. Or rather, they are and they aren’t — to be an artist is, often, to live in the thin, unhappy space between arrogance and self-hatred, with one word tipping you over the line in one direction or another. Maybe that’s not the case for Van Noten, who doesn’t brag, doesn’t boast. But for a few seconds, he didn’t speak. His handsome face twitched into a suggestion of a frown. He stared at the dress as he’d stared at that rose, that rose that had so surprised him.

“A beautiful dress,” I repeated. He continued looking at the picture of that dress on the ground before us, something so lovely — the dull shimmer of the silk, the Dries Van Noten blue of the flowers — that not even he could claim otherwise. Sometimes, even the Depressed Gardener’s only move is to surrender to the enchantment of the thing before him.

MONDAY PUZZLE — If you believe The Doctor — and please don’t ask me which one — time is not a linear progression the way we Earthlings experience it. Rather, it is a big ball of “wibbly wobbly, timey wimey stuff.”

So it’s not surprising that we humans are unable to make something like time or the marking of time bend to our collective wills. For centuries, different countries used different calendars, and even the old Julian calendar had its problems.

That is why, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered that everyone stop messing around and use one calendar. Even then, the later a country switched over, the more days had to be dropped in order to stay in sync with the vernal equinox and the winter solstice. This resulted in a lot of confusion for a while, including the month of September 1752 in North America, which looked like this and which children across the continent still whisper about as “The Best Start to the School Year Ever.”

When it first debuted in the spring of 2011, ABC’s “Happy Endings” tried too hard to copy the relationship melodrama and cheery “hangout” comedy of “Friends.” Once the sitcom found its own quirky energy and sense of humor, though (about a third of the way through Season 1), it kept its too-few fans satisfied for more than 50 priceless episodes.

Why do more efficient cars create jobs? Because consumers plow their savings at the gas pump back into the economy, creating jobs in sectors like retail and construction that generate far more jobs per consumer dollar spent than the oil extraction industry. And in an increasingly globalized and increasingly climate-conscious world, cleaner cars will keep America’s auto manufacturers competitive.

Federal agencies spent years conducting a rigorous “midterm” review that included research by experts at E.P.A. labs, technical analysis from experts across academia and input from a wide range of stakeholders, including automakers. This in-depth analysis shows, conclusively, that automakers can improve efficiency — and, thanks to technological innovation, they can do it at lower cost than federal agencies anticipated when these standards were developed. That’s why the E.P.A. determined in January that the standards should stay in place — they’re technically and economically feasible.

Yet Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, has withdrawn that determination and seems ready to ignore years of scientific and economic analyses that underpinned the agency’s decision, and auto industry trade groups are taking advantage of this opening.

They are claiming that the standards are too hard to reach because consumers are more interested in larger vehicles like S.U.V.s and pickup trucks — but that’s at odds with how the standards actually work. Because the standards are based on the size of the vehicle, rather than an overall, across-the-board reduction target, they have the flexibility to adapt to changing consumer preferences. Whether drivers want a subcompact or an S.U.V., the standards make sure this year’s model runs cleaner and gets better mileage than last year’s.

Though we can’t count on today’s leaders at federal agencies to do the right thing and follow the facts, we can insist that automakers act responsibly, as they have before.

Starting in 2010, automakers worked together with federal agencies, the State of California and public interest groups to design these standards. So far, the automakers have kept their end of the bargain by building cleaner, more efficient cars across the board, from S.U.V.s to compacts, benefiting all consumers. They’ve also invested billions in electric cars. Consumers today enjoy many new options for high performance, longer-range electric vehicles, even as prices drop. Notably, automakers are benefiting from this innovation with record sales and job growth that contribute significantly to the country’s economic well-being.

But now is a moment of truth. The standards that have helped drive this progress are under threat, putting the country on a course to higher carbon dioxide emissions. If auto executives want their statements about climate change and their positive vision for the future to be taken seriously, they must ensure that their agents do not block this progress behind closed doors in Washington. Instead, they need to state clearly and publicly that they support these standards, oppose weakening them, and can and will build the cleaner, more efficient cars that fully comply with the standards.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

Vicki Eastus, a puzzle solver in Brooklyn, put it this way: “The more hectic life is, the more calming I find filling in those little boxes.”

Search the internet for research on the impact of puzzle-solving on the brain, and you’ll find plenty of studies. But the results are mixed, and it’s not clear whether puzzle solving has any purely physiological benefits.

The psychological benefits, though, are not in question.

“When you do a puzzle, the mind becomes completely absorbed in the task at hand,” said Joanne Cohen-Katz, a psychologist in Allentown, Pa. “There is total focus on what is happening in the moment, which is the definition of mindfulness. And we know that mindfulness results in all sorts of positive changes in the brain.”

For one, solving a crossword can be a path to serenity in a world of uncertainty.

“I don’t think I have to sell you on the increased demand for this type of pastime in an increasingly worried world,” wrote Margaret Farrar, the first crossword editor of The Times, in a memo to Lester Markel, the Sunday editor, after the Pearl Harbor attack. “You can’t think of your troubles while solving a crossword.”

In recent interviews, New York Times crossword enthusiasts shared their emotional connections to the pastime and described the value they find in the exercise.

Harry Hassell, of Jackson Heights, Queens, remembered his mother working on crosswords. “Amid the chaos of the household, it allowed her a personal pleasure and a routine all her own,” he said. “It also allowed me to see her not just as a car-pooling, tennis-playing mother, but also as a clever, intelligent, word-loving woman.”

Such intergenerational connections, forged over black-and-white grids, can have long-term implications.

“I first started doing crosswords as a child while visiting my Grandma Pat,” said Neil Padrick Wilson, a claims analyst in Tacoma, Wash. “She would sit at the big dining room table, dipping toast in her coffee. I would dip toast in my hot chocolate and we would work through a puzzle together. It got me to think, it got me to learn and it got me to know her better.”

Puzzles became so important to Mr. Wilson that he began to create them, and a crossword he made recently ran in The Times.

While not all enthusiasts go on to construct puzzles, it’s not uncommon for an early habit to persist.

“Rituals are often key in bonding with others, particularly family rituals,” said Ray Bepko, a clinical psychologist in Clinton, N.Y. “Pastimes and hobbies are very much a part of this and impact our adult relationships.”

That seems to be at least one reason people continue or develop a solving habit in adulthood, Dr. Bepko said. “Accessing this deep emotional connection is a source of comfort and reassurance anytime, particularly in difficult moments.”

Of course, puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun — especially in the addictive “aha!” moments that many solvers describe.

The world has seen powerful leaders use lying as a form of mass manipulation before.","According to James Murphy’s translation of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf”:

“In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.”

The text continues:

“It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.”

This demonstrates a precise understanding of human psychology, but also the dangerously manipulative nature that operates in the mind of a demon.

And yet, as many have noted, no person of sound reason or even cursory political awareness can read this and not be immediately struck by how similar this strategy of lying is to Donald Trump’s seeming strategy of lying: Tell a lie bigger than people think a lie can be, thereby forcing their brains to seek truth in it, or vest some faith in it, even after no proof can be found.

Trump is no Hitler, but the way he has manipulated the American people with outrageous lies, stacked one on top of the other, has an eerie historical resonance. Demagogy has a fixed design.

It should be mentioned that Vanity Fair reported in 1990 that Trump’s first wife, Ivana, “told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, ‘My New Order,’ which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed.” The magazine pointed out that “Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist.” (At the time, Trump said, “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.”)

Trump has found a way to couch the lies so that people believe they don’t emanate from him but pass through him. He is not a producer but a projector.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

One way he does this is by using caveats — “I was told,” “Lots of people are saying” — as shields.

Jenna Johnson of The Washington Post addressed this in June 2016, writing about Trump’s use of the phrase “a lot of people are saying”:

“Trump frequently couches his most controversial comments this way, which allows him to share a controversial idea, piece of tabloid gossip or conspiracy theory without technically embracing it. If the comment turns out to be popular, Trump will often drop the distancing qualifier — ‘people think’ or ‘some say.’ If the opposite happens, Trump can claim that he never said the thing he is accused of saying, equating it to retweeting someone else’s thoughts on Twitter.”

In August of 2016, Gregory Krieg and Jeff Simon came to a similar conclusion about Trump’s use of these phrases, pointing out on CNN:

“Trump has a habit of punctuating his more self-assured claims with the phrase ‘believe me.’ But when he wants space between himself and the words he is about to speak or tweet, he defers to other sources, relying on a rhetorical sleight.”

Just this week, Trump told the colossal lie that “President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls” to the families of fallen soldiers.

When called out about this lie, he quickly retreated to one of his shield phrases: “That’s what I was told.”

He even projects his own ignorance onto others with his lies. As Steve Benen pointed out in July on MSNBC.com, Trump’s “awkward process of discovery has, however, produced a phrase of underappreciated beauty: ‘A lot of people don’t know that.’ These seven words are Trump’s way of saying, ‘I just learned something new, and I’m going to assume others are as ignorant as I am.’ ”

This is not a simple fear of the truth; it is a weaponizing of untruth. It is the use of the lie to assault and subdue. It is Trump doing to political ends what Hitler did to more brutal ends: using mass deception as masterful propaganda.

Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the “president” of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror. It is an intentional self-blinding to avoid offending frail sensibilities.

I have neither time nor patience for such tiptoeing. I prefer the boot of truth to slam down to earth like thunder, no matter the shock of hearing its clap.

The world has seen powerful leaders use lying as a form of mass manipulation before. It is seeing it now, and it will no doubt see it again. History recycles. But the result doesn’t have to be — and hopefully never will be again — a holocaust. It can manifest as a multitude of other, lesser horrors, in both protocol and policy, including the corrosion and regression of country and culture.

That is the very real threat we are facing. Trump isn’t necessarily a direct threat to your life — unless of course you are being kept alive by health care that he keeps threatening, or if you’re in Puerto Rico reeling in the wake of two hurricanes — but he is very much a threat to your quality of life.

Miranda: Oh?

Sondheim: Then I want to share it with a collaborator. But no, I don’t get that excitement that you get out of it, presenting it to collaborators. First of all, I only really do it with a book writer. I don’t with a director. I just don’t want to call in a director till it’s ready to present, and that means me and my collaborator. But you know, Lapine8 was the first one who actually made me give him unfinished songs. I never give unfinished songs.

Miranda: Did you find that valuable?

Sondheim: No, not particularly, but it was valuable to him.

Miranda: Well, it’s like being naked.

Sondheim: Exactly, and I don’t really mind that as long as I wash myself.

Miranda: You’re gonna show up naked sometimes.

Sondheim: You’ve got to have somebody who’ll surprise you and, you know, it’s the old lesson, you’ve got to work on something dangerous. You have to work on something that makes you uncertain. Something that makes you doubt yourself.

Miranda: Talk a bit about that danger and uncertainty.

Sondheim: Well, because it stimulates you to do things you haven’t done before. The whole thing is if you know where you’re going, you’ve gone, as the poet says. And that’s death. That leads to stultified writing and stultified shows.

Miranda: Since “Hamilton,” I have been pitched every historical era.

Sondheim: Of course! And so that’s the one thing you don’t want to do. After “Gypsy” I got nothing but backstage stories and I said, “The only thing I don’t want to write is anything to do with show business.” That’s the only thing.

SONDHEIM HAS CERTAINLY followed his own advice in this regard: His choice of subject matter over the last half-century of work demolishes any notions of the kinds of stories musical theater can tell. From a violent barber (“Sweeney Todd” with Hugh Wheeler) to ancient Roman farce (1962’s “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,” with librettists Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart) to fractured fairy tales (“Into the Woods” with James Lapine). Within this vast terrain, he and his collaborators have also radically experimented with the musical theater form: See the diptych structure of “Sunday in the Park With George,” also with Lapine, in which each act takes place a century apart, or the unprecedented “Company” (1970), with a book by George Furth, a meditation on commitment and monogamy, which Sondheim describes as a “non-plot” musical.” Here he is, arriving at the form of “Follies,” his legendary 1971 musical with librettist James Goldman about a reunion of retired performers from a 1930s Ziegfeldesque revue: “You start with the subject matter and some content and it takes form. If you’re going to say, ‘O.K., it’s a reunion party,’ well, hello, don’t try to give it a plot. And if you don’t give it a plot, what’s going to hold it together? Uh-oh. That’s what’s dangerous and that’s what’s scary about it.”

We gravitate toward the subject of surprise, both for the audience and for the playwright.

Sondheim: That was a big lesson from Peter Shaffer.9 We went to see a play once about the mad queen of Spain and in the first act there were two rapes, an evisceration, a fire and something horrifying with a child, I don’t remember. And at the end of the first act I said, “This is so much my kind of thing. Why am I bored?” He said, “There’s no surprise.” And I thought, “Put that on your bathroom mirror.” Surprise: if it’s in the lyric, the unexpected word, the unexpected note, the unexpected incident. The unexpected, the unexpected, that’s what theater is about. If you had to patent one thing in the theater, it’s surprise.

Miranda: Can you think of any times you’ve surprised yourself in the writing process?

Sondheim: Oh, come on, as a writer you’re always surprised when you think of the right note or the right word. You think, “Oh, I didn’t know I could — oh, that’s good!” You know, writing’s full of surprises for oneself. It comes with the territory, but this is a different kind of thing. This is surprising the audience —

Sondheim bats the question away. He’s either uninterested in recounting a specific time that he surprised himself while writing, or there have been so many that it’s impossible to pick: It comes with the territory.

Video

Two years ago, I interviewed Sondheim and John Weidman together for a PBS documentary, but my favorite moment from the interview never aired. We were on the subject of “Finishing the Hat” from “Sunday in the Park With George,” one of Sondheim’s most celebrated songs, and maybe the greatest song ever written about the self-induced spell of the creative process.10 In this excerpt from that interview, just as in his work, Sondheim’s collaborator brought out the best in him:

Weidman: Do you remember you called me the night you finished that song?

Sondheim (smiling): Was I excited?

Weidman: You were ... beyond excited. I mean, it’s like you needed to call somebody. I may have been number 17 on the list, but I could hear it in your voice, you said, “I just wrote this song.”

Sondheim: Yeah, I remember, I wanted to tell everybody. [Laughs.] I wanted to tell everybody. I was really pleased.

Miranda: I love the story you told about the making of it in your book, about being inspired by a party game you were creating for Phyllis Newman’s party,11 and realizing you’d spent the entire night in a sort of trance —

Sondheim: I started planning that game at 8 o’clock in the evening, and when I looked up, it was 7 o’clock in the morning. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. Time had disappeared. That’s what happens — you must know that yourself. You must know that the great thing about writing and creating is, time disappears. You are in the moment, and the moment can go for eight hours or for two minutes, or whatever, until the phone rings, or you know, you have to go get something to eat.

PRESENT DAY again — I’m trying to give Sondheim credit for expanding the scope of the American musical, and he is passing on the credit to his mentor Oscar Hammerstein instead.

Miranda: Something that’s so essential about your work is that I think you have expanded the terrain of what musical theater can be. The notion of, “This is a musical, that’s not a musical,” is BS. It’s carried entirely by the passion of the creators.

Sondheim: Yeah, but Oscar invented that with “Oklahoma!” He took a play that was about homosexuality in the West and turned it into a sunny musical. Because he saw something in it that was beyond what Lynn Riggs12 had written, about the opening of territories, the promise of America. He saw that which anybody else reading that play would not have seen.

Miranda: O.K. But it gets back to the notion of, “If I can find myself in the work, others will see themselves.” So it’s about not being afraid of specificity.

Sondheim lights up.

Photo

Sondheim: Absolutely! That’s exactly what he taught me, when he criticized my poetic Hammerstein lyrics when I was starting out.13 He said, “That’s not what you feel. Don’t write what I feel. Write what you feel.” Oh! It had never occurred to me to write what I felt. And Oscar was the one who taught everyone to do that.

Write what you feel. Or as George’s muse, Dot, says to him in “Sunday,” “Anything you do,/Let it come from you./Then it will be new.”

And then for a moment you let in the depth and intensity and range of Stephen Sondheim’s feeling for the past half-century. That Tony and Maria of “West Side Story” first fell in love as Sondheim sharpened his Blackwing pencils, finding the words for their doomed romance at age 25. That Mrs. Lovett of “Sweeney Todd” hatched her diabolical plans from this writing couch as Sondheim talked to himself. That within Sondheim, somewhere, is both Georges Seurat and Fosca, Pseudolus and Mama Rose, John Wilkes Booth and Madame Armfeldt, Charley Kringas and Little Red Riding Hood. He has served up vodka stingers for Joanne (“Company”) and chrysanthemum tea for the Shogun (“Pacific Overtures”). Sixty years of iconic theatrical moments, and they exist as a result of the specific way Stephen Sondheim feels. Line by line, note by note, surprise by surprise.

And if you’re Sondheim, there are days like today, when you feel under the weather and the day is full of distractions. But there are also nights when you write “Finishing the Hat,” and you’re so proud of what you’ve made that you have to call a friend and say, “I just wrote this song.”

What’s important is that Sondheim is still here, staring down another deadline. Starting on a hat. Feeling his way toward the moment when time disappears.

Sondheim: You shouldn’t feel safe. You should feel, “I don’t know if I can write this.” That’s what I mean by dangerous, and I think that’s a good thing to do. Sacrifice something safe.

“If, like me, you love your local neighborhood stores, your bakeries, your cafes, your clothing stores, all these things, then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,” he said, to applause from the audience in northwest Brooklyn.

“A lot of this is economic and consumer-choice-based,” Mr. de Blasio said, shortly after his administration released a raft of documents, including a letter from the mayor, outlining why Amazon should base its operations in the five boroughs. “So a lot of people are turning to Amazon and other online options, that’s one of the underlying factors.”

Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group that supported the city’s Amazon bid, said the mayor’s comments looked to be at odds with the city’s public courting of the retailer.

“When the mayor sends this kind of mixed message, it appears that he does not think his words matter,” she said.

A spokesman for Starbucks pointed to the roughly 8,000 people employed by the company in New York City and the benefits they receive, including health coverage, and to efforts like a voting drive in Jamaica, Queens, and hosting meetings between police officers and New Yorkers in its coffee shops.

“We welcome the mayor to join us for any of these happening regularly in his hometown,” the spokesman, Reggie Borges, said in an email.

The mayor, as well as his aides and supporters, have defended Mr. de Blasio’s stances as a reflection of his true self, and say that anything else would be pandering or false. Some find his honesty — especially when it comes to the Yankees, who can cause headaches for many New Yorkers — to be refreshing in a politician.

“I’m not going to fake anything,” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday at an unrelated news conference. “I’m going to be myself. They’ll have their games and if they win in the end, we will honor them.”

When the mayor adamantly told reporters at the outdoor event that he would not attend a game if the Yankees made it to the World Series, a fan standing nearby shouted: “The city takes precedence!”

After the news conference, the fan, Jerry Urcivoli, 45, said he was aghast that the mayor would put his loyalty to the Red Sox ahead of his role as mayor.

“You don’t put that aside and say, ‘That’s my personal belief and I should go as a representative of Manhattan and New York City’?” Mr. Urcivoli said. “It’s disgraceful the mayor’s not going.”

It did seem only recently that Mr. de Blasio was open to finally checking off a few boxes on his personal mayoral to-do list.

Last month, the mayor attended the opening night gala at the Metropolitan Opera, where “Norma” was performed. It was his first visit to that event. The next day, he visited the High Line for the first time.

But with polls showing him with a 44 percentage point lead over his closest challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican assemblywoman, Mr. de Blasio seems to be digging in again.

“I am a crazed, rabid baseball fan and Red Sox fan,” Mr. de Blasio told The Daily News editorial board on Tuesday. “It is constitutionally impossible to quote unquote root for the New York Yankees.”

It may also speak to both the nature of fandom and to the particularities of his deep devotion to the home team of Boston, where Mr. de Blasio grew up.

“Expectations would be that even when people move to new environments they tend to pick up the allegiance of the team,” said Edward R. Hirt, a professor of psychology at Indiana University in Bloomington, who studies sports fandom and social identity. “If you were the mayor of that community and wanting to build community spirit you’d want to be seen as identifying with that.”

“It is seemingly a head-scratcher,” he added.

Mr. de Blasio’s challengers in the mayoral race were less confused.

“Unconscionable,” Ms. Malliotakis told reporters Thursday.

“If you don’t like the Yankees, you don’t like being in New York,” said Bo Dietl, an independent candidate for mayor who attended Wednesday night’s game, seated behind home plate. “He should not be the mayor of this great city. It just shows his narcissism.”

As for Amazon, Mr. Dietl said he does not use the site, a rare point of harmony with Mr. de Blasio. “I like touchy-feely. I like to go to a store and look at what I’m going to buy,” he said.

Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant and Mets fan, said that past mayors have been rabid in their New York fandom — as Rudolph W. Giuliani was for the Yankees — or uninterested in sports and supportive of the local team, as was the case with Ed Koch and with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Boston native who grew up a Red Sox fan but rooted for the Yankees against his childhood team as mayor.

“As a baseball fan who also doesn’t like the Yankees, I’m following it with interest,” Mr. Skurnik said.

In theory, lawmakers are supposed to pass an annual budget resolution to provide a blueprint for federal spending and revenues. The document is not signed by the president and does not hold the force of law, but it is an important step in what, in theory, should be an orderly annual budget process.

But in a development that has shocked no one on Capitol Hill, this year’s budget process, for the 2018 fiscal year that began Oct. 1, has not proceeded with any great efficiency.

Congress is supposed to adopt a budget resolution by April 15, giving the House and Senate Appropriations Committees plenty of time to proceed with their work on spending bills before the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.

Instead, the Senate is moving on a budget for a fiscal year that has already begun.

“Look at the date,” Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and a member of the Budget Committee, said on Wednesday.

“We are debating a budget for fiscal year 2018 months too late and more than two weeks into the fiscal year we are supposed to be budgeting for,” Ms. Murray noted.

Senators are not even pretending that plotting out the government’s finances is the task at hand, even after the budget deficit reached an estimated $668 billion in the fiscal year that just ended, up $82 billion from the year before.

“Let’s be candid about what this is about,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania and a member of the Budget Committee. “The budget resolution is about giving us the tool to later this year pass tax reform.”

In other words, the budget is not really about the budget.

“It’s a misnomer,” Mr. Toomey said.

In fact, as senators debated the budget resolution this week, they have focused on the merits of the coming tax bill, not spending levels and programs to fund and defund.

In that sense, it has been a legislative debate about legislation that does not yet exist. But that has not tamped down the strong feelings among Republicans and Democrats alike, with Republicans expressing great hopes of powerful economic growth and Democrats warning against providing tax cuts to the rich.

Before the budget is approved, the Senate will undertake a tedious ritual known as a “vote-a-rama,” in which senators can offer an endless series of amendments.

The vote-a-rama provides the minority party with a chance to force the majority to take politically uncomfortable votes. As Republicans lay the groundwork for their tax bill, Democrats plan to extract as much political pain as they can.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the amendments proposed by Democrats this week would shine a light on the Republican tax plan.

“The more people see of this tax bill, the less they will like it,” he said.

The Senate’s budget document will still need to be reconciled with the House’s blueprint, which lawmakers in that chamber approved Oct. 5.

In the meantime, Republican senators are not urging anyone to pick up the budget blueprint if they are in need of reading material.

“Every budget that’s put out by either side of the aisle is a total joke,” Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, observed recently. “It’s not worth the paper that it’s written on.”

The appearance came after Mr. Trump and the White House were consumed by criticism after the president’s actions this week — first appearing to criticize former presidents for failing to call the families of fallen service members and later for the words Mr. Trump chose to use in speaking with the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson.

Mr. Kelly defended Mr. Trump by offering a detailed, even excruciating description of what happens to those killed in combat, including how the remains are packed in ice for the flights back to the United States. He testified to the deep pain that parents feel when they get an early-morning knock on the door from an official there to tell them that their son or daughter has been killed in action.

“The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

He said that presidents often are not among those who call family members directly, and he confirmed what Mr. Trump had alluded to publicly this week: that former President Barack Obama had not called him after Lieutenant Kelly was killed.

“That was not a criticism, that was simply to say I don’t believe President Obama called,” Mr. Kelly said, adding that President George W. Bush and other presidents did not always make personal phone calls to family members. He said Lieutenant Kelly’s friends in Afghanistan called him in the hours after his son died.

“Those were the only phone calls that really matter,” Mr. Kelly said. “Yeah, the letters count to a degree. But there’s not much that can take the edge off.”

The controversy over Mr. Trump’s remarks began even before he made the calls to the families, when former Obama administration officials took offense at the suggestion that Mr. Obama had not done as much as Mr. Trump to pay honor to the fallen.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump did not intend that to be a criticism of his predecessor, but rather was repeating what Mr. Kelly had briefed him on before he got the question at an impromptu news conference on Monday in the Rose Garden.

Mr. Kelly expressed frustration and even anger at the fact that the conversation between Mr. Trump and Sergeant Johnson’s widow was exposed to the world by Ms. Wilson, a friend of the family, who was in the car with the family when the president’s call came in.

“I thought at least that was sacred,” Mr. Kelly said, expressing dismay at other aspects of society that were no longer sacred, including women, religion and Gold Star families.

Ms. Wilson had publicized her criticism of Mr. Trump’s call, saying that the president had told Sergeant Johnson’s widow that he “knew what he signed up for,” and that the family was offended by Mr. Trump’s words.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had tried, in the call, to express what Mr. Kelly had talked to him about ahead of time — that people like her husband were doing what they loved, and what they had chosen to do, when they were killed serving the country.

“That’s what the president tried to say to four families,” Mr. Kelly said.

Mr. Kelly said that he was so upset on Wednesday that he went to the cemetery to walk among the service members who had died fighting for the country.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

I smiled again and said that I wouldn’t. He gave up and called me stubborn. I said, “I know.” And the meal proceeded without much further ado. In this second encounter with Harvey, I found him to be pushy and idiosyncratic more than anything.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

The Weinstein Investigation

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html

Many of you don’t know anyone who knows any one of them.
You know, there’s thousands.
GENERAL KELLY: First of all, that’s a — you know, we are at the highest level of the U.S. government.
I know they’re conducting an investigation.","So that’s the process. While that’s happening, a casualty officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom and dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different places. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until — well, for a long, long time, even after the internment. So that’s what happens.

Who are these young men and women? They are the best 1 percent this country produces. Most of you, as Americans, don’t know them. Many of you don’t know anyone who knows any one of them. But they are the very best this country produces, and they volunteer to protect our country when there’s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate, but required. But that’s all right.

Who writes letters to the families? Typically, the company commander — in my case, as a Marine — the company commander, battalion commander, regimental commander, division commander, Secretary of Defense, typically the service chief, commandant of the Marine Corps, and the President typically writes a letter.

Typically, the only phone calls a family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies. In my case, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan, telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really mattered.

And yeah, the letters count, to a degree, but there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.

So some Presidents have elected to call. All Presidents, I believe, have elected to send letters. If you elect to call a family like this, it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. There’s no perfect way to make that phone call.

When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, my first recommendation was he not do it because it’s not the phone call that parents, family members are looking forward to. It’s nice to do, in my opinion, in any event.

He asked me about previous Presidents, and I said, I can tell you that President Obama, who was my Commander-in-Chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family. That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say, I don’t believe President Obama called. That’s not a negative thing. I don’t believe President Bush called in all cases. I don’t believe any President, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high — that Presidents call. But I believe they all write.

So when I gave that explanation to our President three days ago, he elected to make phone calls in the cases of four young men who we lost in Niger at the earlier part of this month. But then he said, how do you make these calls? If you’re not in the family, if you’ve never worn the uniform, if you’ve never been in combat, you can’t even imagine how to make that call. I think he very bravely does make those calls.

The call in question that he made yesterday — or day before yesterday now — were to four family members, the four fallen. And remember, there’s a next-of-kin designated by the individual. If he’s married, that’s typically the spouse. If he’s not married, that’s typically the parents unless the parents are divorced, and then he selects one of them. If he didn’t get along with his parents, he’ll select a sibling. But the point is, the phone call is made to the next-of-kin only if the next-of-kin agrees to take the phone call. Sometimes they don’t.

So a pre-call is made: The President of the United States or the commandant of the Marine Corps, or someone would like to call, will you accept the call? And typically, they all accept the call.

So he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could. And he said to me, what do I say? I said to him, sir, there’s nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families.

Well, let me tell you what I told him. Let me tell you what my best friend, Joe Dunford, told me — because he was my casualty officer. He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we’re at war. And when he died, in the four cases we’re talking about, Niger, and my son’s case in Afghanistan — when he died, he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.

That’s what the President tried to say to four families the other day. I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing. A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion — that he’s a brave man, a fallen hero, he knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. There’s no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be, with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.

That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted.

It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life — the dignity of life — is sacred. That’s gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well.

Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. But I just thought — the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred.

And when I listened to this woman and what she was saying, and what she was doing on TV, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth. And you can always find them because they’re in Arlington National Cemetery. I went over there for an hour-and-a-half, walked among the stones, some of whom I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.

I’ll end with this: In October — April, rather, of 2015, I was still on active duty, and I went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami. And it was dedicated to two men who were killed in a firefight in Miami against drug traffickers in 1986 — a guy by the name of Grogan and Duke. Grogan almost retired, 53 years old; Duke, I think less than a year on the job. (Editor’s note: The F.B.I. agent for which the building is named was named Jerry L. Dove, not Duke.)

Anyways, they got in a gunfight and they were killed. Three other FBI agents were there, were wounded, and now retired. So we go down — Jim Comey gave an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to those fallen men and to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve our country so well, and law enforcement so well.

There were family members there. Some of the children that were there were three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their lives.

And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money — the $20 million — to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned. Stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.

But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said, O.K., fine.

So I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America, that let’s not let this maybe last thing that’s held sacred in our society — a young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country — let’s try to somehow keep that sacred. But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.

So I’m willing to take a question or two on this topic. Let me ask you this: Is anyone here a Gold Star parent or sibling? Does anyone here know a Gold Star parent or sibling?

O.K., you get the question.

Q Well, thank you, General Kelly. First of all, we have a great deal of respect — Semper Fi — for everything that you’ve ever done. But if we could take this a bit further. Why were they in Niger? We were told they weren’t in armored vehicles and there was no air cover. So what are the specifics about this particular incident? And why were we there? And why are we there?

GENERAL KELLY: Well, I would start by saying there is an investigation. Let me back up and say, the fact of the matter is, young men and women that wear our uniform are deployed around the world and there are tens of thousands, near the DMZ in North Korea [sic], in Okinawa, waiting to go — in South Korea — in Okinawa, ready to go. All over the United States, training, ready to go. They’re all over Latin America. Down there, they do mostly drug and addiction, working with our partners — our great partners — the Colombians, the Central Americans, the Mexicans.

You know, there’s thousands. My own son, right now, back in the fight for his fifth tour against ISIS. There’s thousands of them in Europe acting as a deterrent. And they’re throughout Africa. And they’re doing the nation’s work there, and not making a lot of money, by the way, doing it. They love what they do.

So why were they there? They’re there working with partners, local — all across Africa — in this case, Niger — working with partners, teaching them how to be better soldiers; teaching them how to respect human rights; teaching them how to fight ISIS so that we don’t have to send our soldiers and Marines there in their thousands. That’s what they were doing there.

Now, there is an investigation. There’s always an — unless it’s a very, very conventional death in a conventional war, there’s always an investigation. Of course, that operation is conducted by AFRICOM that, of course, works directly for the Secretary of Defense.

There is a — and I talked to Jim Mattis this morning. I think he made statements this afternoon. There’s an investigation ongoing. An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll. The fact is they need to find out what happened and why it happened.

But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand that these young people — sometimes old guys — put on the uniform, go to where we send them to protect our country. Sometimes they go in large numbers to invade Iraq and invade Afghanistan. Sometimes they’re working in small units, working with our partners in Africa, Asia, Latin America, helping them be better.

But at the end of the day, they’re helping those partners be better at fighting ISIS in North Africa to protect our country so that we don’t have to send large numbers of troops.

Any other — someone who knows a Gold Star fallen person.

John?

Q General, thank you for being here today and thank you for your service and for your family’s sacrifice. There has been some talk about the timetable of the release of the statement about the — I think at that point it was three soldiers who were killed in Niger. Can you walk us through the timetable of the release of that information? And what part did the fact that a beacon was pinging during that time have to do with the release of the statement? And were you concerned that divulging information early might jeopardize the soldiers’ attempt to be (inaudible)?

GENERAL KELLY: First of all, that’s a — you know, we are at the highest level of the U.S. government. The people that will answer those questions will be the people at the other end of the military pyramid.

I’m sure the Special Forces group is conducting it. I know they’re conducting an investigation. That investigation, of course, under the auspices of AFRICOM, ultimately will go to the Pentagon. I’ve read the same stories you have. I actually know a lot more than I’m letting on, but I’m not going to tell you.

There is an investigation being done. But as I say, the men and women of our country that are serving all around the world — I mean, what the hell is my son doing back in the fight? He’s back in the fight because — working with Iraqi soldiers who are infinitely better than they were a few years ago to take ISIS on directly so that we don’t have to do it. Small numbers of Marines where he is working alongside those guys. That’s why they’re out there, whether it’s Niger, Iraq, or whatever. We don’t want to send tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines, in particular, to go fight.

I’ll take one more, but it’s got to be from someone who knows — all right.

Q General, when you talk about Niger, sir, what does your intelligence tell you about the Russian connection with them? And the stories that are coming out now, they’re —

GENERAL KELLY: I have no knowledge of any Russian connection, but I was not, in my position, to know that. That’s a question for NORTHCOM or for — not NORTHCOM — for AFRICOM or DOD.

Thanks very much, everybody.

As I walk off the stage, understand there’s tens of thousands of American kids, mostly, doing their nation’s bidding all around the world. They don’t have to be in uniform. You know, when I was a kid, every man in my life was a veteran — World War II, Korea, and there was the draft. These young people today, they don’t do it for any other reason than their selfless — sense of selfless devotion to this great nation.

We don’t look down upon those of you who that haven’t served. In fact, in a way we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll have never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kinds of things our service men and women do — not for any other reason than they love this country. So just think of that.

And I do appreciate your time. Take care.",Full Transcript and Video: Kelly Defends Trump’s Handling of Soldier’s Death and Call to Widow,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/statement-kelly-gold-star.html

Even before the disastrous imposition of collective farming, Russia’s new rulers “once again followed the precedent set by the czars,” Applebaum writes; “they banned Ukrainian newspapers, stopped the use of Ukrainian in schools and shut down Ukrainian theaters.” By the mid-1920s, once Soviet power had been firmly established, the regime tried a new policy, as it did in other non-Russian parts of the Soviet Union, giving official status to the Ukrainian language and allowing the production of a definitive Ukrainian-Russian dictionary.

But rather than making the Ukrainians into happy Soviets, this period of limited tolerance only produced more demands for Ukrainian-language schools for the nearly eight million ethnic Ukrainians living in Russia itself, and for Ukrainian border expansions to include some of those ethnic communities. An alarmed Kremlin quickly reversed course.

The end of the 1920s saw a crackdown on the Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox Church and arrests of tens of thousands of Ukrainian teachers and intellectuals — 45 of whom were the subject of a show trial at the Kharkiv Opera House. Thousands of Ukrainian books were removed from schools and libraries. The dictionary project was now judged subversive, and many of those who worked on it were arrested and shot. Ukrainian-language newspapers and magazines were given lists of words not to be used, and replacements closer to Russian. One letter was even removed from Ukrainian Cyrillic, to make it more like the Russian, as if the very alphabet were guilty of treason and had to be punished.

Then came the senseless scheme of compelling some of the Soviet Union’s most productive farmers to abandon their land and move to the untried new collectives. Not only was this imposing an ideological blueprint that didn’t work; it was carried out with a cruelty that guaranteed millions of people in the ethnically Ukrainian rural areas would starve. Peasant families were allowed to keep no food for themselves: Teams of Communist Party activists ripped up floorboards and poked through haylofts with iron rods, confiscating all they found, including grain being kept as seed for the next year’s crop. Despite the rotting, emaciated corpses of starved adults and children piling up along streets and highways and the wolves that took over abandoned farmhouses, the seizures continued, in part to find grain the state could sell abroad for hard currency. When even loyal party officials raised objections, they were fired, jailed or shot. If resistance to the requisitions and to collectivization was not stamped out, Stalin wrote to Lazar Kaganovich, one of his henchmen, in 1932, “we may lose Ukraine.”

The planned starvation, the execution of the territory’s best artists and intellectuals, the destruction of churches and the crushing of traditional village culture terrified into silence any Ukrainians who wanted autonomy or independence. Then finally, 60 years later, what Stalin had feared happened virtually overnight, and Russia did lose Ukraine. The history of all that happened between these two tragically intertwined peoples in the early 20th century fills in the background to Putin’s ruthless desire to gain influence or control over Ukraine once again.

Applebaum has painstakingly mined a vast array of sources, many of which were not available when the historian Robert Conquest wrote his pioneering history of the famine, “The Harvest of Sorrow,” 30 years ago: oral histories of survivors; national and local archives in Ukraine, including those of the secret police; and archives in Russia, which opened in the 1990s and then partly closed again, but not before various scholars published collections of documents from them.

One account of the famine comes from the young Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, who walked 40 miles through starvation-ridden districts in 1933 and, after he left the country, wrote one of the very few eyewitness descriptions of the carnage to appear in the Western press. Jones has been celebrated before, but Applebaum also tells the less known story of how, after he spoke out, Stalin’s government successfully strong-armed British and American correspondents in Moscow into denying what he said — even though some of them had been his sources, telling him what would have been censored from their own dispatches. It is a reminder of the lengths that demagogues will go to in order to suppress or distort the truth — something no less a problem in many a country today than it was in the Soviet Union more than eight decades ago.",Stalinist Crimes in Ukraine That Resonate Today,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/books/review/red-famine-stalin-ukraine-anne-applebaum.html

The incidence of mouth and throat cancers caused by the human papillomavirus in men has now surpassed the incidence of HPV-related cervical cancers in women, researchers report.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that 11 million men and 3.2 million women in the United States had oral HPV infections. Among them, 7 million men and 1.4 million women had strains that can cause cancers of the throat, tongue and other areas of the head and neck.

The risk of infection was higher for smokers, for people who have had multiple sex partners, and for men who have sex with men. Frequent oral sex also increased the risk. The rate was higher among men who also had genital HPV. (Almost half of men aged 18 to 60 have a genital HPV infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

Neither age nor income made a difference in high-risk oral infection rates, but rates among non-Hispanic blacks were higher than other races and ethnicities.

HPV vaccination is recommended starting at age 11 or 12 and is effective, said the senior author, Ashish A. Deshmukh, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, and “it’s crucial that parents vaccinate boys as well as girls.”

The lead author, Kalyani Sonawane, also at the University of Florida, said that behavioral change is important, too, particularly smoking cessation. “The difference in oral HPV infection between smokers and nonsmokers is staggering,” she said.",7 Million American Men Carry Cancer-Causing HPV,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/well/live/7-million-american-men-carry-cancer-causing-hpv-virus.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I mean, I’ve been working at a steady clip pretty much since I came to New York,” Ms. Myers said. “I never really had any downtime to speak of.”

Over the course of the evening at least a hundred guests, including Hal Rubenstein (the former fashion director of InStyle), Cindi Leive (the former editor in chief of Glamour) and many Elle staffers past and present, crowded the apartment, which was warmly lit and lined with walls of books.

The intellectual setting seemed appropriate; Ms. Myers encouraged introspective and journalistic work from her writers, including essays about abortion, political and cultural profiles, and an extensively reported piece about a murder abetted by social media.

In 2014, she wrote a scathing response to a New Republic story that questioned whether women’s magazines could do serious journalism.

Along with the departures of Ms. Leive, Graydon Carter and Nancy Gibbs, Ms. Myers’s seemed to signify the end of an era in glossy magazines. But this evening felt more specifically like an elegy — Elle-gy? — for a thoughtful time in women’s monthlies, before the incursions of Instagram and other digital media.

“I always thought Elle was different in that it let you write dense, crunchy, textured stories in an age where everything is quick,” said Ms. Merkin, who most recently wrote for Elle about considering a same-sex romantic relationship. “And I always admired Robbie for standing firm for that kind of piece.”

“I hope that what separated Elle out from the other magazines will be preserved,” Ms. Merkin said. “But I don’t know if that’s the very thing that’s going to be preserved.”

Also present was Anne Slowey, Elle’s longtime fashion director (she left in February, after 18 years), who has known Ms. Myers since the early 1980s and was once on a competitive swim team with her.

“The thing that saddens me about this year in particular is about the Women in Hollywood event,” Ms. Slowey said, referring to Elle’s 24th annual event celebrating women in the entertainment industry, which was held on Oct. 16 in Beverly Hills. After the accusations against Harvey Weinstein, actresses including Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Lawrence and Laura Dern delivered an outpouring of personal stories about sexual assault and harassment.

“I was particularly saddened that Robbie wasn’t there to receive credit at this moment when it could represent something more important,” Ms. Slowey, now a self-described “soccer mom” of two, said, before leaving to join her family dogs, Edie and Maude, waiting for her in a 1991 Volvo stuffed with groceries.

Back Story

“When something outrages you,” he wrote, “as Nazism did me, that is when you become a militant, strong and engaged.”

Born on this day in 1917, Stéphane Hessel, a French Resistance hero and Holocaust survivor, became an unlikely publishing phenomenon in 2011 at the age of 93, topping best-seller lists with “Indignez-Vous!”

At only about 4,000 words, “Indignez-Vous!” (“Time for Outrage!”) was more of a pamphlet. But it resonated with French readers who were gearing up for a presidential election, and those abroad who were protesting the eurozone crisis, participating in the Arab Spring uprisings and occupying Wall Street.

Mr. Hessel, above, urged young people to revive the spirit of the resistance by peacefully protesting the financial markets, France’s treatment of illegal immigrants, the influence of the rich on the news media and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

“Indignez-Vous!” sold more than three million copies in Europe in less than a year and was translated into more than a dozen languages. (The Nation magazine published the full text in English.)

Mr. Hessel died in 2013, but his call to outrage endures: “You join the movement of history,” he wrote, “and the great current of history continues to flow only thanks to each and every one of us.”

Until recently, Kenya’s Diani Beach was a well-kept secret for a cultured international crowd that has been vacationing on the coast since the 1970s, fueled by a passion for the sparkling white-gold beaches, rare sea safaris and luxury hotel scene that characterizes this strip of coastline on the Indian Ocean . But with the arrival of new dining, shopping and drinking spots, and a celebrity following, Diani Beach is now the trendy escape for tourists looking for respite after safari trips in the Samburu and Maasai regions. At only an hour’s domestic flight away from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, the golden stretch of beach is becoming one of the most popular sun, sea and sand destinations in the country.

Ali Barbour’s Cave Restaurant

Founded in the late 1970s and rediscovered by travelers, this seafood spot is in a cave believed to be between 120,000 and 180,000 years old. Its candlelit tables are dotted across a subterranean warren of small caves. A cocktail bar carved from stone makes this the perfect spot for an aperitif.

When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.
He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

Photo

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Photo

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

But advisers said the younger Mr. Bush has been deeply troubled by the state of the national debate under a president who routinely demonizes his adversaries on Twitter.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry and compromises the moral education of children,” Mr. Bush said in his speech. “The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them.”

Mr. Bush, who issued a statement with his father condemning white supremacists after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August, returned to the theme. “Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,” he said.

Along with the conference, the president released a paper examining threats to the liberal democratic order and making recommendations for protecting and strengthening American institutions. The paper was drafted by Peter H. Wehner, a former adviser in Mr. Bush’s White House, and Thomas O. Melia, a former State Department official under President Barack Obama.

The conference also featured a panel with two former secretaries of state, Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine K. Albright, joining Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Ms. Rice, who served under Mr. Bush, and Ms. Albright, who served under President Bill Clinton, seemed to gently coach Ms. Haley, urging the Trump administration to rethink its cuts to the State Department budget and its approach to the United Nations, to protect rather than attack the news media and to make a stronger response to Russian meddling in last year’s election.

Ms. Albright said the disparity between the Pentagon and State Department budgets was “crazy” and deprived the president of necessary resources. “We do not have a lot of tools,” she said. “It is necessary to have a functioning diplomatic service.”

Ms. Haley said the president’s budget proposal to slash the State Department budget by one-third was not meant to be enacted in its original form. “It was just his conversation point,” she said. “He was starting a conversation.”

Ms. Rice and Ms. Albright also pressed the administration to take Russia’s interference in last year’s election more seriously. Ms. Rice, a longtime Russia scholar, said that past Soviet disinformation campaigns were “clumsy” but last year’s effort was “highly sophisticated.”

“My own view is if they do this to us once it’s their fault,” she said. “If they do this to us twice, it’s ours.”

That is one area where Ms. Haley has been in agreement, even though she is working for a president who derides the “Russia story” as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats and the media.

“The Russians, God bless them, they’re saying, ‘Why are Americans anti-Russian and why have we done the sanctions?’” Ms. Haley said. “Well, don’t interfere in our elections and we won’t be anti-Russian. We have to be so hard on this and we have to hold them accountable.”

Mr. Bush echoed that in his own speech. “America has experienced a sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our country’s divisions,” he said. “According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other.” He added: “We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our election system from subversion.”

The former president acknowledged the forces of discontent that have given rise to Mr. Trump. “We should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization,” he said. “People are hurting. They’re angry and they’re frustrated. We must hear and help them. But we cannot wish globalization away any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”","Without Saying ‘Trump,’ George W.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

Backed by American-led coalition airstrikes, Iraq government forces celebrated their recapture of the city in July. But Mosul’s recovery is a tale of two cities.

In the eastern portion, somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of the population that fled during initial fighting over the city have already returned to their homes. But nine months of fighting in the west of Mosul, where militants holed up during their final stand, left the area virtually uninhabitable.

From medical centers to centuries-old mosques, major structures were reduced to rubble and whole neighborhoods wiped off the map. Some fell at the hands of militants who demolished infrastructure as the Iraqi military moved in, including the iconic Al Nuri mosque and its leaning minaret, and some were casualties of coalition airstrikes. Before the Islamic State captured the city, Mosul was home to 1.1 million people. United Nations officials estimate that just restoring basic services there could cost more than $1 billion.

Leila Jane Nassif, the United Nations refugee agency’s assistant representative in Iraq, said the damage in the western part of the city had left hundreds of thousands of people displaced. It is unclear when they will be able to return.

“It will take time for the infrastructure to be in place and for people to be able to rebuild their lives there with so much housing that has been damaged,” Ms. Nassif said in a telephone interview.

The actress and co-founder of the National Asian American Theater Company said that Mr. Hwang’s fame made him a valuable ally in the 1990 protests against casting the white actor Jonathan Pryce as the Eurasian lead in “Miss Saigon.” The success of “M. Butterfly” was “a pick-me-up.”

“You feel like, it’s Broadway, and he’s talking about the kind of things that were roiling around in our heads: the stereotypes, the colonial expectations of ‘Oriental’ women, the emasculation of Asian men — all that’s onstage in this very brilliant analysis of ‘Madame Butterfly.’

“In reaction to ‘Miss Saigon,’ I was in charge of putting together this town hall meeting at the Public Theater. The importance of having had a figure like David, and BD, who were very much in the forefront of what was going on with ‘Miss Saigon,’ was huge.

“Since then? All of a sudden there were two or three instances of yellowface in the space of two years just like three, four years ago. So you wonder. What’s going on?”

She didn’t discover theater until college, a few years after “M. Butterfly” closed. Encountering it as a text, she was dazzled — and awed that a critic from Time magazine had said Mr. Hwang could “become the first important dramatist of American public life since Arthur Miller.” Her new play, “Office Hour,” is in previews at the Public Theater.

“David Henry Hwang is not the only one, there is definitely a body of Asian-American theater, but he was the only one you could point to as being on Broadway. He was the only one you could point to as being lauded. It just was a little kind of light in a dark room.

“Being a college kid, I was like, ‘Oh my God, here’s an Asian-American writer who’s on the level of the great American writers.’ Just to be like, ‘Wow, he’s part of that conversation,’ was very inspiring and very much like, ‘There’s hope!’ I didn’t even know hope for what.”

When the Korean-born, Missouri-raised “Girls” writer told the playwright and producer Sarah Treem that he was thinking of going to graduate school for playwriting, she handed him a stack of plays, including “M. Butterfly.” Seven years later, he doesn’t think he could have written his immersive Off Broadway hit “KPOP” — about selling Korean music to Americans — without it.

“I remember reading it and feeling so shaken. It blew my mind. It completely changed the way that I thought about writing, but also the role of an artist in American culture.

“He is deconstructing this ancient notion of what it means to be Asian and what it means to be, in particular, an Asian person operating in the Western world. Before reading his work, I didn’t think I was entitled to deconstruct or critique or even portray that tension. I was always in my personal life taught to be silent and invisible and polite.

“I was an American guy. The fact that I was Asian and an immigrant, and English was not my first language, seemed like facts that were beside the point. In fact, those are fundamentally the point. Those are absolutely the markers in my life that I should be investigating, drawing from. David really, reading his work, taught me that that is what’s important.”",5 Artists on How ‘M.

幕后故事

Matias Costa for The New York Times 前往马德里的游客通常都会从市长广场开始游览。市长广场今年已经有400年的历史了。

对那些前往马德里的游客来说，通常都会从市长广场(Plaza Mayor)开始。而市长广场今年已经有400年的历史了。

该广场是为了给当时的新首都马德里创建一个城市中心而设。16世纪中叶，西班牙皇室将该国首都从托莱多迁至这里。建造工作于1617年开始，当时的国王是菲利普三世。作为纪念，他骑着马的雕塑被立在广场正中央。

广场就建在阿拉巴尔广场(Plaza del Arrabal)的市场原址上，后来先后被称为宪法广场(Plaza de la Constitución)、真之广场(Plaza Real)、共和国广场(Plaza de la República)，最后得名市长广场。

市长广场遭遇过的火灾，差不多和它曾有过的名字一样多。1631年、1670年和1790年的大火后，广场都必须再次重建。如今市长广场共有3层、9个拱门和237个阳台。

西班牙宗教法庭时期，这里曾是斗牛、加冕礼和处决的场地，如今市长广场上则遍布着商店、餐馆，还有一年一度的圣诞市集。

马德里以演讲、放映会和音乐、舞蹈表演作为今年的纪念活动。最近几天，广场还被覆盖上了绿茵。“我想找回那种绿色空间的精神，”这个名为SpY项目背后的艺术家告诉《国家报》(El País)，并引述市长广场在历史上曾是泥巴地和花园。","

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

He entered the foster system in April 2006.

For the next decade, Mr. Samuel grew inured to upheaval. Compliance with foster families felt pointless, he said, and putting in effort at school seemed futile.

“It was a lot of pressure for me, not seeing my parents, going to school at the same time,” Mr. Samuel said. “It was too much to balance.”

It was not until his late teenage years that he began to rein himself in, grasping the necessity of better positioning himself for a successful future. That revelation was born of discipline hammered into him from part-time jobs in the retail and service industries.

“Instead of me hanging outside at 2, 3 in the morning, I got a job and I’m coming home at 2, 3 in the morning,” Mr. Samuel said. “I love to work.”

Since aging out of foster care more than two years ago, he has lived in supportive housing in the Bronx. Mr. Samuel became interested in earning a high school diploma, but he admitted that procrastination had hampered his studies.

“I wish I could have done it at a younger age,” Mr. Samuel said. “I’d have been so good.”

Mr. Samuel also began taking advantage of the services offered at the Next Generation Center, a Children’s Aid program in the Bronx that helps young people transition to adulthood and independence. There, he connected with a life coach and enrolled in its culinary arts program.

In 2016, just shy of his 22nd birthday, Mr. Samuel received his Regents diploma from the High School for Service and Learning at Erasmus, an alternative school in Brooklyn. Weeks later, he received his food handler’s license. He would like to open a restaurant, if his rapping ambitions are not realized. College is probably on the horizon, he said, just not right away.

“I definitely need the break from school,” Mr. Samuel said.

In the spring, Children’s Aid used Neediest Cases funds to buy $150 in gift cards for Mr. Samuel for food and professional clothing — khakis, shirt and tie — for a job search. He currently works in concessions at the Barclays Center and Yankee Stadium.

Mr. Samuel’s sister, now a teenager, remains in the foster care system, and he implores her to learn from his mistakes.

“I tell her, all the homes have rules and you have to abide them,” Mr. Samuel said. “Even if they’re not your family, they’re the reason you’ve got a roof over your head. Go to school, do what you got to do. It’ll be a breeze.”

Those heart-to-heart talks remind him of his delayed progress, and reinforce for him that his recent successes have paved the way for untold opportunity.

Victorians abound. South of Montauk Highway, the main east-west thoroughfare, grandes dames are set back on deep lots along broad, shady avenues stretching south to the bay.

“A sprinkling of homes have docks,” said Andrea Casey, a salesperson with Century 21 Bay’s Edge Realty. While most of the coastline is reserved for commercial and public use, houses along Sunset Drive and West Lane back up to canals.

At the tip of Foster Avenue, Sayville Marina Park’s three tennis courts, sandy beach and boat docks dominate the waterfront. Nearby, manicured gardens and a gazebo at Land’s End Caterers provide a picturesque bay-front setting for weddings, said Manon Compitello, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who lives in Sayville.

North of Montauk Highway, there are newer two-story houses built on three-quarter-acre lots on cul-de-sacs. Capes and ranches occupy smaller lots. Condos, co-ops, age-restricted rental apartments and an assisted-living facility line Lakeland Avenue, the thoroughfare stretching north to Sunrise Highway’s big box shopping areas.

What You’ll Pay

“We get a lot of first-time home buyers who want to be in Sayville,” said Leesa Byrnes, broker-owner of Leesa Byrnes Realty. A three-bedroom, two-bath ranch in good shape on a quarter-acre lot, she said, will run between $375,000 and $400,000. Homes that need work range from the low- to mid-$300,000s, while trade-up homes with four bedrooms and two and a half baths on half-acre lots will cost about $650,000.

On Oct. 11, there were 39 houses and nine condominiums on the market. The priciest, at $1,199,000, was a restored five-bedroom 1890 Victorian with an in-ground pool on a half-acre. The least expensive, at $245,000, was a two-bedroom, one-level condo at the age-restricted Sunrise Village, a gated community built in 1987.

Good schools are a draw, Ms. Compitello said, and because Sayville is not incorporated, “you get all the benefits of a town without a village tax.”

But “one of our biggest struggles is our lack of inventory” coupled with “lots of buyers,” she added, noting that homes are selling faster and at higher prices than a year ago. The average sales price in 2017, through Oct. 11, was $453,736, a 5.8 percent increase over the average price of the same period the previous year, $428,691.

The Vibe

Locals buzz about plans for the former Island Hills Golf Club, at the hamlet’s northern edge. Developers Gregg and Mitchell D. Rechler, who bought the property last year, have been meeting with community groups, hoping to change the single-family zoning to build Greybarn, a multifamily rental community with 1,378 apartments “geared to keep millennials and downsizers close to home,” Gregg Rechler said.

Clustered in three- and four-story buildings, with rooflines and eaves resembling large Hamptons-style summer houses, the property is being designed to “benefit the people who already live in the community, as well as the residents who live in Greybarn,” Mr. Rechler said. A 22-acre “perimeter park around the property that equates to a two-mile walking and bike trail will have various pocket parks as it goes along,” he continued, including a playground, an exercise park and a dog park. Plans also call for a community farm, a pond, multiple swimming pools and a large clubhouse with a fitness center and screening rooms.

A shuttle will take residents from Greybarn to stores and restaurants downtown.

The Schools

There are 2,948 students in the well-regarded Sayville public schools, which draw from Sayville and West Sayville.

Students in kindergarten through grade five attend Cherry Avenue Elementary School, Lincoln Avenue Elementary School or Sunrise Drive Elementary School. Grades six to eight are served by Sayville Middle School. Students move up to Sayville High School for grades nine to 12.

The latest available mean SAT scores were 533 in reading, 564 in math and 521 in writing, compared to New York State scores of 489, 501 and 477.

Some Sayville properties are zoned for the Connetquot Central School District.

The Commute

Commuters to Manhattan, 56 miles west, can catch a train at the Sayville station on the Babylon branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour rides to Penn Station take from an hour and 16 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes. Most trips to Manhattan require changing trains in Jamaica or Babylon. The monthly fare is $391.

The History

Once the South Side Railroad reached Sayville in 1868, the hamlet became a summer resort. Actors and actresses stayed in hotels and rented houses in the area. From 1909 to 1919, a seasonal trolley — initially horse-drawn, later electric — connected the railroad station with hotels along Candee Avenue, said George J. Munkenbeck, the Islip town historian.","Sayville, N.Y.: A Walkable Downtown and Victorians by the Bay",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/realestate/living-in-sayville-ny.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the “president” of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.
The world has seen powerful leaders use lying as a form of mass manipulation before.","According to James Murphy’s translation of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf”:

“In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.”

The text continues:

“It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.”

This demonstrates a precise understanding of human psychology, but also the dangerously manipulative nature that operates in the mind of a demon.

And yet, as many have noted, no person of sound reason or even cursory political awareness can read this and not be immediately struck by how similar this strategy of lying is to Donald Trump’s seeming strategy of lying: Tell a lie bigger than people think a lie can be, thereby forcing their brains to seek truth in it, or vest some faith in it, even after no proof can be found.

Trump is no Hitler, but the way he has manipulated the American people with outrageous lies, stacked one on top of the other, has an eerie historical resonance. Demagogy has a fixed design.

It should be mentioned that Vanity Fair reported in 1990 that Trump’s first wife, Ivana, “told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, ‘My New Order,’ which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed.” The magazine pointed out that “Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist.” (At the time, Trump said, “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.”)

Trump has found a way to couch the lies so that people believe they don’t emanate from him but pass through him. He is not a producer but a projector.

One way he does this is by using caveats — “I was told,” “Lots of people are saying” — as shields.

Jenna Johnson of The Washington Post addressed this in June 2016, writing about Trump’s use of the phrase “a lot of people are saying”:

“Trump frequently couches his most controversial comments this way, which allows him to share a controversial idea, piece of tabloid gossip or conspiracy theory without technically embracing it. If the comment turns out to be popular, Trump will often drop the distancing qualifier — ‘people think’ or ‘some say.’ If the opposite happens, Trump can claim that he never said the thing he is accused of saying, equating it to retweeting someone else’s thoughts on Twitter.”

In August of 2016, Gregory Krieg and Jeff Simon came to a similar conclusion about Trump’s use of these phrases, pointing out on CNN:

“Trump has a habit of punctuating his more self-assured claims with the phrase ‘believe me.’ But when he wants space between himself and the words he is about to speak or tweet, he defers to other sources, relying on a rhetorical sleight.”

Just this week, Trump told the colossal lie that “President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls” to the families of fallen soldiers.

When called out about this lie, he quickly retreated to one of his shield phrases: “That’s what I was told.”

He even projects his own ignorance onto others with his lies. As Steve Benen pointed out in July on MSNBC.com, Trump’s “awkward process of discovery has, however, produced a phrase of underappreciated beauty: ‘A lot of people don’t know that.’ These seven words are Trump’s way of saying, ‘I just learned something new, and I’m going to assume others are as ignorant as I am.’ ”

This is not a simple fear of the truth; it is a weaponizing of untruth. It is the use of the lie to assault and subdue. It is Trump doing to political ends what Hitler did to more brutal ends: using mass deception as masterful propaganda.

Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the “president” of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror. It is an intentional self-blinding to avoid offending frail sensibilities.

I have neither time nor patience for such tiptoeing. I prefer the boot of truth to slam down to earth like thunder, no matter the shock of hearing its clap.

The world has seen powerful leaders use lying as a form of mass manipulation before. It is seeing it now, and it will no doubt see it again. History recycles. But the result doesn’t have to be — and hopefully never will be again — a holocaust. It can manifest as a multitude of other, lesser horrors, in both protocol and policy, including the corrosion and regression of country and culture.

That is the very real threat we are facing. Trump isn’t necessarily a direct threat to your life — unless of course you are being kept alive by health care that he keeps threatening, or if you’re in Puerto Rico reeling in the wake of two hurricanes — but he is very much a threat to your quality of life.

New technologies like electric and autonomously driven vehicles are forcing major changes while the center of gravity in the car business is shifting toward Asia. “There is a lot of fluidity in the entire industry space, which is what these players see,” Mr. Wells said.

In an interview at a pub called The Grenadier in London, Mr. Ratcliffe explained that terminating the much-loved Defender would create demand for a replacement because it “had left quite a hole in the marketplace.” He criticized the many SUVs still being sold as “jelly molds” that all look alike.

Mr. Ratcliffe owns two versions of the Defender — one from 1955 and a so-called Heritage model made near the end of its production run. He said he wants to preserve the Defender’s boxy, military-style ruggedness.

Toby Ecuyer, a yacht designer, has the job of turning Mr. Ratcliffe’s ideas into drawings. “What we are trying to design is something extremely utilitarian,” not a luxury vehicle, he said.

Mr. Ratcliffe conceded that the new vehicle will need updates to meet global safety and emission standards, including in the United States, where its sales stopped in 1997. He said he planned to make about 25,000 vehicles a year — about the number of Defenders sold in 2015, the year before its production was halted.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Tata, an India-based conglomerate, has found success with luxury models like the Range Rover. The company said in a statement that it had plans for the Defender and would pay close attention to any actions regarding its “proprietary rights.”

Mr. Ratcliffe built a $40 billion per year petrochemical empire called Ineos by buying chemical plants that other companies wanted to discard and then running them more efficiently. He said he can also find cheaper ways to operate a car company as well.

According to his team, for instance, European manufacturers had already expressed an interest in either building his car on contract or selling him a fully equipped plant. Either way, that would help limit upfront investment and risk. He said he did not want to put in more than 600 million pounds — less than the $1 billion analysts estimate that development and production of a new model typically costs.

Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the CAR center at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said he doubted that an updated version of an old concept would have appeal beyond a dwindling group of enthusiasts. A few would buy Mr. Ratcliffe’s car, he said, but it would “become a niche which gets smaller over time.”

Mr. Dyson has been much more guarded about his plans. “It’s not a sports car and not a very cheap car,” he told reporters at his company store on London’s bustling Oxford Street in late September. He recounted that in the 1990s he had designed a device for cleaning truck exhaust but received a cool reception from vehicle manufacturers. Instead, he focused his efforts on electric motors and batteries, hoping that one day he could step up to cars.

He has reached that point. Mr. Dyson has purchased a World War II-era airfield near his company’s headquarters in Malmesbury, in southern England, where the development work will continue. He said the new vehicle will offer a “radical” electric motor design that he said would be more efficient than those available on the market now.

Mr. Dyson has proved himself a dogged inventor, designing high-end vacuum cleaners and other products like hair dryers. His technological savvy gives him a chance of scoring a hit in the much more complex and costly global car industry, analysts said. In 2015, he bought Sakti3, an American start-up that is working with solid state batteries. Mr. Dyson said he could be on track to commercializing a so-called solid state battery, which analysts say might be more powerful and safer than the lithium ion devices now used in electric cars and cellphones. He said both the start-up and his own team were working on the project.

“The edge that Dyson have if they do have an edge is to possibly be ahead of the game in solid state batteries,” said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank.

As nascent as they are, the plans Mr. Dyson has laid out will be expensive, particularly for a medium-size company like Dyson. Mr. Dyson said he would spend £1 billion on the car and another £1 billion on the battery — a lot of money for a company that reported £2.5 billion in revenue last year.

He may need to spend more. Tesla, for instance, has already spent about $6 billion, according to analysts’ estimates.

Mr. Dyson said he planned to develop not only a new motor but a new chassis. “We are starting from scratch,” he said. “There isn’t one that is suitable.”

Electric cars are clearly a high-risk venture. Mr. Houchois said none of the vehicles on the market, including those made by Tesla, which recently reported disappointing production numbers on its new Model 3, are making money for their owners. Dyson may seek to bring costs down by manufacturing in Asia, where it already makes appliances.

Still, whatever his reputation, Mr. Dyson has set himself a formidable task. “It is one thing to design and manufacture a household item,” said R. A. Farrokhnia, a professor at the business and engineering schools at Columbia University. “And quite another to prototype and then build a complex electric vehicle.”",An Electric Car and a Rugged Throwback: The Dreams of 2 Rich Britons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/automobiles/wheels/startup-car-markers.html

Clearly, this kind of investing is not for everyone. No investment is a sure thing, but investing precious retirement money in neighborhood businesses, or a pal’s peanut farms, comes with risks far beyond the usual volatility in the stock market. You could lose it all — and lose a friend in the process.

In September 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a fraud alert on self-directed I.R.A.s. Among the commission’s concerns: it is easy to exploit self-directed I.R.A.s. Since the investments aren’t publicly traded, it can be harder to get the information needed to make smart investing decisions, raising the chances of fraud.

“Every investment has different risks,” said Kirk Chisholm, a wealth manager in Lexington, Mass. “The obvious risk is making a bad investment,” he said. After all, that’s the whole point of investing for retirement — to build a nest egg. “If you’re doing it just to help someone out, that’s not a good investment. You want to make sure it makes your retirement money grow, or why invest at all?”

He also suggests people invest in areas in which they have some expertise rather than operating blindly, even if they have the desire to do something good for another person or the community.

“You can be well intentioned and still be misguided,” said Nevin Adams, chief content officer at the American Retirement Association, a nonprofit member organization in Arlington, Va. “But the reality is, this is your I.R.A.; the reason it has protections is because it’s something you are investing for retirement. It might be a good cause, but it might not be good for your retirement.”

Mr. Brown — the man who invested in his friend’s child-care building — has a big advantage in this dangerous game: Because he is a tax lawyer by profession he is well aware of the potential risks and how to avoid them.

In his case, he structured a lease and option to buy back that would provide him with a fixed 10 percent annual return, regardless of how long he owned the real estate and when his friends exercised the option. He is aware that commercial real estate investors normally expect a greater return (rent plus appreciation), he said. But “I didn’t feel right doing it in the manner most real estate investors would do it, in light of my relationship with this friend.”

“The option was structured at a price equal to my purchase price, with a portion of their rent payments being credited against the purchase price if and when they exercised the option,” he said. That structure gave his friends an incentive to exercise the option as soon as they could, while still giving Mr. Brown the 10 percent annual return he was seeking.

“It also worked so that I did not feel I was gouging them, while still protecting my retirement-plan assets,” Mr. Brown said.","Should You Invest Your I.R.A. in Friends, Family or Charitable Work?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/invest-ira.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself.","The video is now TED’s second-most popular, having been seen, to date, by some 43 million viewers. In the years after the talk, Cuddy became a sought-after speaker, a quasi celebrity and, eventually, the author of a best-selling book, “Presence,” in 2015. The power pose became the sun salutation for the professional woman on the cusp of leaning in. Countless hopefuls, male and female, locked themselves in bathroom stalls before job interviews to make victory V’s with their arms; media trainers had their speakers dutifully practice the pose before approaching the stage. Cuddy has gone on to give talks on power and the body (including power posing) and stereotyping to women’s groups in Australia, at youth homeless shelters, to skin-care workers by the thousands, to employees at Target and agents at State Farm Insurance. Cuddy’s fans approach her in airports, on ski slopes in Telluride, in long lines after her talks, to hug or to thank her, filled with their own power-posing stories — sharing how bold body language helped them get their jobs or win some match or confront a bully at work.

But since 2015, even as she continued to stride onstage and tell the audiences to face down their fears, Cuddy has been fighting her own anxieties, as fellow academics have subjected her research to exceptionally high levels of public scrutiny. She is far from alone in facing challenges to her work: Since 2011, a methodological reform movement has been rattling the field, raising the possibility that vast amounts of research, even entire subfields, might be unreliable. Up-and-coming social psychologists, armed with new statistical sophistication, picked up the cause of replications, openly questioning the work their colleagues conducted under a now-outdated set of assumptions. The culture in the field, once cordial and collaborative, became openly combative, as scientists adjusted to new norms of public critique while still struggling to adjust to new standards of evidence.

Cuddy, in particular, has emerged from this upheaval as a unique object of social psychology’s new, enthusiastic spirit of self-flagellation — as if only in punishing one of its most public stars could it fully break from its past. At conferences, in classrooms and on social media, fellow academics (or commenters on their sites) have savaged not just Cuddy’s work but also her career, her income, her ambition, even her intelligence, sometimes with evident malice. Last spring, she quietly left her tenure-track job at Harvard.

Some say that she has gained fame with an excess of confidence in fragile results, that she prized her platform over scientific certainty. But many of her colleagues, and even some who are critical of her choices, believe that the attacks on her have been excessive and overly personal. What seems undeniable is that the rancor of the critiques reflects the emotional toll among scientists forced to confront the fear that what they were doing all those years may not have been entirely scientific.

One of the seminal social-psychology studies, at the turn of the 20th century, asked a question that at the time was a novel one: How does the presence of other people change an individual’s behavior? Norman Triplett, a psychologist at Indiana University, found that when he asked children to execute a simple task (winding line on a fishing rod), they performed better in the company of other children than they did when alone in a room. Over the following decades, a new discipline grew up within psychology to further interrogate group dynamics: how social groups react in certain circumstances, how the many can affect the one.

The questions grew even more profound, using experiments to tease out universal susceptibilities, raising the possibility that behavior was more easily swayed by outside forces than personality researchers previously believed. The field reached a moment of unusual visibility in the mid-20th century, as practitioners, many of them Jewish refugees or first-generation immigrants from Europe, explored, post-World War II, the way group pressures or authority figures could influence human behavior. In one simple study on conformity in 1951, the social psychologist Solomon Asch found that people would agree that one drawn line matched the length of another — even if it clearly did not — if others around them all agreed that it did. In subsequent years, researchers like Stanley Milgram (who tested how people weighed their consciences against the demands of authority) and Philip Zimbardo (who observed the effect of power on students assigned as either prison guards or prisoners) rejected the traditional confines of the lab for more theatrical displays of human nature. “They felt the urgency of history,” says Rebecca Lemov, a professor of the history of science at Harvard. “They really wanted to make people look.”

Since the late 1960s, the field’s psychologists have tried to elevate the scientific rigor of their work, introducing controls and carefully designed experiments like the ones found in medicine. Increasingly complex ideas about the workings of the unconscious yielded research with the charm of mesmerists’ shows, revealing unlikely forces that seem to guide our behavior: that simply having people wash their hands could change their sense of culpability; that people’s evaluations of risk could easily be rendered irrational; that once people have made a decision, they curiously give more weight to information in its favor. Humans, the research often suggested, were reliably mercurial, highly suggestible, profoundly irrational, tricksters better at fooling ourselves than anyone else.

Already relatively accessible to the public, the field became even more influential with the rise of behavioral economics in the 1980s and 1990s, as visionaries like Richard Thaler, (who won the Nobel Prize in economics this month) found applications for counterintuitive social-psychology insights that could be used to guide policy. In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell, the author of the best-selling “Tipping Point,” applied irresistible storytelling to the science, sending countless journalists to investigate similar terrain and inspiring social psychologists to write books of their own. In 2006, Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, published the best seller “Stumbling on Happiness” — a book that tried to explain why we plan so poorly for our own future. That same year, TED started airing its first videos, offering a new stage for social psychologists with compelling findings, ideally surprising ones. The field was experiencing a visibility unknown since the midcentury; business schools, eager for social psychologists’ insights into leadership and decision-making, started pursuing social psychologists, with better pay and more funding than psychology graduate schools could offer.

This moment of fizziness for the discipline was already underway when Cuddy arrived at Princeton’s graduate program in 2000, transferring there to follow her adviser, Susan Fiske, with whom she first worked at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She moved to Princeton with her husband at the time — they later divorced — and in her second year there, she had a child. Her academic work continued to thrive as she collaborated with Fiske on research on stereotyping, which found that groups of people (for example of a particular ethnicity) who were judged as nice were assumed to be less competent and vice versa. (“Just Because I’m Nice Don’t Assume I’m Dumb,” was the headline of a Harvard Business Review article by Cuddy.) Fiske and Cuddy’s resulting papers are still heavily cited, formulating a framework for stereotyping that proved hugely influential on the field.

And yet, especially early on at Princeton, Cuddy felt uncertain of her place there. She feared that her brain simply could not function at a high-enough level to power her through the program. Cuddy suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident the summer after her sophomore year in college, when a friend of hers fell asleep at the wheel while Cuddy was asleep in the back seat. In the months after the accident, Cuddy was told she should not expect to finish college; her fog was so deep that she remembers being retaught how to shop for groceries. Even after Cuddy recovered, her friends told her that she had changed, that she was not the same person — but she could not remember who she had been before. It took her four years and multiple false starts before she could return to college. Even after she was accepted to graduate school at University of Massachusetts, she confessed to Fiske that she feared she would not be able to keep up with the work.

Cuddy was trained as a ballet dancer — in between her stints at college, she danced as an apprentice with the Colorado Ballet — but her interest in studying the body and its relationship to power did not begin until 2009, her first year as a teacher at Harvard Business School. At the invitation of her department chair, she joined a small circle of academics meeting with Joe Navarro, a former F.B.I. agent who had written a book about body language. The invited parties, which included Dana Carney, a professor at Columbia University who studied body language and power, all spoke briefly about their work. In the conversation that followed, Navarro pointed out that Cuddy’s own body language, during her presentation, signaled insecurity: She was fiddling with her necklace, wrapping her arms around her torso.

Carney and Cuddy had been noticing the same kinds of body language in their female students, who performed well on written materials but lost points, compared with their male counterparts, on class participation. Their body language was constricted; they raised their hands with their elbows cradled in their other hands; they made themselves physically small; they spoke less often.

The two researchers wondered whether people whose physical cues looked like their female students’ — self-protective, insecure — would feel more powerful or even change their behavior if they simply adopted more expansive body positions.

Carney and Cuddy brainstormed a research project to test this question. At Columbia, Carney recruited students, telling them that they were part of a study intended to measure the effects of placing an electrocardiograph’s electrodes either above or below the heart. In the study of 42 subjects that they eventually published, experimenters arranged half the students into positions associated with high power (leaning back in a chair with feet crossed on a desk, for example) and half the students into positions associated with low power (like crossing arms in front of the body). Before and after the poses, experimenters took saliva swabs from the students to measure how the positions affected cortisol and testosterone levels. They also asked the students to report (before and after the poses) how in charge and powerful they felt on a scale of one to four (a measurement known as “self-reported feelings of power”). And they measured whether that feeling had what researchers call a “downstream effect” — a resulting behavior. People who feel power, the literature suggests, are more likely to engage in a range of certain behaviors, including risk-taking; so the experiment also measured the subjects’ willingness to bet on a roll of the dice.

“I remember how happy we were when Dana called me with the results,” Cuddy says. “Everything went in the direction it was supposed to.” The abstract that they eventually wrote — that their editors approved — reflects the incautious enthusiasm that characterized the era: “That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful, has real-world, actionable implications.”

In 2014, on a podcast called “Story Collider,” Cuddy connects the study that made her so famous with the accident that subtly shifted her identity. After the crash, she recalled, she felt as if she were merely passing for herself, an inauthentic version of who she used to be. It made sense, then, that she ended up “studying how people can become their aspirational selves,” she said. “How can you become a self that you are not now?”

The year that Amy Cuddy published her power-posing paper, Joseph Simmons, who attended graduate school at Princeton with Cuddy, was starting to think about his own seminal paper, one that would, unknown to either of them, have as much influence on her life as it would on his own; it would, in fact, change not just their lives but the field as they knew it, with wildly differing consequences for each of them.

Cuddy and Simmons, each of whom came from working-class backgrounds, had been fond of each other at Princeton, even if they did not socialize often: Cuddy was a new mother, and Simmons was five years younger and heavily committed to his softball team. Simmons considered Cuddy a friend, someone he was always happy to see at a party, despite their obvious differences: Cuddy, who used to follow the Grateful Dead, would have been the one dancing at the party, while Simmons would have been the one laughing with his close friend, a fellow graduate student named Leif Nelson, about the latest buzzy journal article that seemed, to them, ridiculous.

Having arrived at Princeton wide-eyed, straight from Mount St. Mary’s College in Maryland, Simmons, within a few years, appeared to some of his classmates to have lost some of his idealism about academia; maybe he exhibited his idealism about science in a way that could be mistaken for cynicism. Simmons had an unusual interest in statistics, the way its airtight logic could neatly prove, or disprove, the worth of an extravagant idea. He and Nelson were endlessly critical of other studies’ findings, an intellectual exercise they enjoyed and considered essential. The two of them, Nelson says, were “into thinking about subtleties in data collection and analysis.”

After finishing a postdoctoral program at Princeton, Simmons lost touch with Cuddy, who was by then teaching at Northwestern. He remained close to Nelson, who had befriended a behavioral scientist, also a skeptic, Uri Simonsohn. Nelson and Simonsohn kept up an email correspondence for years. They, along with Simmons, took particular umbrage when a prestigious journal accepted a paper from an emeritus professor of psychology at Cornell, Daryl Bem, who claimed that he had strong evidence for the existence of extrasensory perception. The paper struck them as the ultimate in bad-faith science. “How can something not be possible to cause something else?” Nelson says. “Oh, you reverse time, then it can’t.” And yet the methodology was supposedly sound. After years of debating among themselves, the three of them resolved to figure out how so many researchers were coming up with such unlikely results.

Over the course of several months of conference calls and computer simulations, the three researchers eventually determined that the enemy of science — subjectivity — had burrowed its way into the field’s methodology more deeply than had been recognized. Typically, when researchers analyzed data, they were free to make various decisions, based on their judgment, about what data to maintain: whether it was wise, for example, to include experimental subjects whose results were really unusual or whether to exclude them; to add subjects to the sample or exclude additional subjects because of some experimental glitch. More often than not, those decisions — always seemingly justified as a way of eliminating noise — conveniently strengthened the findings’ results. The field (hardly unique in this regard) had approved those kinds of tinkering for years, underappreciating just how powerfully they skewed the results in favor of false positives, particularly if two or three analyses were underway at the same time. The three eventually wrote about this phenomenon in a paper called “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011. “Everyone knew it was wrong, but they thought it was wrong the way it’s wrong to jaywalk,” Simmons recently wrote in a paper taking stock of the field. “We decided to write ‘False-Positive Psychology’ when simulations revealed it was wrong the way it’s wrong to rob a bank.”

Simmons called those questionable research practices P-hacking, because researchers used them to lower a crucial measure of statistical significance known as the P-value. The P stands for probable, as in: How probable is it that researchers would happen to get the results they achieved — or even more extreme ones — if there were no phenomena, in truth, to observe? (And no systematic error.) For decades, the standard of so-called statistical significance — also the hurdle to considering a study publishable — has been a P-value of less than 5 percent.

To examine how easily the science could be manipulated, Simmons and Simonsohn ran a study in which they asked 20 participants their ages (and their fathers’ birthdays). Half the group listened to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four”; the other listened to a control (the instrumental music “Kalimba”). Using totally standard methodology common to the field, they were able to prove that the participants who listened to the Beatles song were magically a year and a half younger than they were before they had heard the music. The subject heading of the explanation: “How Bad Can It Be? A Demonstration of Chronological Rejuvenation.” It was witty, it was relatable — everyone understood that it was a critique of the fundamental soundness of the field.

“We realized entire literatures could be false positives,” Simmons says. They had collaborated with enough other researchers to recognize that the practice was widespread and counted themselves among the guilty. “I P-hacked like crazy all through my time at Princeton, and I still couldn’t get interesting results,” Simmons says.

The paper generated its fair share of attention, but it was not until January 2012, at a tense conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology in San Diego, that social psychologists began to glimpse the iceberg looming ahead — the sliding furniture, the recriminations, the crises of conscience and finger-pointing and side-taking that would follow. At the conference, several hundred academics crowded into the room to hear Simmons and his colleagues challenge the methodology of their field. First, Leslie John, then a graduate student, now an associate professor at the Harvard School of Business, presented a survey of 2,000 social psychologists that suggested that P-hacking, as well as other questionable research practices, was common. In his presentation, Simonsohn introduced a new concept, a graph that could be used to evaluate bodies of research, using the P-values of those studies (the lower the overall P-values, the better). He called it a P-curve and suggested that it could be used, for example, to evaluate the research that a prospective job candidate submitted. To some, the implication of the combined presentations seemed clear: The field was rotten with the practice, and egregious P-hackers should not get away with it.

Journal-paper presentations on statistics are usually unremarkable affairs, but this one precipitated a sequence of exchanges so public that the field had to take notice. The first took place during that event, with Norbert Schwarz, an eminent social psychologist, in the audience. Schwarz, as he listened, grew furious: He believed that the methodology of the survey was flawed, and he indignantly objected to the idea of the P-curve as a kind of litmus test aimed at individuals. He would not let these ideas go uncontested; he interrupted loudly from the front row, violating standard academic etiquette. “The whole room was like, ‘Oh, my God, what just happened?’ ” recalls Brian Nosek, a social psychologist who now runs the Center for Open Science, intended to encourage and normalize replications. Others quietly thanked Schwarz for bravely speaking up.

Not content to stop there, Schwarz followed up four days later with an open letter to 5,000 members of the society’s listserv, explaining in further detail, and with some condescension, his reservations. Although Simonsohn was angry, he still hoped to cool down the conversation. He emailed Schwarz asking if they could talk, so that they could come to a sort of understanding, in the name of science, and release a joint statement. Schwarz agreed but told Simonsohn, over the course of several email exchanges, that he needed more time. Simonsohn lost patience after three weeks: He posted large parts of the email exchange on his personal website, then posted a blistering attack on Schwarz on the society’s listserv, filled with bold caps and underlines, in which he said, among other things, that he knew firsthand that Schwarz had engaged in P-hacking.

“I regret it,” Simonsohn says now about posting the emails. Since then, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson say they have given a lot of thought to codes of conduct for communicating responsibly when conveying concerns about a scientist’s work. But the academic blowup between Simonsohn, then a relative unknown in social psychology, and Schwarz, the standard-bearer, signaled from the beginning that leaders on each side would ignore the norms of scientific discourse in an effort to discredit the other. One imminent shift in methods would bring another shift — one of tone — that would affect the field almost as drastically.

After 2012, questions of methodology started dominating every social-psychology conference, as did the topic of replications. Across disciplines, a basic scientific principle is that multiple teams should independently verify a result before it is accepted as true. But for the majority of social-psychology results, even the most influential ones, this hadn’t happened. Brian Nosek, who started the Reproducibility Project (now called the Center for Open Science), an effort to test 100 important social-psychology papers, said that recognition of potential flawed methodology only fueled interest in his project. “The paper shone a light on how easily things could go wrong,” Nosek says. “Knowing that possibility in concept made the Reproducibility Project a test case in some people’s mind of ‘Does it?’ ”

For years, researchers treated journal articles, and their authors, with a genteel respect; even in the rare cases where a new study explicitly contradicted an old one, the community assumed that a lab error must account for the discrepancy. There was no incentive to replicate, in any case: Journals were largely not interested in studies that had already been done, and failed replications made people (maybe even your adviser) uncomfortable.

But in the years after that Society of Personality and Social Psychology conference, a sense of urgency propelled a generation of researchers, most of them under 40, to re-examine the work of other, more established researchers. And politeness was no longer a priority. “All of a sudden you have people emailing other people, asking for their data and then writing blog posts accusing them of shoddy practices,” says Eli Finkel, a social psychologist at Northwestern. “That was unheard-of. Now it was happening all the time.” Some blog posts took on the impact of journal articles, as interested parties weighed in with an impromptu peer review. In 2014, Psychological Science started giving electronic badges, an extra seal of approval, to studies that made their data and methodologies publicly available and preregistered their design and analysis ahead of time, so that researchers could not fish around for a new hypothesis if they turned up some unexpected findings.

Not surprisingly, replicators sometimes encountered the kind of outraged resistance that Simmons and Simonsohn initially did. The same month that Simmons and Simonsohn gave their talk, Stéphane Doyen, a social psychologist in Belgium, published a paper challenging a classic study in the field of priming, which holds that small cues, like exposure to certain words, can subconsciously trigger behaviors. The original study found that research subjects walked more slowly after being exposed to words associated with old age; the replicators found no such effect and titled their journal article “Behavioral Priming: It’s All in the Mind; but Whose Mind?” John Bargh, a professor at Yale, a luminary who published the original study, responded with a combative post on Psychology Today’s blog, claiming that discrepancies in the experiment design accounted for the difference and calling the researchers “incompetent or ill informed.” When other priming studies failed to replicate later that year, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, who discussed priming in his book “Thinking Fast and Slow,” wrote a letter to social psychologists who studied the effect, urging them to turn their attitude around. “To deal effectively with the doubts, you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on,” he wrote.

The intention of replicators was now unassailably noble — who could argue with better science? — but there was also, for the first time, status to be found in topplings, as journals started publishing more replications, many of which received lavish press attention. It was also inevitable that those being challenged would read envy into their attackers’ motivations. (In a tweet, Gilbert described those he deemed the worst offenders as “shameless little bullies.”)

Jay Van Bavel, a social psychologist at New York University, has tweeted openly about a published nonreplication of one of his studies and believes, as any scientist would, that replications are an essential part of the process; nonetheless, he found the experience of being replicated painful. “It is terrifying, even if it’s fair and within normal scientific bounds,” he says. “Because of social media and how it travels — you get pile-ons when the critique comes out, and 50 people share it in the view of thousands. That’s horrifying for anyone who’s critiqued, even if it’s legitimate.”

The field, clearly, was not moving forward as one. “In the beginning, I thought it was all ridiculous,” says Finkel, who told me it took him a few years before he appreciated the importance of what became known as the replication movement. “It was like we had been having a big party — what big, new, fun, cool stuff can we discover? And we forgot to double-check ourselves. And then the reformers were annoyed, because they felt like they had to come in after the fact and clean up after us. And it was true.”

In August 2014, the day before her second marriage, Amy Cuddy learned that a replication of her 2010 study led by a 34-year-old economist at the University of Zurich named Eva Ranehill had failed to yield the same results. “I remember thinking, Oh, bummer,” Cuddy says. But she was not distraught; often there was some perfectly good reason for a discrepancy in two studies of the same concept.

There were several key differences — Ranehill’s sample size, at 200, was much bigger, and she had designed a double-blind setup. Ranehill had her subjects hold two poses for three minutes each. She did not find an increase in either risk-taking behavior or the expected hormone changes.

Cuddy thought it was likely that the difference in time — six minutes of standing versus two — was a crucial one and probably accounted for the disparity in the results. “It’s not a crazy thing to test,” Cuddy says. “I guess under the theory that more is better? But it could go the other way — three minutes is a really, really long time to be holding a pose like that. It seems likely to me that it would be really uncomfortable, but sure, study it, and let’s see.”

She was relieved to see that the “feelings of power” finding had replicated. But Ranehill used language in her write-up that played down that finding’s importance. Although in one study of her own, Cuddy also played down the finding, she has otherwise consistently, in interviews, been enthusiastic about the idea that a body posture could change someone’s feelings. “We’re psychologists,” she says. “We try to change how people feel.” She also, at the time of the Ranehill replication, still anticipated that other research would probably show downstream effects — more risk taking, or more competitiveness, or better performance in job interviews.

By the time Cuddy got word of Ranehill’s replication, she had given her TED talk, developed a significant speaking career and was writing a book. Simmons had received tenure at Wharton and was writing, with Simonsohn, a blog called Data Colada, in which they sometimes tried to replicate other people’s work. By 2014, there was near-unanimous agreement the Data Colada team had profoundly changed the field’s research techniques for the better. But for the average researcher, an email from someone at Data Colada signaled unpleasantness ahead. “It’s like the police knocking on your door in the middle of the night,” one psychologist said.

In the wake of Ranehill’s failed replication, Cuddy and Carney set to work on a response. Carney, who is now a tenured associate professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley, tried to chart a P-curve of all 33 studies they were mentioning in their paper (which was already under review). Carney sent the paper and the P-curve to Nelson for some feedback, but he sent it on to Simmons and Simonsohn, as they were the experts.

The letter Simmons wrote back to Carney was polite, but he argued that her P-curve had not been executed correctly. He and Simonsohn had each executed P-curves of the 33 studies, and each found that it was flat, suggesting that the body of literature it reflected did not count as strong evidence. He did write that “conceptual points raised before that section are useful and contribute to the debate” but that they should take the P-curve out. “Everybody wins in that case.” According to Cuddy, she and Carney thought the P-curve science was not as settled as Simmons believed it to be. But afraid of public recrimination, they did exactly as he said — they took out the P-curve.

A few weeks after the paper was published, Cuddy learned from Simmons and Simonsohn that they were writing a blog post on the paper. A mutual friend of Cuddy and Simmons’s from graduate school, Kenworthey Bilz, a professor of law at the University of Illinois, tried to reassure Cuddy. “He’ll say his piece, and you’ll say yours, and that will be the end of it,” Bilz told Cuddy. “It’s not like you’re going to become the poster girl for this kind of thing.”

Cuddy was at her home office in Boston when she received an email from Simmons and Simonsohn. They showed her a draft of the post they planned to put online criticizing the paper; they invited feedback on anything the authors felt was incorrect or unfair. “We embrace trying to be as civil as possible but understanding that at some point you are going to say, ‘You were wrong,’ ” Simonsohn said. “People won’t like that, no matter how you much you dress it up. It’s not something people want to hear.”

The post criticized the new paper, as well as the 2010 study. It showed Simmons and Simonsohn’s own unfavorable P-curve and essentially argued that the original published findings on hormones and risk-taking were probably a result of chance. They did not include a feelings-of-power measure in the P-curve they showed. But the blog post did mention in its last footnote that there was a significant effect of power posing on “self-reported power,” although the language made it clear that it didn’t count for much: Simmons believes that self-reports of power generally reflect what is called a demand effect — a result that occurs when subjects intuit the point of the study. Cuddy believes that studies can be constructed to minimize that risk and that demand effects are often nuanced.

Cuddy responded to Simonsohn with a few points that they incorporated into the post but said she preferred to write a longer response in a context in which she felt more comfortable.

Cuddy felt ill when Simmons and Simonsohn published the post with the headline: “Reassessing the Evidence Behind the Most Popular TED Talk.” As illustration, they used a picture of Wonder Woman. Cuddy felt as if Simmons had set them up; that they included her TED talk in the headline made it feel personal, as if they were going after her rather than the work.

The post, which Simonsohn distributed to his email list of hundreds, quickly made the rounds. “People were sending me emails like I was dying of cancer,” Cuddy says. “It was like, ‘We send our condolences,’ ‘Holy crap, this is terrible’ and ‘God bless you; we wish we could do something, but obviously we can’t.’ ” She also knew what was coming, a series of events that did, in fact, transpire over time: subsequent scrutiny of other studies she had published, insulting commentary about her work on the field’s Facebook groups, disdainful headlines about the flimsiness of her research. She paced around, distraught, afraid to look at her email, afraid not to. She had just put together a tenure package and worried that the dust-up would be a continuing distraction.

Cuddy did not like seeing her work criticized in a non-peer-reviewed format, but she wrote a bland statement saying, essentially, that she disagreed with their findings and looked forward to “more progress on this important topic.” Carney reassured Cuddy in the months after the Data Colada post that their paper would eventually be vindicated — of course the effects were real; someone would prove it eventually.

Eventually, the Data Colada post caught the eye of another influential blogger, Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, whose interest in Cuddy’s work would prove durable, exacting and possibly career-changing for Cuddy. Gelman wields his sizable influence on the field from afar, on his popular blog andrewgelman.com, where he posts his thoughts on best statistical practices in the sciences, with a frequent emphasis on what he sees as the absurd and unscientific. Gelman, who studied math and physics at M.I.T. before turning to statistics, does not believe that social psychology is any more guilty of P-hacking than, say, biology or economics. But he has devoted extensive attention to the field, especially in more recent years, in part because of the way the media has glorified social-psychology research. He is respected enough that his posts are well read; he is cutting enough that many of his critiques are enjoyed with a strong sense of schadenfreude.

Four months after the Data Colada post, Gelman, with a co-author, published an article in Slate about Carney and Cuddy’s 2010 study, calling it “tabloid fodder.” Eventually, Cuddy’s name began appearing regularly in the blog, both in his posts and in comments. Gelman’s writing on Cuddy’s study was coolly dismissive; it bothered him that Cuddy remained fairly silent on the replication and the Data Colada post. For all he knew, Cuddy was still selling the hormone effect in her speaking gigs and in her best-selling book, “Presence,” which he had not read. Had he looked, he would have been annoyed to see that Cuddy did not include a mention of the Ranehill replication. But he might have been surprised to see how little of the book focused on power posing (just a few pages).

On his site, Cuddy’s name, far from the only one he repeatedly invoked, became a go-to synecdoche for faulty science writ large. When he saw that Cuddy had been invited to speak at a conference, he wondered why the organizers had not invited a bunch of other famous figures he clearly considered bad for science, including Diederik Stapel, who had been accused of outright fraud.

His site became a home for frequently hostile comments from his followers. “She has no serious conception of ‘science,’ ” one posted. Another compared Cuddy to Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos chief executive under investigation for misleading investors. Though Gelman did encourage his readers to stick to the science, he rarely reined anyone in. In one exchange in July 2016, a commenter wrote, “I’ve wondered whether some of Amy Cuddy’s mistakes are due to the fact that she suffered severe head trauma as the result of a car accident some years ago.” Gelman replied, “A head injury hardly seems necessary to explain these mistakes,” pointing out that her adviser, Fiske, whom he has also criticized, had no such injury but made similar errors.

Gelman, whom I met in his office in late June, is not scathing in person; he is rather mild, soft-spoken even. Gelman was vague when asked if he felt there was anything unusual about the frequency of his comments on Cuddy (“People send me things, and I respond,” he said). He said it was Cuddy who was unrelenting. He later emailed me to make sure I was aware that she attacked him and Simmons and Simonsohn on a private Facebook page, without backing up her accusations with evidence; he was still waiting for a clear renunciation of the original 2010 paper on the hormonal effects of power posing. “I would like her to say: ‘Jeez, I didn’t know any better. I was doing what they told me to do. I don’t think I’m a bad person, and it didn’t get replicated’ — rather than salvaging as much as she can.”

Gelman considers himself someone who is doing others the favor of pointing out their errors, a service for which he would be grateful, he says. Cuddy considers him a bully, someone who does not believe that she is entitled to her own interpretation of the research that is her field of expertise.

Cuddy has asked herself what motivates Gelman. “Why not help social psychologists instead of attacking them on your blog?” she wondered aloud to me. “Why not come to a conference or hold a seminar?” When I asked Gelman if he would ever consider meeting with Cuddy to hash out their differences, he seemed put off by the idea of trying to persuade her, in person, that there were flaws in her work.

“I don’t like interpersonal conflict,” he said.

On Sept. 26, 2016, Amy Cuddy woke up and checked her phone to find a chilling text from a friend. “I’m so sorry,” it said. “Are you O.K.?” She felt a familiar dread, something closer to panic. For the past year, she had mostly stopped going to social-psychology conferences, feeling a chill from her community. Another social psychologist had told her that a graduate student asked if she really was friends with Cuddy. When she responded, “Yes,” the young woman asked, “Why?”

It was the kind of information Cuddy wished she did not have; her closest friends were told to stop passing on or commenting about that kind of thing, but acquaintances still did it. She felt adrift in her field. She worried about asking peers to collaborate, suspecting that they would not want to set themselves up for intense scrutiny. And she felt betrayed, not just by those who cut her down on social media, in blog posts, even in reviews (one reviewer called her “a profiteer,” not hiding his contempt), but also by some of those who did not publicly defend her. She was not wrong to think that at least in some cases, it was fear, rather than lack of support for her, that kept people from speaking up. Two tenured psychology professors at Ivy League universities acknowledged to me that they would have publicly defended some of Cuddy’s positions were they not worried about making themselves targets on Data Colada and elsewhere.

Two days before Cuddy received that text from a friend, Gelman once again posted about the power-posing research, but this time he issued a challenge to Dana Carney. “When people screw up or cheat in their research, what do their collaborators say?” he wondered in the post. For Carney, he wrote, “it was not too late.” Unknown to Cuddy and Gelman, Carney had already linked, in her C.V., to Simmon and Simonsohn’s critique of that first, influential 2010 study, but she hadn’t made the kind of statement or gesture that Gelman expected from Cuddy.

That morning of the troubling text, Cuddy logged onto her computer and discovered that Carney had posted on her website a document (then quickly published on New York magazine’s site) that seemed intended to distance its author forever, in every way, from power posing. “I do not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real,” she said. Not only had she stopped studying power poses, “I discourage others from studying power poses.”

She listed a number of methodological concerns she had, in retrospect, about the 2010 paper, most of which, Cuddy says, Carney had never raised with her. In an email a few months earlier, Carney had clearly told Cuddy that she thought the study’s data was flimsy, the sample was tiny, the effects were barely there. But Cuddy said she had never received notice that this kind of renunciation was coming. Carney declined to comment for this article, but Nelson, who is in her department, said she was clearly in a tough position, saddled with all the negatives of the work — the hit to her reputation — with none of the upside: the speaking fees and the positive feedback from teary fans who no doubt fuel Cuddy’s conviction in the research.

For much of the scientific world, Carney’s statement was an act of integrity and bravery. “Whoa! This is how to do it!” tweeted Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Toronto who had eloquently written about his own crisis of confidence about his field of research, ego depletion.

To Cuddy, Carney’s post seemed so sweeping as to be vague, self-abnegating. Even Simonsohn, who made clear his support for Carney’s decision, thought the letter had a strangely unscientific vehemence to it. “If I do a bad job proving there’s a ninth planet, I probably shouldn’t say there’s a ninth planet,” he says. “But I shouldn’t say there is no ninth planet, either. You should just ignore the bad study and go back to base line.”

Cuddy wrote a lengthy response to Carney that New York magazine published. (New York, Slate and The Atlantic have closely reported on the replication movement.) Then she stopped taking phone calls and went almost completely offline. She found that she couldn’t eat; at 5-foot-5, Cuddy went down to 100 pounds.

Less than two weeks after Carney’s disavowal, Cuddy got on a plane so she could meet her commitment to speak to a crowd of 10,000 in Las Vegas. As frail as she had been since her accident, she headed to an arena in Las Vegas and roused the crowd, a tiny woman on a giant stage, taking up space, making herself big, feeling the relief of feeling powerful.

When I emailed Joe Simmons in July and asked to meet with him, he readily agreed but warned me that he does not check his email often. “I had to take email off my phone,” he explained when we met at a coffee shop across the river from Wharton. A lot of his work these days was stressful — sometimes the emailer was angry, sometimes he was — so if he looked at his phone before bed, “that was it — I wouldn’t sleep all night.”

When Simmons and I met, I asked him why he eventually wrote such a damning blog post, when his initial correspondence with Carney did not seem particularly discouraging. He and Simonsohn, he told me, had clearly explained to Cuddy and Carney that the supporting studies they cited were problematic as a body of work — and yet all the researchers did was drop the visual graph, as if deliberately sidestepping the issue. They left in the body of literature that Simmons and Simonsohn’s P-curve discredited. That apparent disregard for contrary evidence was, Simmons said, partly what prompted them to publish the harsh blog post in the first place.

But the email that Simmons and Simonsohn had sent was, in fact, ambiguous: They had explicitly told her to drop the P-curve and yet left the impression that the paper was otherwise sound. At my request, Simmons looked back at his original email. I watched as he read it over. “Oh, yeah,” he said quietly. He had a pained look on his face. “We did say to drop the graph, didn’t we?” He read it over again, then sat back. “I didn’t remember that. This may be a big misunderstanding about — that email is too polite.”

Cuddy and Carney had taken their advice literally. Simmons stood by his analysis but recognized that there was confusion at play in how they interpreted the events that transpired. Simmons says he harbored no ill will toward Cuddy before criticizing her paper; if anything, he remembered her warmly. “She was great,” he said, smiling at the memory. “We published the blog post despite my history with Amy. Because I realized that once we pulled the trigger on this. … ” He did not finish the sentence. Cuddy had, in fact, become the poster girl for this kind of work, which even he thought was not fair. “The original study wasn’t particularly egregious,” he said. “It was published in 2010 before anyone was thinking about this.”

For a moment, the scientist allowed the human element to factor into how he felt about his email response to that paper. “I wish,” he said, “I’d had the presence of mind to pick up the phone and call Amy.”

The public nature of the attacks against Cuddy have reverberated among social psychologists, raising questions about the effects of harsh discourse on the field and particularly on women. Earlier this year at the conference of the Society of Personality and Social Psychology, there was a presentation of a 2016 survey of 700 social psychologists, assessing their perceptions of the influence of social media on their careers. The subsequent conversation on popular Facebook groups was so combative that Alison Ledgerwood, a social psychologist at the University of California, Davis, felt the need to respond in a blog post. In it, she argued that if scientists keep having hostile conversations on social media, women are more likely to be driven away from the field. (Women in the profession, the survey presented at the conference reported, participated less than their male colleagues in social-media discussions.)

Even people who believe that the methodological reforms are essential say its costs to science are real. “It’s become like politics — we’ve created two camps of people who shouldn’t be in two camps in the first place,” says Jay Van Bavel, the social psychologist at N.Y.U. “It’s perceived slights and defensiveness, and everybody has some history or grievance — and it will never end because there is that history of perceived grievances, of one of your colleagues who has been put through it, or criticized your friend in a public forum. It’s terrible for science. It’s not good.”

If Amy Cuddy is a victim, she may not seem an obvious one: She has real power, a best-selling book, a thriving speaking career. She did not own up fully to problems in her research or try to replicate her own study. (She says there were real hurdles to doing so, not least of which was finding a collaborator to take that on.) But many of her peers told me that she did not deserve the level of widespread and sometimes vicious criticism she has endured. “Amy has been the target of mockery and meanness on Facebook, on Twitter, in blog posts — I feel like, Wow, I have never seen that in science,” Van Bavel says. “I’ve only been in it for 15 years, but I’ve never seen public humiliation like that.”

As a result, the breadth of the accusations — how diffuse they are — could easily be mistaken for the depth of her scientific missteps, which at the outset were no different from those of so many of her peers. “We were all being trained to simplify, to get our message out there — there were conferences and panels on how to do it,” says Richard Petty, a social psychologist at Ohio State. “One of the ironies is that Amy just did it more successfully.”

I was surprised to find that some of the leaders in the replication movement were not Cuddy’s harshest critics but spoke of her right to defend her work in more measured tones. “Why does everyone care so much about what Amy says?” Brian Nosek says. “Science isn’t about consensus.” Cuddy was entitled to her position; the evidence in favor or against power posing would speak for itself. Leif Nelson, one of the three pioneers of the movement, says Cuddy is no different from most other scientists in her loyalty to her data. “Authors love their findings,” he says. “And you can defend almost anything — that’s the norm of science, not just in psychology.” He still considers Cuddy a “very serious psychologist”; he also believes the 2010 paper “is a bunch of nonsense.” But he says, “It does not strike me as at all notable that Amy would defend her work. Most people do.”

Every researcher has a threshold at which he or she is convinced of the evidence; in social psychology, especially, there is no such thing as absolute proof, only measures of probability. In recent months, Cuddy reached the threshold needed to alter her thinking on the effect of hormones. She mentioned, at a psychology conference where she was presenting her work, that a study had recently been conducted on power posing. “They found no hormonal effects,” she said before taking a breath. “That study is done very well, and I trust those results.” Although 11 new papers have recently been published that do not show the downstream effects of power posing on behaviors, Cuddy is still fighting for power posing. The research, she says, still shows its effect on feelings of power: At the conference, she presented a comprehensive meta-analysis, a version of which, she says, she will soon publish, with a strong P-curve supporting that, and she also presented a P-curve suggesting that power posing had a robust effect on self-evaluations, emotions and moods.

Cuddy now seems ready to move on to a new phase. We met near her home in Newton, Mass., in August. Cuddy, smiling, fresh from physical therapy for a torn ACL, was in a tennis skirt, looking young and more lighthearted than I had ever seen her. She had abandoned the dream of tenure. She was planning a new project, a new book, she told me. It was coming together in her mind: “Bullies, Bystanders and Bravehearts.” It would be personal; there would be research; she would write, and she would talk, and she would interview people who had suffered fates worse than her own and bounced back. She would tell their stories and hers, and because she is a good talker, people would listen.",When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html

The middens around Damariscotta are the largest examples north of South Carolina, said Arthur Spiess, senior archaeologist with the Maine Historic Preservation Commission.

From about 2,200 to 800 years ago, Native Americans visited this site in late winter and spring. The inhabitants discarded the shells in heaps that grew year after year, century after century.

“They were eating oysters like crazy and catching alewives,” Dr. Spiess said, referring to a type of herring.

In later centuries, European settlers viewed the middens as a resource. One company burned the oyster shells for lime; another smashed them for chicken feed.

As the shells were unearthed, however, archaeologists found ceramics, bones and stone tools, and the remains of animals on which the tribes feasted. (Many of the artifacts went to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.)

This and other middens have revealed much of what is known about Native Americans in Maine over the past 4,000 years. The best-studied site, Turner Farm, on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay, has yielded artifacts more than 5,000 years old.

The inhabitants ate shellfish, of course, mostly soft-shell clams. But they also had a taste for deer, bear, moose, porpoise and seal; cod, sturgeon and swordfish; and even extinct species like sea mink and the flightless great auk.

Donald Soctomah, the historic preservation officer for the two Passamaquoddy tribes in eastern Maine, said middens tell important stories.

“To the Passamaquoddy, the shell middens are a link to the past, and give us an idea of how life was at a certain time and what people consumed,” Dr. Soctomah said in a phone interview. “To us, any information about our past is very important, because we didn’t have a written record.”

In an effort to more rapidly assess middens, Dr. Kelley has developed protocols to survey them using ground-penetrating radar. She thinks of the surveys as a sort of triage, a way of determining which sites are at greatest risk of erosion and which are best to study. With funding from Maine Sea Grant, she has surveyed six middens so far.

“If you want to know what was in the western Gulf of Maine 3,000 years ago, this is how you’re going to figure that out,” Dr. Kelley said.

To survey a site, Dr. Kelley and graduate student Jacque Miller pushed a wheeled radar unit about the size of a jogging stroller across the area, and followed a grid pattern at a walking pace. This allowed them to map a midden without excavating in just two or three days (longer for forested or brushy sites).

The radar not only shows the extent and thickness of the middens, but also reveals the detailed layering, including what may have been floors in historic settlements.

More Reporting on Archaeology

Ms. Miller said in addition to the cultural information buried in the middens, the shells are also a record of ancient climate. Researchers can analyze them to determine historic water temperatures and salinity in the Gulf of Maine.

Still, she said, the middens do not get much attention. “A lot of people just don’t know these things exist,” said Ms. Miller. “It’s just not a focus.”

During the radar surveys, Dr. Kelley’s team had some unpleasant surprises. In one case, they arranged permission to survey a southern Maine midden that had been recorded 49 years ago. When the crew arrived with their equipment, they found it had vanished into the sea.

At the conference, Tom Dawson and Joanna Hambly of the University of St. Andrews described the Shorewatch program, which enlists citizens to monitor archaeological sites in Scotland that are threatened by coastal erosion.

Florida has developed a similar network, called Heritage Monitoring Scouts. Dr. Kelley hopes to develop such a program in Maine.

Dr. Soctomah said he keeps an eye on middens in eastern Maine. “We try to do a walk-by after a bad storm, when you are going to see a site getting more damage,” he said.

“It’s bad because they are disappearing so fast, and the knowledge that is within those middens will be washed out to sea.”",Native American Secrets Lie Buried in Huge Shell Mounds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/science/native-americans-shell-middens-maine.html

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

In public remarks on Thursday, Mr. Duterte portrayed the Islamic State as an existential threat, and defended his decision in May to declare martial law on Mindanao, the southern island that includes Marawi.

“We have to finish this or we go kaput,” Mr. Duterte said.



He said the police and the military had warned about “retaliation” from the Islamic State in the face of their defeat in Marawi.

He said of Mr. Ahmad, “He was taken this afternoon and that completes the story.”

According to analysts, Mr. Ahmad had acted as a link to the ISIS central command in Syria, helping funnel money and foreign fighters to local militants trying to seize territory in the Philippines.

Mr. Mahmud was also a close associate of Isnilon Hapilon, one of Asia’s most-wanted terrorists and the leader of Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist group linked to the Islamic State. Mr. Hapilon was killed in a gunfight with government forces on Monday along with another militant leader, Omarkhayam Maute.

After their deaths, Mr. Ahmad assumed leadership of about 30 militants still fighting government forces in Marawi.

Mr. Ahmad trained at camps run by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in the 1990s while studying at Islamabad Islamic University in Pakistan. He was a former lecturer of Islamic studies at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, one of the country’s top schools.

Analysts say Mr. Ahmad had helped organize and finance the travel of recruits from Indonesia before the Marawi siege in May to join in the fighting. The Philippine authorities have said that about 30 foreigners took part in the monthslong battle.

According to Philippine military intelligence, Mr. Ahmad also facilitated the travel of at least four Malaysians to join the Islamic State in the Middle East, including in Syria. He arrived on Mindanao, in the Philippines’ restive south, in 2014, where he sought out Mr. Hapilon and helped plan the Marawi siege and organize local terrorist cells.

A video released by the military showed him in a meeting with Mr. Hapilon and Mr. Maute as they meticulously planned the siege, which began on May 23. Mr. Ahmad reportedly funneled 30 million Philippine pesos, or about $580,000, to militants for the attack, according to intelligence officials.

Rommel Banlaoi, a terrorism expert who leads the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, said the funds went to help Mr. Hapilon’s group stockpile firearms, weapons and other logistical items for the siege.

“Mahmud, also called Abu Hanadzalah, was being sought by the Malaysian authorities for ties to global terrorists,” Mr. Banlaoi said. “He has been identified as a militant recruiter for the I.S.,” he added, using the initials of the Islamic State.

He said that among the people Mr. Ahmad had helped to go to the Middle East was Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki, who drove a car packed with bombs into an Iraqi police headquarters, killing 25 people in 2014.

While Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Hapilon may have died, there are other militant leaders waiting to emerge, Mr. Banlaoi said.

“I.S. may have lost a very valuable conduit in Mindanao with the reported death of Mahmud,” he said. “His death can severely affect financing terrorism in the region. However, threats of attacks from other terror groups remain imminent. It’s not yet over.”

More than 200,000 residents are crammed into refugee camps, waiting for the military to declare an official end to the operation.

The battle in Marawi has been financially draining and has tested the abilities of one of the region’s most poorly equipped armies. After Mr. Hapilon’s death, Mr. Duterte flew there and declared the area “liberated from terrorist influence.”","Key ISIS Operative in Philippines ‘Taken’ in Gunfight, President Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/world/asia/mahmud-ahmad-isis-philippines-marawi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

“Everyone out there thinks we’re killers, and that’s very far from the truth,” Mr. Taggart said. “They’re trying to tear us down, and saying that we’re evil. That is heartbreaking. That’s what tears me up, that they think we’re bad people.”

Mr. Cottle’s brother, Jed Cottle, said that to his horror, he immediately recognized the sound of the bump stock gunfire — slightly different from automatic fire to the trained ear — when he saw cellphone footage of the attack on the news.

He said that Slide Fire, where he and his wife used to work, breathed new life into a dying town.

“It’s kept the community going,” Jed Cottle said, extending his hands toward the football field. “Everybody shows up here on Friday night. Slide Fire has kept it going.”

He said he had not spoken to his brother in several months, and could not comment on what his brother might think about the shooting. Jeremiah Cottle did not respond to messages left for him with his employees.

“He’s upset about it, he’s lost sleep about it,” said Mr. Taggart, the mayor, who works at Slide Fire along with his wife. He described the company as a pleasant place to work, where birthdays are celebrated and many veterans and volunteer firefighters are among the employees.

The Cottle family has a history in Moran that dates back to the late 1800s. A street is named for them, and a historical marker commemorates Cottle No. 1, an oil and gas line that supplied Abilene beginning in 1908. Residents repeatedly pointed to that and to the solid reputation of Mr. Cottle’s late grandfather. They see Slide Fire as the latest chapter of the Cottles bringing jobs to Moran, and doing it with a firm grounding in something they believe in, the Second Amendment.

Mr. Martin, the county commissioner, said that residents were excited to see Slide Fire grow into a success, with new trailers moving in, a new building going up, and the frequent, rapid-fire sound of Slide Fire employees testing their products.

“It was amazing to see how his little invention turned into millions of dollars and mass production,” Mr. Martin said, recalling a visit he paid to the business before it even had office furniture. He scorned any move to ban bump stocks as an unconstitutional regulation that could wipe out dozens of local jobs.

“It’d be bad, because there’s not anything that’s around here,” he said. “Moran’s a long ways from anywhere.”

The town has no stop lights, no gas station, and only one retailer, a liquor store.

“Moran is absolutely struggling,” said Charlie Brewster, a longtime resident. “They don’t have any money. We’re fortunate to have a bank and a school.”

Mr. Brewster said banning Slide Fire products was not the answer to horrors like the Las Vegas shooting, and he was quick to link the issue to gun rights.

Many area residents scoffed at the lawsuits that have been filed against Slide Fire, and said the Las Vegas victims ought to be suing the gunman’s estate or the makers of the oversized magazines he had.

Jon Glenn, an Army veteran and rancher who lives one county away from Moran, said he bought several Slide Fire devices, found them to be great products, and regards any regulation of them as an infringement of his rights.

“This is about defending yourself from a tyrannical government,” Mr. Glenn said, standing at a gun range. “I don’t think we need any more gun laws.”

Another recreational shooter at the range chatted with him about guns in great technical detail, about tours of duty in Iraq, and about their shared disdain for gun control. On a wooden table was Mr. Glenn’s long-barreled AK-47, with a black plastic Slide Fire bump stock affixed to it so neatly that it looked like a seamless part of the weapon. Mr. Glenn turned the knob on the stock to show how it could convert the single-shot rifle to produce a torrent of continuous fire.

More than 150 people turned out for the Friday night football game, many of them lining up for Mr. Taggart’s curly fries and barbecue sandwiches. Cowboy hats were outnumbered only by baseball caps emblazoned with the team’s name, the Bulldogs, and many teenagers in the audience wore mums, the oversized corsages that are an icon of Texas culture.

The town is so small that it could only field a six-player team. At halftime, the homecoming queen was crowned with a tiara, and her king looked a bit self-conscious when a purple velvet crown was plopped on his head, but people cheered and said they were proud to keep small-town Texas traditions alive.

Mr. Martin’s son, Jeff Martin, a 2005 graduate of Moran High School, was on hand to serve as the announcer. After the home team won, he said the next move is to run a defense for Mr. Cottle.

“Jeremiah is absolutely sick over it, but we’ve come together to say, ‘No matter what happens, we’re here for you,’” the younger Mr. Martin said.

He said that blaming bump stocks for the killings in Las Vegas was like blaming a pencil for misspelled words; it’s the user that matters, he said.

Joe Brenham, a 57-year-old Moran High graduate who came from a nearby town to see the game, agreed that the community was behind the Cottles.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows.
To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?","But if the gardens are, at least to some extent, the source of some of Van Noten’s inspiration, they are also a metaphor for the daily difficulties of running an independent fashion label with the degree of autonomy and oversight that Van Noten has. As we walk through an allée of topiaried cypress, Van Noten says that he and his longtime partner in both business and life, Patrick Vangheluwe, often joke that they’ll someday write a book titled “The Depressed Gardener,” about all the things that can go wrong in a garden, no matter the allowances made for changing climates, unpredictable weather, rapacious insects and on and on. You plan and plan, he says, and something always goes awry anyway. The depressed gardener knows that. He also knows, however, that it is simply what happens when you try to control what cannot be controlled — to be a depressed gardener is to live in a state of constant humility. But it also means a heightened ability to appreciate the strange gifts that circumstance sometimes affords. It means living a life of unknowns, large and small, and yet never ceasing in one’s attempts to coax beauty from even the most forbidding, the meanest of places: the spots of earth that everyone else has overlooked.

TRYING TO EXPLAIN the fever that Van Noten’s clothes induce to someone who’s never seen them is an unsatisfying task, because they in many ways defy what we’ve been taught to admire in contemporary fashion. You don’t, for example, buy a Dries Van Noten dress or shirt or skirt simply for its cut: The shapes, some of which appear season after season, are conventionally feminine and invariably flattering, smartly crafted and architecturally sound. A Dries Van Noten midi-length dress will always be draped in just the right way, so that it allows the illusion of a waist without actually defining it; a Dries Van Noten skirt, a straight sheath of lightweight silk, will always be slim enough to just skim over the hips, but not so slim that it impedes movement. But they are never transgressive, and they are not invitations to reconsider the female form. Cutouts, extreme dimensions, shoulder pads, extravagant volume — you will rarely find these in a Van Noten garment.

And yet in a strange way, Van Noten’s closest peer might be his apparent opposite, Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, whom the designer admires and who is, like Van Noten, a member of the very tiny 100-percenter club, internationally recognized fashion designers who own and oversee virtually every aspect of their businesses. (Other members include Giorgio Armani and Raf Simons.) Not aesthetically, of course — Kawakubo’s work is consistently, defiantly avant-garde — but what defines both of their work is an inimitable perspective, a refusal to concede to trends or whims. Their work is instantly recognizable as their own, and because the pieces they produce originate from a single mind, a single vision, they are almost impossible to copy or duplicate (not well, anyway) — a Dries Van Noten piece will never be mistaken for anyone else’s. Fashion, these days, is often meant to stand for something — it is meant to disrupt, to challenge (sometimes literally), it is increasingly expected to have a political statement to share; Van Noten’s fashion, however, stands for nothing but itself, and for the obsessions of the man who created it. It is cool instead of hot; it encourages interiority instead of provocation. In an age that rewards the person who can shout the loudest, the truly radical act is the embrace of the subtle.

Van Noten’s great gift is color. No living designer understands it as well as he does; no other designer has such a rich vocabulary of tone and hue that certain shades, once seen, are impossible to associate with anything other than his clothes. Dior may have had his New Look; Van Noten has a particular blue: brighter than indigo, blacker than a cornflower, deeper than the Pacific. There is also a Dries Van Noten yellow (a rich, yolky marigold); a Dries Van Noten green (the gleaming, dense color of an emerald placed on a square of dark velvet); a Dries Van Noten red (cinnabar-ish and slightly chalky) and a Dries Van Noten purple (a dusty eggplant). But it’s not just the colors themselves that make Van Noten’s clothes so memorable, so resonant; it’s what he does with them, forcing them into strange relationships and juxtapositions that, if you encountered them only as words — persimmon and seashell; compost and moss — might sound unlikely, even occasionally unpleasant. In reality, though, the couplings are revelatory, so effortless that they ask you to reassess the limited way we’ve been encouraged to see color in the first place — why, after all, can’t iris purple pair with camel? Why can’t dulce de leche brown coexist with kelp blue?

Every one of Van Noten’s shows force these reconsiderations, but my favorite is probably his fall 2009 ready-to-wear women’s collection, which appeared, if you blurred your vision a bit, as a series of tonal, Rothkoesque blocks, each hue dyed to just the point where it almost became some other color altogether: a claret-y red-purple sweater above a lichen-y blue-green skirt; a peachy pink-orange skirt worn beneath a grassy gold-green shirt. The clothes in that collection were lovely for other reasons, too — there were sharp, cinch-waisted coats and slouchy, insouciant sweaters (a Van Noten specialty) and a skirt made of soft tiers of shirred and frayed silk that seemed to float in the air like milkweed fluff — but it was dominated by an abstraction, the suggestion that fashion might be not just about how a garment feels on the skin or how it intimates the figure beneath, but about how it tries to express and make sense of color: the natural world’s most enduring, bewitching and elusive bestowment.

We have grown used to speaking of designers as loving a woman’s body — this usually means that they either make clothes that are very sculpting, or clothes that are deliberately unsculpting — but Van Noten’s clothes seem made not so much for a woman’s body as for a woman’s mind: You are drawn to his work because you want to find yourself closer to the person who, you imagine, shuts his eyes and sees such a glorious jumble of color.

ALONG WITH COLOR, Van Noten also has an unrivaled sense of pattern. The designs that ornament his clothes allude to everything from Qing Dynasty decorations and the paintings of Francis Bacon to Ottoman-era iconography and the artist James Reeve’s photographs of cities at night. All designers take from cultures and periods and artists foreign to their own experience, of course, but too often, their tributes feel costume-y, suggesting an invented passion rather than a real one. Van Noten’s borrowings are less literal than they are gestural — yes, the pieces in his fall 2012 collection were covered with stylized Chinese dragons and phoenixes (rendered in a vivid, imperial saffron), but they were pieced alongside shimmering stripes of vermilion and jade of the sort that adorn the canopies of tantric Buddhist temples in Nepal, and Japanese cranes stitched in gold and frozen in midflight. The difference between a designer and a copyist is that a designer makes his source material into something else, something his own; he doesn’t just present it, unchanged and unsynthesized, as work he’s created himself.

Curiously, it is in his wide-ranging eye, in his knowledge of textile and artistic traditions from the world’s great civilizations, that Van Noten announces himself as Flemish. Designers these days rarely work where they were born or became adults — to be in fashion now is to exchange actual citizenship for the parallel universe in which the industry operates, a universe consisting of Milan, Paris, London, New York and maybe Tokyo — and yet Van Noten, who is as well-traveled as any of his peers, continues to reside and work in Antwerp, where he was born, raised and educated. (His current estate, Ringenhof, an 1840s neo-Classical stone house built for a local beer brewer, is a peaceful 30-minute drive from the city center.) When Van Noten was a child, Antwerp was mostly a quiet, bourgeois town, and yet fashion, the idea of it, wasn’t an impossible concept for him. His father, himself descended from a family of tailors, owned several boutiques and made regular trips to Milan and Paris to buy polite, well-constructed Italian and French wares: shoes from Ferragamo, shirts from Charvet. As a teenager, Van Noten acted as the buyer for the children’s department. The stores would occasionally host Saturday-afternoon shows, local models spinning through the space while wearing the season’s new offerings. In making their lives in textiles, in fabrics, in goods from all the countries and cultures surrounding tiny Belgium, the family was following in the Lowlands’ centuries-long legacy of trade, joining the generations of burghers who let their fingertips trace over foreign silks and foreign wools, who measured foreign dyes and foreign powders. If you were a wealthy 13th-century merchant in Bruges, 60 miles west of Antwerp, you would, in a real way, spend your lifetime encountering patterns and colors from lands you could only imagine through their material goods; wonderment would be in your blood. To be Flemish — as Van Noten adamantly is — was to spend your life looking outward and beyond.

This perspective may explain in part why the arrival of the so-called Antwerp Six — a group of early ’80s graduates of the fashion school at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts that included Van Noten, Ann Demeulemeester and Walter Van Beirendonck, who together mounted a now-legendary, semi-guerrilla-style show in London in 1986 — was more a surprise to the rest of the world than to the participants themselves. (Martin Margiela is a contemporary of the Antwerp Six, though he wasn’t part of that initial presentation.) Van Noten crossed into adulthood in the 1970s, in the early years of modern cultural globalization, when ideas and aesthetics and music and art traveled faster and farther than ever before in human history. You could be an adolescent in Antwerp and hear punk music from London or West Berlin, and suddenly you would understand that someone out there was creating something that you could be a part of, that you could participate in, that seemed to communicate directly to you. You were seeing images in magazines and on television of people your age or a little older or a little younger doing things that you too might be able to do, and it was transfixing, transformative. For Van Noten, that person was David Bowie, and years later, he paid homage to him — his narrow, bladelike suits, his languor and loucheness — again and again. And it wasn’t just in fashion: All over, in countries both free and not, young people were realizing that what might unite them wasn’t family or heritage or nation, it was music or art or theater or film. They were creating the new wave, the avant-garde, but they had begun doing so as a way of seeking some sort of greater connection — as a way to reach somebody else.

AFTER THE LONDON SHOW, Van Noten returned home and started selling. He had begun his business in men’s wear, and one of his first (and most enduring) clients, Barneys New York, had simply bought the smallest sizes from his collection and sold them as women’s wear. Three years later, in 1989, he moved his small boutique into a five-floor former department store in a run-down section of town and began in earnest the business of being a fashion designer.

He never stopped. Absent from Van Noten’s three-decade career are stories of bankruptcy, strife, irresponsibility, overleverage, overexpansion, overspending or unhinged, dangerous effulgence. He worked slowly and carefully; he did only what he wanted to, when he wanted to. Along the way, there were challenges (global recessions, a luxury market that grew ever more fickle, trends and fads and gimmicks to withstand) and triumphs: a women’s boutique in Paris in 2007; a second in Tokyo and a men’s wear boutique in Paris in 2009; a sumptuous exhibition, “Inspirations,” one of the few granted to a living designer, at Paris’s Musée des Arts Décoratifs in 2014. But what remained constant was Van Noten’s discipline, his aversion to self-indulgence, to folly, his adherence to a rigor that announces itself in his designs and in his conduct: a sense of discipline that, paradoxically, has earned him extraordinary artistic freedom. He has to make compromises — every creative person does, in one way or another — but he rarely has to make concessions. Today, he controls every element of his business. (He collaborates on the line’s shoes with a manufacturer.) He will tell you, without apology, that he wants his clothes to sell; that he makes his clothes to sell. His business, its longevity and health, is a reminder that one of the most seductive fictions of fashion is that it exists as a pure aesthetic expression — and yet those who believe this are those who disappear after a year or five, comets whose tails fade quickly into the glittering black.

A visit to Van Noten’s offices, now headquartered in a 60,000-square-foot, six-floor waterfront warehouse, recalls in many ways a visit to his gardens: Here is Van Noten’s other world, or a continuation of it, the place where he executes those ideas, those images, those strange colors he imagines while strolling among Ringenhof’s hollyhocks and smoke trees. If you begin at the top floor showroom and work downward, you can see the entire operation unfold before you, from the design team’s desks, some fitted with a little cabinet stuffed with scraps of deliciously colored swatches of silks, jacquards, wools, jerseys and cottons, and continuing down through the financial department, the sales department, the production and distribution departments and the archives. But it is the ground floor — the shipping department — that is somehow both the most moving and most impressive. When I visited, the first deliveries of the fall collection were arriving. Each garment is sorted, inspected and then boxed. Van Noten wandered through the maze of boxes — stacked several high, almost scraping the ceilings — pointing out which was going to Moscow, which to Hong Kong, which to Singapore, which to New York; along with eight boutiques, the collection is sold in more than 400 stores worldwide. He appeared, in those moments, a touch bewildered — or maybe simply awe-struck. It was a Willy Wonka kind of fantasy, to stand in a building in your hometown among hundreds of cartons packed with things you had dreamed up, all of them destined for places that you might never have imagined visiting as a child growing up not far from here, but now would be worn by people you would never meet in lands your ancestors would never have been able to see for themselves.

By now it was time for lunch, which would be served in the studio. Back upstairs we entered a high-ceilinged, near-empty room, where the page proofs of one of the designer’s upcoming books, a career survey, were laid on the ground. Last March, in Paris, Van Noten mounted his hundredth show, a joyous anthology of his signature, most Dries-like patterns and textures from across the years, many worn by some of his earliest models, now mostly in their late 40s. It was a reminder of the totality, the singularity of his vision, of how each season is in conversation with the last, of how, when you see a Dries Van Noten collection, you are seeing the latest installment in the sartorial equivalent of what the novelist David Mitchell calls an “über-book”: All of his works (in Mitchell’s case, fiction; in Van Noten’s case, fashion) are part of some grander mosaic that is visible only to its creator, and yet, equally, are revealing of some invisible part of its creator’s mind. This is why you can wear a Dries Van Noten dress or shift or skirt from any season at anytime, and although fellow members of the Van Noten tribe will recognize it as his, it will always look relevant, and surprising — a chapter in a book you love, but not one that is immediately nameable.

Here, at our feet, were images from every season, every collection Van Noten has ever designed, all arranged in neat rows. Here was the Turkish-inflected fall 2006 collection, with its patterns of Mughal-esque tulips, blown up exaggeratedly large, and the India-inspired fall 1996 show with its translucent, shocking chartreuse blouses and fragile, sparkling, sari-like column skirts. Together, we ambled up one row and then down another, looking at the photos at our feet, bursts of color against the cool cement. I asked him the lazy question you should never ask any artist — did he have a favorite look, a favorite show? — and he, like most artists, demurred. But then he corrected himself: Most of the collections were represented by only six pages, he said; if he really liked them, he might have devoted eight to them, or 10, or even 14. Once again, we began to move, counting the pages, calling out to each other — 10! 12! — and pausing at particularly striking works: a chiffon and burnt velvet caftan, a men’s coat so heavy with embroidery it resembled armor. If every life is a collection of images, too many to process and too many to remember, then this book was, in a real way, his life, or part of it, anyway: a beautiful life, one perfect in its wholeness and conception. To see the world as Dries Van Noten does — what would that be like?

We stopped before a picture of one of my favorite dresses, a gently draped silk sheath, its top a pattern of slashy lilac dashes against a bark-colored background; its bottom an almost Impressionistic blur of blue irises. I remembered this collection, this piece: It was from spring 2008, and I didn’t have the money to buy it. I would go to the store and try it on, and then I would have to leave it behind.

“This is one of the most gorgeous things I’ve seen,” I said.

Artists, no matter how well they might learn to project otherwise, are rarely humble people. Or rather, they are and they aren’t — to be an artist is, often, to live in the thin, unhappy space between arrogance and self-hatred, with one word tipping you over the line in one direction or another. Maybe that’s not the case for Van Noten, who doesn’t brag, doesn’t boast. But for a few seconds, he didn’t speak. His handsome face twitched into a suggestion of a frown. He stared at the dress as he’d stared at that rose, that rose that had so surprised him.

“A beautiful dress,” I repeated. He continued looking at the picture of that dress on the ground before us, something so lovely — the dull shimmer of the silk, the Dries Van Noten blue of the flowers — that not even he could claim otherwise. Sometimes, even the Depressed Gardener’s only move is to surrender to the enchantment of the thing before him.

It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work — and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake “much more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,” his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.

He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.

Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake’s father wrote: “Jake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.” A week later, though, Jake couldn’t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse’s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. “It was the depth of hell,” his mother told me.

That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake’s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase — to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 — of undergraduates reporting “overwhelming anxiety” in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they “felt overwhelmed by all I had to do” during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.

Those numbers — combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall — come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it’s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they’re seeing can’t easily be explained away. “We’ve always had kids who didn’t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,” says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. “But there’s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.”

For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)

Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing — and learning to talk back to — their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That’s an easy exercise for anxious young people (“Only three?” one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a “strong and powerful response” to each negative thought.

She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.

Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. “I’m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,” Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, “then I’ll get a bad grade in the class, I won’t get into the college I want, I won’t get a good job and I’ll be a total failure.”

At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake’s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn’t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down — and that his value as a person didn’t depend on where he went to school.

Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn’t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.

Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn’t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.

Jillian listened as Jake and other peers — who, in reality, liked her very much — voiced her insecurities: “I can’t believe how insignificant Jillian is.” “I mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.” “If she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn’t even miss her.”

At the last one, Jillian’s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. “I don’t want to do this,” she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.

“If it’s too much, you can stop,” the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. “No, I feel like I need to do this,” she announced. “I have a week and a half left. If I can’t get through something like this here ...”

Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing — and much less forgiving.

Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.

“Anxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,” explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.

But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center’s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: “The overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.”

“The fears can be very real for our kids,” explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic’s medical director. “Oftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there’s a history of trauma and abuse.” The contemporary political climate can also feel “incredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,” Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.

And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who “act out” are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves — anxiety specialists call them “silent sufferers” — are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. “If you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,” Kendall says. “When you start to talk about anxiety, they’re like, ‘Oh, those are the kids we like!’ ”

Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. “These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,” she says, but there’s “contempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.”

Photo

For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they “never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop,’ ” Luthar says. “There’s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.”

It’s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. “Teenagers used to tell me, ‘I just need to get my parents off my back,’ ” recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. “Now so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.”

Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there’s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. “They wonder about whether it’s safe to go to a movie theater,” she said.

When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn’t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.

Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits — round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers — were partly to blame for their children’s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation’s relationship to social media. “I don’t think we realize how much it’s affecting our moods and personalities,” he said. “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without but that’s making us crazy.”

In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. “In high school, I’d constantly be judging my self-worth online,” he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. “I would think, Oh, people don’t want to see me on their timeline.”

While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. “It was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,” he said. Jake’s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.

At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the “illusion of control and certainty” that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. “Teens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who’s checked in online,” Ashworth told the parents. “But life doesn’t always come with that kind of certainty, and they’re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.”

Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn’t much evidence for it,” she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is “all wrong,” she said. “The economy was improving by the time the increase started.”

The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines — depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book “iGen,” and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. “The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told me. “It’s enough for an arrest — and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.”

Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. “We’re not getting the job done,” she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.

More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. “We don’t have to convince them anymore,” she told me. “Schools are coming to us, eager for help.”

A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety “the cult leader” — for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves — and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. “Anxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,” Lyons explained. “When we play along, we don’t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.”

She pointed to the increasing use of “504 plans,” a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door — to avoid the chaos of the main entrance — and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.

Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are “avoidance-based and teach zero skills.” She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager “can go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,” she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student “externalize his worry,” similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.

“If anxiety could talk, it would say, ‘You know, let’s just get out of here. We don’t have to do this!’ ” Lyons said from the stage. “But in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I’m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they’re so frail, like they can’t handle things.”

Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces — and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. “Kids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can’t handle being triggered, that they shouldn’t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,” she told me.

Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word — “resiliency” — kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren’t “equipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,” a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety — and as more of those “stop coming to school, because they just can’t.”

Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called “our more fragile students.” At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream.” These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck — not that anyone was keeping score.

I couldn’t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs’ teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?

“Some will say that this feeds the monster,” concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. “But you’ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We’ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don’t come to school if they have to spend all day in” general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury’s regular classes — and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.

Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program’s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program’s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to “sacrifice the anxious kid” in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.

Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. “What’s the issue today?” I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a “Hail Mary,” as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone “right next to his face,” he rarely responds when he’s feeling anxious. “I appreciate you picking up — you don’t normally do that,” Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.

Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to “hide from, control and avoid” their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.

Critelli looked at him incredulously. “Dude, you’re failing physics,” Critelli said. “What do you mean you don’t have anything to do?”

“There’s nothing I can do — I’m going to fail,” the student mumbled.

“So you’re just accepting that you’re going to fail?” The boy looked at his hands. “Here’s an idea,” Critelli continued. “You can email your teacher and say, ‘What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?’ ”

Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. “I’d love to see you advocate for yourselves!”

Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school — on some days he “even enjoyed it,” he told me with a laugh.

While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. “That was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn’t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,” he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.

Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.

In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had “aced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.” But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. “Just being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,” he wrote. “College is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.”

The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn’t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a “Walking Dead” costume contest at a local car dealership.

While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series “13 Reasons Why” on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series’s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. “I’d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,” she said. “Most of them were like, ‘Just kill yourself.’ ”

Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn’t want to open up and be known as “the anxious girl.” There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression — “It’s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,” the headmaster told me — but Jillian didn’t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and “I don’t want to go backward,” she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.

Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. “There’s feeling a weight on your chest, and there’s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,” she said. “As soon as I’d wake up, it was absolute dread.”

Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother — who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support — could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn’t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn’t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was “manipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn’t feel like doing,” she said.

“The million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she’s going to have a panic attack?” Allison told me. “I feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.”

Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents’ workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.

He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children’s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they’ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they’re afraid to. “So many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,” Ashworth said.

While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a “let’s not take life — and ourselves — too seriously” approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, “you’ve just made his day,” Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.

Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn’t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn’t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. “We basically said, ‘O.K., anxiety, you win.’ ”

Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. “I’m just a lot more relaxed now,” she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with “Star Wars” posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of “Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.” Near her bed were two prescription bottles — one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be “a lot worse if I wasn’t taking them.”

Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule — including yoga, studying and cleaning her room — that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at “Star Wars” conventions or on social media.

At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.

“O.K., I’m going to go mingle,” she announced.

On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read “Ask Me About My Anxiety” and “I Have OCD.” They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, “You must be a Dartmouth football player.” Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.

“What do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?” McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.

But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. “We’re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,” says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. “And when we do give them therapy, it’s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we’re not treating people with what actually works best.”

Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren’t typically eager to feel more anxious. “It’s also uncomfortable for many therapists,” Whiteside told me. “Most people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you’re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It’s not much fun for anybody. It’s much easier to sit in a therapist’s office and talk about feelings.”

Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That’s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers’ anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist’s office.

For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.

Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, “Can I tell you about anxiety?” More than a few students — including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player — responded with some version of “Trust me, I know all about it.”

The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. “Can I just sit on the bench for a minute?” he asked Randolph. “And can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, ‘Do you mind if I sit there?’ It’s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.”

“Even better — let’s make it weird,” Randolph told him.

The boy shook his head. “Maybe the guy’s on break and doesn’t want to be bothered.”

“Maybe,” Randolph said. “He might hate you. He might get real mad at you.”

“That’s terrifying,” the teenager confessed. “And what if we’re so close on the bench that we’re touching?”

“That would be awkward,” Randolph said with a half-smile.

The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. “Is he sitting in the middle of the bench?”

“I don’t know — he might be,” Randolph told him. “But are you going to ‘what if’ this to death, or are you going to do it?”

He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: “I’ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.” The “Ask Me” was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including “B*tch,” “F*ggot,” “Ur Fat” and “Kill Yourself.” Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas’s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.

Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas’s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.

Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. “Oh, my God, that was the greatest,” Thomas announced upon his return.

I asked him what they’d talked about. “The muscular dude said he’s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,” Thomas told us. “Then the girl said, ‘You’re really brave. Can I give you a hug?’ ”

“That’s not what you were expecting, huh?” Randolph said. “Instead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.”

“Yeah, it was awesome,” he said. “I feel so good!”

The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: “It was sooooo awkward,” he reported. “The guy just kept texting. He was probably like, Why is this kid asking me questions?”

“And what if he was?” Randolph asked him. “You’re not responsible for what he’s thinking.”

The boy appeared to consider Randolph’s point as they made their way back to the van that would return them to Mountain Valley. Sometimes, Randolph told the boys, “exactly what you think will happen happens. Other times, the exact opposite of what you think will happen happens. Either way, it’s all manageable.”

The subject line of Jake’s email to me last winter read simply, “College Results.” I opened it: “Hey Benoit, I just wanted to tell you that I was accepted to U.N.C. Chapel Hill. Jake.” I emailed back to say that he could stand to sound a little bit more excited, to which he replied, “Trust me, I’m pretty excited!”

Last month, I visited him during his fourth week of college classes. It was a Sunday, and Jake met me outside his dorm wearing khaki shorts and a Carolina Panthers jersey. He looked happier than I’d ever seen him. “Let’s walk,” he said, leading me on a tour of campus and nearby Chapel Hill, where he went record shopping (he left with a Parquet Courts album) and played touch football with a few of his friends.

Since leaving Mountain Valley, Jake had prioritized his social life. “The health of my relationships with people is just as important as academics,” he told me on a bench overlooking the main quad. He had said something similar at Mountain Valley, but back then it sounded theoretical, aspirational. It felt true now. He had made new friends on campus and was keeping up with old ones from home — and some of his peers from Mountain Valley — via text and Snapchat, the only social-media platform he regularly uses these days. “My junior year, when things got really bad, I told myself that I didn’t need to hang out with my friends a lot, that all that really mattered was how well I did at school,” he said. “I don’t think like that anymore.”

That’s not to say that Jake doesn’t study. He does — usually days before he needs to. “Procrastination isn’t a good idea for me,” he said. But he was actually enjoying several of his college classes, especially Intro to Ethics, for which he was reading Plato’s “Republic.”

Jake had experienced only one intense bout of anxiety at U.N.C. For his info sciences course, he turned in an assignment online but realized days later that there had been a technical glitch and it hadn’t gone through. He said he felt “a sudden burst of anxiety” — his chest tightened, and adrenaline coursed through his body. What had he done? He sent a panicked email to his professor and told a friend who also has anxiety issues that he was “freaking out.” Then he took a nap, which had long been one of his coping strategies. When he awoke, the professor had emailed saying it wasn’t a big deal. “That ended that crisis,” Jake told me.

For the most part, Jake felt he was managing his anxiety. Over the summer, he met twice with Jonathan Abramowitz, a psychology professor who leads the university’s anxiety and stress lab, but Jake had put off finding a regular therapist for the school year. His parents kept bugging him about it. “I just haven’t felt like I need it here,” Jake told me. But then, a few beats later, he added: “I know I need to stop making excuses and just do it.”

I was curious how much of Jake’s newfound contentment had to do with being at U.N.C., with getting into his dream school. After all, a major component of his treatment at Mountain Valley was learning to accept that his value didn’t depend solely on academic achievement. How would he have reacted if his application was one of the 74 percent that U.N.C. rejected last year?

It was clear that Jake had thought about the question. “I would have been disappointed, but I really think I would have been O.K.,” he told me. “There are other schools in the world where I would have been happy. I definitely wouldn’t have believed that a couple years ago, but a lot’s changed.”

Before walking back to his dorm, where Jake’s friends were waiting for him, we stopped at the Old Well, a campus landmark where legend has it that students who drink from it on the first day of classes will get straight A’s that semester. The old Jake might have been first in line. But the new Jake? He hadn’t bothered to show up.",Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering From Severe Anxiety?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/magazine/why-are-more-american-teenagers-than-ever-suffering-from-severe-anxiety.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“He has gone deep into the emojis,” Barbara said. In her contacts he’s identified as Popsicle. In Jenna’s he’s Jefe, which is Spanish for “boss.”

We only think we know the people who wind up, intentionally or not, in the spotlight. We categorize them. Trivialize them. That’s maybe the main plaint and preoccupation of a joint memoir, “Sisters First,” in which Jenna and Barbara each present reminiscences that alternate with the other’s. It will be published on Tuesday.

“What we wanted to write about in the book was the nuance of people that we love,” Barbara said, and they’ve done just that, charting the distance between public image and private reality. The stories that they tell are often self-serving, and they skim over the failures and wages of their father’s presidency. But they do make you question the caricatures that we blithely traffic in, the assumptions that we breezily make and our reluctance to allow for how much the objects of our curiosity can change.

Their father’s late-blooming obsession with painting: Even they didn’t see that one coming. He skipped the trips to art museums that their mother, Laura, took them on when they were kids.

But after his presidency ended in 2009, he got an iPhone, Barbara said, and “discovered this little drawing app and would do little sketches and send them to us.”

Jenna added: “We would say, ‘Hey, Dad, Happy Sunday, what are you up to?’ And he would stick-figure a little airplane.”

“With his little face waving out of it,” Barbara chimed in. That meant that he was flying somewhere.

The book is stippled with insider anecdotes, my favorite of which recounts a meal that Barbara and her mother shared with Silvio Berlusconi in 2006, when he was Italy’s prime minister and Barbara was 24. (She and Jenna are now 35.) Berlusconi complimented her on her blue eyes, told her that she should mate with his son and, for good measure, announced: “If I was younger, I’d have children with you.” Barbara’s loss, obviously, but she has somehow soldiered on.

I told her that when I read that part, I immediately thought of Trump, and of his various comments over the years about the hotness — in Daddy’s eyes — of Ivanka. She didn’t take the bait.

They’re careful, she and Jenna. They have made clear over the years that they’re not perfect political overlaps with the rest of their family, which is the Republican Party’s great modern dynasty. Barbara, for example, appeared in a video endorsing same-sex marriage back in 2011.

But that’s not the kind of attention they usually court, and during our hours together at Café Altro Paradiso, where Jenna had ricotta dumplings and Barbara swordfish, they repeatedly registered their disgust with the divisiveness of our national conversation. They don’t want to add to the ugliness, which pains Jenna all the more, she said, because she has two daughters, Mila, 4, and Poppy, 2.

“This moment, as a mother, feels a little frightening, because I’m nervous to have the TV on to hear some of the rhetoric that is coming from the highest position,” Jenna said, conspicuously not uttering the syllable “Trump” itself. “The way I speak about elections and the way I speak about everything has changed, because I’m now a role model to two little humans who I want to teach about love and empathy and compassion.”

She and Barbara, who is single, woke up together in Jenna’s bed on the morning after election night, because Jenna’s husband, Henry Hager, was away, and Barbara had come over to watch the returns, which were still being counted into the wee hours. Jenna wouldn’t say if those results disappointed her, but she and Barbara both expressed a fierce wish to see a female president soon.

“One hundred percent,” Jenna said, and again mentioned her girls. “Mila, the other day in the car, goes, ‘Mommy, Poppy rules the world,’ about her baby sister. And I go: ‘Well, Poppy could rule the world. Maybe one day she could be president.’ And Mila goes, ‘But, Mom, presidents are men.’ She said that.”

From mid-1999 to late-2001 I covered their father’s campaign and the start of his presidency, and I remember seeing them on the fringes of events. I also remember the media’s sometimes cheap fascination with them when they went off to college — Jenna to the University of Texas, Barbara to Yale — and were repeatedly caught consuming alcohol before they were legally old enough to.

“Jenna and Tonic” was a headline in The New York Post. People magazine went with “Double Trouble,” while Newsweek opted for “Busted Again in Margaritaville.” They were embarrassed, yes, but also frustrated by what they insist were exaggerations in many accounts.

Back then I was never formally introduced to either of them. But perhaps five years ago, Barbara visited me at The Times to discuss the Global Health Corps, a public-health analogue to the Peace Corps and Teach for America that sends more than 100 recent college graduates annually into the most impoverished areas of the world. She founded it, raised money for it, is its chief executive and spends plenty of time in those places herself.

Partly because of her focus on health but largely to stir up trouble, I asked her and Jenna, whom I was meeting for the first time, about Trump’s move to make it easier for employers to deny coverage of birth control. He’d announced that just hours before our lunch.

“It does feel like we’re going backwards in some ways,” Jenna said, “and that’s probably as much as I can say.”

Is she pro-choice?

“I can’t say,” she answered. “I’d be in trouble at work.”

Barbara?

“I am very for women having everything they need to live healthy, dignified lives,” she told me.

“Is that a yes?” I asked.

“I think women should be able to make the right decision that would allow them to live — truly allow them to live,” she said.

Jenna shook her head: “He might have wanted a yes or no.” Indeed he might have.

Their father opposed abortion rights but their mother stayed mum, vaguely identifying herself as pro-choice only after the couple left the White House. That approximated the trajectory of her mother-in-law, the former first lady Barbara Bush, who pops up frequently in “Sisters First” and, like the rest of the clan, isn’t exactly who you expect.

Regal? Entitled? Not according to the account of the twins’ visit to the White House shortly after the first President Bush’s election, when they were 7. They discovered the bowling lane in the basement and, using the phone there, asked a staffer to bring them peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

“We were like Eloise in our Plaza!” Jenna writes. “When the door opened, it was not our sandwiches, but our Ganny, who appeared and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not in a hotel, but temporary guests in a historic home, and we were never to do that again.”

Laura Bush is “quiet and bookish,” Barbara writes, but then again not: “Beneath her flats and cardigans, my mom is in fact our closet hippie and Rastafarian.” She dragged Barbara, then a teenager, to a reggae concert in Austin, Tex.

Barbara also writes that while her father can be “loud and unthoughtful,” he “outreads us all.” After Barbara went through her first devastating romantic breakup a few years ago, he called or texted her daily, “just to check in, just to share the burden with me.”

The twins portray him as surprisingly self-effacing.

During his presidency, they spotted an anti-Bush bumper sticker with a withering put-down, and they not only told him about it but turned it into a running family joke. “Now,” Barbara writes, “this line comes up regularly when we want to rib our former-leader-of-the-free-world father: ‘Well, somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot.’ ”

After Jenna, covering the Golden Globes for NBC, conflated two movies about African-Americans by referring to “Hidden Fences,” he quickly texted her to remind her that where verbal pratfalls were concerned, he’d been there, done that and survived. She would, too.

Jenna and Barbara told me that for as long as they can remember, he has brought their mother coffee in bed every morning, including when he was in the White House, because he’s always up first. He brings them coffee in bed when they visit.

They seemed to me a long, long way from Margaritaville. They’re not the Manhattan party fixtures they could easily be. They show considerable restraint. They also show generosity.

Back in January, as Malia and Sasha Obama prepared to move out of the White House, Jenna and Barbara wrote them a letter that acknowledged the challenges that they’d already faced and that they would continue to confront, including “harsh criticism of your parents by people who had never even met them.”

The appearance came after Mr. Trump and the White House were consumed by criticism after the president’s actions this week — first appearing to criticize former presidents for failing to call the families of fallen service members and later for the words Mr. Trump chose to use in speaking with the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson.

Mr. Kelly defended Mr. Trump by offering a detailed, even excruciating description of what happens to those killed in combat, including how the remains are packed in ice for the flights back to the United States. He testified to the deep pain that parents feel when they get an early-morning knock on the door from an official there to tell them that their son or daughter has been killed in action.

“The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

He said that presidents often are not among those who call family members directly, and he confirmed what Mr. Trump had alluded to publicly this week: that former President Barack Obama had not called him after Lieutenant Kelly was killed.

“That was not a criticism, that was simply to say I don’t believe President Obama called,” Mr. Kelly said, adding that President George W. Bush and other presidents did not always make personal phone calls to family members. He said Lieutenant Kelly’s friends in Afghanistan called him in the hours after his son died.

“Those were the only phone calls that really matter,” Mr. Kelly said. “Yeah, the letters count to a degree. But there’s not much that can take the edge off.”

The controversy over Mr. Trump’s remarks began even before he made the calls to the families, when former Obama administration officials took offense at the suggestion that Mr. Obama had not done as much as Mr. Trump to pay honor to the fallen.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump did not intend that to be a criticism of his predecessor, but rather was repeating what Mr. Kelly had briefed him on before he got the question at an impromptu news conference on Monday in the Rose Garden.

Mr. Kelly expressed frustration and even anger at the fact that the conversation between Mr. Trump and Sergeant Johnson’s widow was exposed to the world by Ms. Wilson, a friend of the family, who was in the car with the family when the president’s call came in.

“I thought at least that was sacred,” Mr. Kelly said, expressing dismay at other aspects of society that were no longer sacred, including women, religion and Gold Star families.

Ms. Wilson had publicized her criticism of Mr. Trump’s call, saying that the president had told Sergeant Johnson’s widow that he “knew what he signed up for,” and that the family was offended by Mr. Trump’s words.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had tried, in the call, to express what Mr. Kelly had talked to him about ahead of time — that people like her husband were doing what they loved, and what they had chosen to do, when they were killed serving the country.

“That’s what the president tried to say to four families,” Mr. Kelly said.

Mr. Kelly said that he was so upset on Wednesday that he went to the cemetery to walk among the service members who had died fighting for the country.

Even before the disastrous imposition of collective farming, Russia’s new rulers “once again followed the precedent set by the czars,” Applebaum writes; “they banned Ukrainian newspapers, stopped the use of Ukrainian in schools and shut down Ukrainian theaters.” By the mid-1920s, once Soviet power had been firmly established, the regime tried a new policy, as it did in other non-Russian parts of the Soviet Union, giving official status to the Ukrainian language and allowing the production of a definitive Ukrainian-Russian dictionary.

But rather than making the Ukrainians into happy Soviets, this period of limited tolerance only produced more demands for Ukrainian-language schools for the nearly eight million ethnic Ukrainians living in Russia itself, and for Ukrainian border expansions to include some of those ethnic communities. An alarmed Kremlin quickly reversed course.

The end of the 1920s saw a crackdown on the Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox Church and arrests of tens of thousands of Ukrainian teachers and intellectuals — 45 of whom were the subject of a show trial at the Kharkiv Opera House. Thousands of Ukrainian books were removed from schools and libraries. The dictionary project was now judged subversive, and many of those who worked on it were arrested and shot. Ukrainian-language newspapers and magazines were given lists of words not to be used, and replacements closer to Russian. One letter was even removed from Ukrainian Cyrillic, to make it more like the Russian, as if the very alphabet were guilty of treason and had to be punished.

Then came the senseless scheme of compelling some of the Soviet Union’s most productive farmers to abandon their land and move to the untried new collectives. Not only was this imposing an ideological blueprint that didn’t work; it was carried out with a cruelty that guaranteed millions of people in the ethnically Ukrainian rural areas would starve. Peasant families were allowed to keep no food for themselves: Teams of Communist Party activists ripped up floorboards and poked through haylofts with iron rods, confiscating all they found, including grain being kept as seed for the next year’s crop. Despite the rotting, emaciated corpses of starved adults and children piling up along streets and highways and the wolves that took over abandoned farmhouses, the seizures continued, in part to find grain the state could sell abroad for hard currency. When even loyal party officials raised objections, they were fired, jailed or shot. If resistance to the requisitions and to collectivization was not stamped out, Stalin wrote to Lazar Kaganovich, one of his henchmen, in 1932, “we may lose Ukraine.”

The planned starvation, the execution of the territory’s best artists and intellectuals, the destruction of churches and the crushing of traditional village culture terrified into silence any Ukrainians who wanted autonomy or independence. Then finally, 60 years later, what Stalin had feared happened virtually overnight, and Russia did lose Ukraine. The history of all that happened between these two tragically intertwined peoples in the early 20th century fills in the background to Putin’s ruthless desire to gain influence or control over Ukraine once again.

Applebaum has painstakingly mined a vast array of sources, many of which were not available when the historian Robert Conquest wrote his pioneering history of the famine, “The Harvest of Sorrow,” 30 years ago: oral histories of survivors; national and local archives in Ukraine, including those of the secret police; and archives in Russia, which opened in the 1990s and then partly closed again, but not before various scholars published collections of documents from them.

One account of the famine comes from the young Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, who walked 40 miles through starvation-ridden districts in 1933 and, after he left the country, wrote one of the very few eyewitness descriptions of the carnage to appear in the Western press. Jones has been celebrated before, but Applebaum also tells the less known story of how, after he spoke out, Stalin’s government successfully strong-armed British and American correspondents in Moscow into denying what he said — even though some of them had been his sources, telling him what would have been censored from their own dispatches.

A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.","“They have to realize the world has changed,” Ms. Klobuchar said.

Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid television, radio and print political advertising has been subject for years. The Federal Election Commission justified the so-called internet exemption rule by declaring the internet “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.”

That attitude has many fewer adherents after the revelations that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, Facebook sold more than $100,000 worth of ads to a Russian company linked to the Kremlin, while Google sold at least $4,700 worth of ads to accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government.

Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.

“It’s ridiculous,” said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. “We need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew — and we all knew — that this was possible.”

The new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.

The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 “are a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,” Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.

The regulatory pressure comes at a particularly trying time for Google, Facebook and other tech giants. The companies, once celebrated as benevolent drivers of innovation and economic growth, are facing mounting criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for complex tax avoidance efforts, the hosting of pages used in sex trafficking, lax privacy protections and increasing monopoly power.

In response, they have ramped up lobbying and public relations campaigns, with Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, last week whirring through Washington on an apology tour and charm offensive.

Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.

After initially resisting requests to turn over Russian-linked ads, Facebook has provided them to a congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But Google has yet to do so, and neither company has made the ads public.

And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.

When the Federal Election Commission moved to strengthen its online disclaimer requirements in 2011 and again last year, the companies either ignored requests for input or suggested that new rules could “stand in the way of innovation,” as Facebook asserted in a 2011 comment to the commission.

Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity — that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie’s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.

While the election commission approved Google’s request, which was submitted in 2010, by a 4-to-2 vote, it deadlocked 3 to 3 on Facebook’s request, which was submitted the next year. Facebook nonetheless proceeded as if it was exempt from the disclaimer requirement, declining to mandate that political advertisements on its platform list their sponsors.

Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It was “kind of like the chickens coming home to roost,” said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.

She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that “the savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.” because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.

Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.

“Russia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,” he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because — according to Facebook — they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”

Citing United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, “The Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Critics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, “but they were silent,” said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.

“And they are still trying to avoid regulation,” Mr. Noble said.

A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.

And the company’s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, “We look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution” to “achieve transparency in political advertising.”

She pointed out that the company had enacted new policies to self-police its ads, which Facebook asserted in a company blog post “would have caught these malicious actors faster and prevented more improper ads from running” in 2016.

Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said that strict ads policies, including limits on political-ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion, already exist at Google. But the company is “taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.”",Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/facebook-google-russia-meddling-disclosure.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

In hiring Waititi for “Thor,” Marvel found a director with an anarchic visual aesthetic whose storytelling interests were nonetheless deeply, satisfyingly conventional.
PhotoThanks to Waititi’s dogged geniality, the 84 days of principal photography for “Thor: Ragnarok” were, according to basically everyone, pretty fun.
On his earlier films, Waititi often felt he had to do everything.
Up to now, Thor has been the most boring of the Marvel movie superheroes.","But in one very obvious way, Waititi doesn’t fit the mold. All those other directors are white; Waititi is Maori, from the Te Whanau-a-Apanui tribe, and so the bet Marvel was making by hiring Waititi was not only on an indie director but also on the first indigenous person ever to be handed the reins of a superhero megamovie. One reason they felt comfortable giving him those reins was that “Boy” and “Wilderpeople,” despite their minuscule American box office, were offbeat crowd-pleasers — indeed, in New Zealand they were blockbusters, the most popular Kiwi films ever made, in part because of the complex way Waititi treated his Maori heritage on-screen.

Marvel asked Waititi to meet in summer 2015. “I didn’t really think this was my cup of tea,” he said. “It’s always nice to be wanted, though.” Given the brief to pitch directing a “Thor” buddy comedy that he would help write, Waititi suggested “ ‘Withnail & I’ in space,” “just these two people who happen to be superheroes making their way across the universe.” (In this formula, the Hulk is the volatile Withnail figure, and Thor must “take care of this time bomb and keep him out of trouble” as they travel from planet to planet.) In their final meeting, Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, asked Waititi why he thought he could handle such a gargantuan project. “Because I’ve been doing it in my head my whole life,” Waititi replied. Feige loved that answer, because he feels that’s how he got his job, too.

Directing a movie like “Thor” requires a daunting set of skills, many of which have little to do with framing a shot: the temperament to manage a set with as many as 1,000 people on it rather than 100; the know-how to oversee complex effects; the canniness to please your bosses; the confidence not to be intimidated by the money, the stars, the vastness of the task. You’re more the captain of a complex, hierarchical aircraft carrier than the solo skipper of a dinghy. At one point, Waititi cheerfully calculated that he was spending the cumulative budget of his previous four films every few weeks on the set of “Thor.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the “Thor” universe, “Ragnarok” refers to the apocalyptic cycle of death and rebirth, freely adapted from Norse mythology, and Waititi cheekily nodded to the concept as he finished his coffee and prepared to head to set. “I can either play it safe and do the framing and everything like the way I feel these movies should be made,” he said. “Or — knowing that I can always go back to my small films that I do with my friends — I could approach this in this Ragnarok way, full out, heading for the fire, sprinting full speed toward Armageddon.”

That approach sounded a little scary. Waititi giggled. “It’s terrifying if, like, if you let them see the terror,” he said. “But I hide it really well.”

Waititi grew up splitting time between Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, and the East Cape of the North Island, the setting of “Boy.” His father was a Maori painter, his mother a pakeha (white) schoolteacher. After an uninspired run at studying drama in college (one professor said that his only real memory of Waititi was that he didn’t expect him to succeed), he spent a decade performing sketch comedy, often with his Victoria University mates Clement and McKenzie.

In 2005, his short film “Two Cars, One Night” was nominated for an Academy Award. An 11-minute vignette about Maori kids stuck waiting for their parents in the parking lot outside an East Cape bar, the short is less antic than Waititi’s features would be but is a low-key prototype for the kinds of stories he wanted to tell, which he has described as “either comedies with depressing bits or dramas with funny bits.” At the Oscars, as Jeremy Irons introduced the nominees for best live-action short film, Waititi pretended to be asleep in his seat as the camera tracked to him. (He thought his fellow nominees had agreed to the gag, cooked up over drinks one night, but the rest weren’t serious.) “I had no intention of being a filmmaker,” Waititi said, but the short “got a lot of attention, and I didn’t have anything else on.”

He also had a national film commission that was eager to finance his directorial work. Waititi’s first feature, “Eagle vs. Shark,” was an aggressively quirky romance between two misfits, played by Clement and Loren Horsley. He followed it with an expansion of “Two Cars, One Night”: “Boy,” about a Michael Jackson-mad Maori kid called Boy growing up in the East Cape in the 1980s and his ne’er-do-well father, played by Waititi himself. With its wicked humor and unsentimental treatment of Maori life, it was an immediate sensation in New Zealand, becoming the highest-grossing locally produced film of all time. “Boy” featured Waititi-drawn animation and a “Thriller”-meets-Maori-war-dance number, but just as often, Waititi’s directorial flourishes served to deepen and sadden the film. One recurring flashback is a bloody tableau of Boy’s mother lying dead while his weeping aunties cradle his infant brother.

“Essentially it’s a comedy about child neglect,” Waititi said. “I wanted to do something that showed that even living in the poorest area of New Zealand is funny.” Waititi noted that pakehas were the ones most likely to complain about his depiction of Maori life. “They’re usually disappointed that there aren’t, like, more ghosts in the story.” He laughed. “ ‘Shouldn’t he be talking to his dead mother right now?’ No, because that never happens to anyone. Never happened to me. I’ve never been in contact with any of these ghosts or ridden any of these whales.”

After a mockumentary about vampire roommates, “What We Do in the Shadows” — directed with Clement — Waititi made “Hunt for the Wilderpeople.” A spirited comedy about a foster kid lost in the bush with his grumpy guardian, “Wilderpeople” grapples with grief and puts its heroes in real emotional and physical danger, transforming into a classic family-adventure story that just happens to center on a juvenile delinquent who names his dog Tupac. As with “Boy,” audiences embraced a story with predominantly Maori characters as archetypically Kiwi. “He welcomed everyone into Maori culture,” says the Maori actor Rachel House, who played a maniacal child-protection officer in “Wilderpeople” and is also in “Ragnarok.” The film surpassed the domestic box-office record set by “Boy” in a month and a half.

In hiring Waititi for “Thor,” Marvel found a director with an anarchic visual aesthetic whose storytelling interests were nonetheless deeply, satisfyingly conventional. “In a lot of my films,” Waititi said, “the biggest theme is family, making families out of those around you.” That theme drives Marvel Studios’ “Guardians of the Galaxy” series, an unexpected hit whose energy the third “Thor” movie seems designed to replicate.

Thanks to Waititi’s dogged geniality, the 84 days of principal photography for “Thor: Ragnarok” were, according to basically everyone, pretty fun. He opened the shoot with a ceremony featuring ritual dances and greetings from the local Aboriginal tribe, the Bundjalung people, as well as a Maori celebrant. “A set should be like a family, except that you all actually like each other,” Waititi said. “We just play music all day, we dance, we talk.” At times it seemed Waititi — dancing, blasting disco — was putting on a one-man show with unflagging enthusiasm. Waititi’s favorite gag, according to his star, Chris Hemsworth, was to “forget” his set mike was on and then to perform complaints about his leading actor, midtake, for everyone to hear: “Ah, we should’ve got the other Chris. Chris Pine, Chris Pratt, anything but Hemsworth.” Then there’d be a muffled scrabbling, and Waititi would say, “Oh, crap — sorry, guys, sorry.”

Cornel Ozies, an Australian Aboriginal filmmaker who was one of eight native people Waititi invited to shadow him on the “Ragnarok” shoot, characterizes Waititi’s on-set style as specifically indigenous: “If you talk about his Maori heritage, it’s big families. When you have big families, you’re going to have a lot of clashes,” adding, “you pick up the skill set of being a mediator.” For Waititi, the choice to maintain this disposition, which he calls “Happy Taika,” underlies his entire directorial philosophy. “I’ve been on a lot of film sets,” he said, “and I’ve always promised myself I wouldn’t create a set where people dread coming to work.” He made a face like a kid tasting something sour. “Shooting a movie should be fun! It’s not a real job. It can be hard, but at the end of the day we’re dressing up and playing pretend.”

Waititi found that a production this size lessened the responsibility he had to take on, making the job of a director a simpler one. On his earlier films, Waititi often felt he had to do everything. “When it’s low-budget,” he said, “every job you take is one you don’t have to pay someone else to do.” Here there were hundreds of crew members around, which encouraged Waititi to delegate. On those other films too, he knew that any decision he made about lighting, sets, even performances was “basically baked in forever.” On “Thor,” where digital artists waited to paint over every frame, that pressure was lessened. “In some ways,” Waititi observed, “this makes you feel a little lazier. You’re like” — he waved his hand dismissively — “ ‘Ah, I’m sure it’ll be fine later.’ ”

On a set where every action shot was previsualized and every stunt was choreographed, it wasn’t always easy to direct instinctively, as Waititi was used to doing. “Sometimes,” he acknowledged, “it’s just too late to say, ‘Oh, man, wouldn’t it be cool if like a thousand robots came in and Thor fell off a cliff?’ ” But he still found ways to play. One day, while doing the motion-capture for Korg, Waititi rushed into a battle sequence wielding a big prop hammer, then flipped the hammer around and started pretending to shoot it like a gun. “O.K., CGI,” he declared, “I want you to turn that hammer into a gun hammer.” In the finished movie, that dumb idea is a delightful reality.

Pretending at this scale is a lot easier for an indie director, of course, when he’s working inside a system expressly designed to have megamovie training wheels. Waititi was surrounded, the Marvel executive producer Brad Winderbaum noted, with experienced, talented technicians. Once the shoot was over, he had a year of postproduction to hone the story and several weeks of scheduled reshoots to fix anything that went wrong the first time around. “He’s never going to feel out at sea, wondering how he’s going to achieve this,” Winderbaum said, and then with a shrug offered a fittingly superhuman claim of omnipotence: “We know how to achieve everything.”

If Waititi, with his sense of frenetic rhythm, were to depict the long process of navigating security on Disney’s Hollywood lot and finding him in the “Thor: Ragnarok” postproduction suite, it would all zip past in a four-second montage of opening doors. The broad stone gate on Alameda Avenue, mouse ears embedded at the top of its arch, as the barricade swings into the air. The gentle fwoomp of the entrance to the Frank G. Wells building releasing the building’s air-conditioned atmosphere. A publicist’s waving her key card at the security console at a glass door in Marvel Studios headquarters, surveilled by a life-size Iron Man. The laminated sign Scotch-taped to an otherwise-anonymous wooden door as it opens: CREATURE REPORT.

“That’s our code name,” Waititi said in his office with a happy grin. He’s tall and slim, his hair that December day buzzed and gray at the temples, piled pell-mell in a dark Lyle Lovett pouf at the top of his head. It was now 330 days until release. “Hopefully by June, July, the film will actually look somewhat like it should look,” Waititi said. “At the moment it’s basically a blue screen with people in front of it. Its just blue, blue, blue, blue everywhere.” He gestured at an editing bay in the corner, its monitor featuring Goldblum posing before a blue tarp.

“I’m not a massive fan of the postproduction phase,” he said. “I really like being on set and making stuff up.” Nevertheless, here he was, for almost a full year. “I used to really laugh at everyone who was stuck in traffic, driving to the studios in Burbank,” he said. “And now I’m one of those people.”

Waititi walked across the hall into a dark, soundproof editing suite, where the editor Joel Negron, a veteran of Michael Bay blow-’em-ups, waited at the Avid terminal. Frozen on a wide-screen TV was the face of Hemsworth’s Thor, his once-flowing blond hair cut spikily short. “Is that a spoiler?” Waititi asked the publicist, pointing to the screen.

“Not by the time the story comes out,” she replied.

“Ah, you can write that down, then,” Waititi said cheerily. “We Ragnaroked Thor’s hair.”

The haircut is a potent symbol of the brand-new Thor that Hemsworth craved. Up to now, Thor has been the most boring of the Marvel movie superheroes. “I just ended up being the straight guy,” Hemsworth told me. “Sort of the guy from another world who the joke was on him half the time. I wanted a little more wit and charm.” In the first two films, Waititi said, Thor is “basically a rich kid from outer space who comes down to Earth and gets to kiss a cute girl.” He laughed. “This is the most human that Thor’s ever been. Luckily this film’s coming out on Earth, and the audience will be predominantly human, so I think they’ll relate to him much more than they have in previous films.”

Asked by the publicist to explain the context of the scene, Waititi thought for a moment. “Hulk has been Hulk since the end of ‘Avengers 2,’ ” he said. “Eventually, we’re going to have to see Bruce Banner” — his human counterpart, played by Mark Ruffalo — “in this movie.” The scene was loose and funny. “I was Hulk for two years?” Banner asked in dismay. The two heroes were inside a spaceship, an enormous set that was built for “The Avengers” and shipped to Australia at, presumably, astronomical cost. When the scene ended, Negron said, “Three minutes flat.”

“Cool,” Waititi said. “Cut it in half, then it’ll be amazing.” Over the next two hours, Waititi and Negron chipped away, deleting lines they didn’t find funny enough. They watched all 16 takes of Banner’s response, in which Ruffalo’s improvisations ranged from a deadpan “Oh, no” to screaming shock. Waititi by now was sunk deep into the couch. He came upon a tweet from Peyton Reed, director of “Ant-Man.” Looking at his picture, Waititi said, “All these Marvel directors look the same!” He laughed. “Scott Derrickson and James Gunn and Peyton all look like the same person.” He asked to watch the very beginning of the sequence again: “Do we have the other angle, from behind Banner?” Negron opened a folder full of neatly labeled shots, in each of which Ruffalo, enthusiastically pretending to transform from a monster into a human, fell out of frame. Waititi mentioned that he was hoping the camera might pan down with Banner as he shrank; he hadn’t shot it that way back in Australia, but in about two minutes Negron built a rough move inside the editing software, making it so.

“That’s fine for now,” Waititi said. “The VFX team will perfect it later.” One thing Waititi was delighted to discover while shooting a blockbuster is that it isn’t that hard to create a shot he didn’t actually get. “We scan every surface and every part of every set,” he explained, including the entire interior of the bespoke spaceship. “So this all exists inside the computer, and we can move the camera and create moves.”

Around the world, 18 effects houses had started creating the hundreds of shots that would fill in all those blue screens. “I don’t think there’ll be any bits of my particular style, which is, like, purposefully crap,” Waititi said. “I don’t think that’s what Marvel wants. They want purposefully amazing.” He stood and stretched, restless. “How long is it now?” he asked.

“About two,” Negron said.

“Pretty good, guys!” Waititi said. “Cut a minute out of the movie!”

“Couple more to go and we’re there,” Negron said.

Waititi opened the editing-room door with a satisfied flourish. “You’ve got to kill your babies, as they say.”

“Darlings?” Negron asked.

“I wouldn’t say I love them that much,” Waititi replied. “They’re just babies.”

In the summer — right before Waititi, dressed in a crisp pineapple-print shirt-and-shorts combo, delivered a bravura performance at San Diego Comic-Con — the directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were let go from the “Star Wars” Han Solo film. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that the directors’ improvisational style didn’t play well with the screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan or Lucasfilm executives, who in a news release cited “different creative visions” for the split. A fan suggested on Twitter that Waititi should direct a “Star Wars” movie. “Lolz, I like to complete my films,” Waititi replied. “I’d be fired within a week.”

“That particular franchise seems really hard,” he elaborated in September. “There’s not much room for someone like me.” Through its narrow canon, the tone of “Star Wars” has always been determinedly self-serious, whereas the Marvel movies, like the decades of comics they sprang from, veer wildly from high drama to low comedy. And improvisation has been a tool in every Marvel movie since Robert Downey Jr. riffed his way through “Iron Man.” “Taika’s a really funny actor,” says Tessa Thompson, who plays Valkyrie in “Ragnarok.” “So we had a lot of guidance for the improv. It wasn’t a bunch of, like, ships without rudders slamming into each other.” Indeed, Waititi figures, if it wasn’t for his comedy chops, why would Marvel have hired him in the first place? “They want new voices and different ways of telling stories,” he says. “All the work to do with actors, all the rescripting stuff in the moment — that’s what I want to do, really. I’m always going to leave the CG stuff up to someone else.”

It was 50 days before release. Waititi, hair trimmed short and streaked with gray throughout, absolutely looked a year older. The movie would be delivered in its complete form around the beginning of October. “One day I’ll show up and my key card will stop working, I imagine,” he said wistfully. “That’s good. I’ve pretty much come very close to finishing what I can offer, you know?”

He admitted that the final product doesn’t betray much of his D.I.Y. aesthetic. But his stamp is on the film in other ways: in the way he has framed a superhero movie as a misfit family adventure with gun hammers. In the way he Ragnaroked Valkyrie — white and blond in the comics, but played here by Thompson, an actor of black and Latino descent. In the way the native filmmakers who shadowed Waititi learned that it’s possible for an indigenous artist to dance his way through a $180 million movie.

And in the way he ricocheted around the big Marvel ship, putting on a two-year show, using all the tools they bought for him to make something he likes — “a Taika version of one of these movies,” he said with satisfaction. It’s worth noting that Marvel’s next directors and superheroes also look less like Marvel directors, less like the stereotype of Marvel heroes: Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther” arrives in February, and Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden (the writer-director duo behind the 2006 Ryan-Gosling-on-cocaine drama “Half Nelson”) are in preproduction for a movie featuring the superheroine Captain Marvel for 2019. Waititi dressed up and played pretend, and with the help of Marvel’s omnipotence, he can now direct any movie he likes, big or small. As the Marvel ship plows on, churning up piles of money, its superheroes might soon come to resemble the predominantly human audience that watches them on Earth.",The Superweirdo Behind ‘Thor: Ragnarok’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/magazine/the-superweirdo-behind-thor-ragnarok.html

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said.
Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls.
“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said.
“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said.","Having spent 15 years photographing child marriages around the world, Stephanie Sinclair is uniquely positioned to understand its lasting impact on communities and, especially, on the girls who were forced to wed against their will. “You can’t expect individuals who have been through significant abuse to just act normal as soon as they get out of that situation,” she said. “They need to be nurtured, to be given the time and the tools to heal.”

With this in mind, Ms. Sinclair last year started the Tehani Photo Workshop — named after an 8-year-old Yemeni bride — in partnership with the Samburu Girls Foundation. The Kenyan organization, led by Josephine Kulea, focuses on educating girls rescued from child marriage, female genital mutilation and beading, a tradition where girls adorned with red beads have to serve the needs of an older male relative.

“Research shows that when girls are empowered and have strong connections outside of the family, they have a better chance of protecting themselves and their future,” Ms. Sinclair said. Looking at her own career, she felt that photography could be a vehicle to help these girls. “The independence that comes with a such a career, the knowledge you acquire through meeting other people, and the freedom the camera gives you to express yourself can’t be underplayed,” she said. “Instinctively, I knew that a photo workshop could nurture the girls in a unique way.”

Twice now, a dozen or so 11- to 16-year-olds gathered at the Ngari Hill Eco-Lodge for five days to talk about images and the place of women in society. Ms. Sinclair shares her long-term project, which helps the participants understand that it’s a global issue affecting one girl every two seconds; that it’s the result of women not being valued as they should; and that what they’d been through is not their fault. She also introduces basic photographic concepts using examples of work done by or on strong African women. The goal is to inspire them while also teaching them photo skills before they pair off with another participant and are joined by a student-mentor from the previous workshop to make pictures in the surrounding hills.

“A lot of the photographs they’ve taken speak to the different moments in their lives,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Many, this year, even re-enacted what happened to them. We didn’t tell them to do this.” In one, Jackline holds out her beaded necklace while dressed in her school uniform, an effort to demonstrate how beading interrupts education. In another, Nachaki leans against a branch off the ground. “I was worried they’d fall when I first saw them climbing, but then they told me how, when they fled their marriage and hid in the forest, they’d sleep in trees to protect themselves from the animals in the wild,” Ms. Sinclair recalled.

Others hint at the bonds developing among the girls, like in the picture of Linnet and Eunice laughing in their room, or Susan and Silvana walking arm in arm, as well as in the portraits they’ve made of each other. Only when sitter and photographer are in sync do you get images that capture both vulnerability and strength.

The workshop culminates in a community exhibition and presentation where they speak about what matters most to them. Both times, Ms. Sinclair said, they felt compelled to share what they’d been through, how it affected them, why girls’ lives matter, and why they should have the same opportunities as boys. In short, how “girls can do anything,” a line they often repeated in their remarks. The message resonated powerfully with those in attendance. Not only did it come from those who lived through the ordeal, but also from community members, female relatives, and young women who speak the same language and share the same cultural background.

“They say that every girl who is empowered impacts at least 250 people in her community,” Ms. Sinclair said. “Though we’ve only had 22 students so far, slowly those number add up.”

She hopes to hold more workshops, in Kenya and elsewhere, as long as her not-for-profit “Too Young to Wed” continues receiving the financing and logistical support to do its work without taking any shortcuts.

“You want these workshops to be intimate, because therapy isn’t a mass process,” she said. “It’s not just the act of photography that helps; it’s bringing together girls who have all experienced a similar type of trauma for what really is a retreat, a time to be nurtured, to grow, and to build community.”

WASHINGTON — Let’s just get this out of the way: There are other matters of consequence going on in the world.

But in these fractious times, a series of puppy photos sent by none other than the fun-loving scamps at the Central Intelligence Agency qualifies as a feel-good, stick-it-to-the-man moment, shared by thousands of people who are marooned in office jobs. Meet Lulu, the black Labrador retriever and free spirit who bucked expectations and flunked out of the C.I.A.’s explosive detection “puppy class.”

Maybe it was her shiny coat that made Lulu’s story ricochet around the internet. Maybe it was her soft brown eyes. Or maybe her story just sounds familiar to any American who has experienced workplace ennui: She underwent rigorous training for a daily grind job and decided that sniffing out bombs was not her calling. (And who actually wants that job, anyway?)

The photos were a rare attempt at a cutesy moment from a secretive agency better known for much darker stories. The number of C.I.A. personnel killed in Afghanistan now rivals the number of agency operatives who died in the wars in Vietnam and Laos decades ago. The agency has pushed for extended powers to carry out covert drone strikes in active war zones. So even the course load for its bomb dogs is high-stakes and rigorous.

Ms. Mack said the months after were a blur of heartbreak, anger, financial uncertainty and shame.
“Somebody gets set up on a date with me, they can find out everything about me,” Ms. Mack said.","She also has something perhaps more valuable: intimate knowledge of loss, grief and starting over, and a determination to be something other than just a footnote in the Madoff saga.

“I don’t want to get defined by Bernie Madoff and his crimes. I don’t want to be defined by the fact that my husband killed himself,” Ms. Mack, 43, said recently, sitting at the kitchen counter of her apartment in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, where she and her two children, 8 and 10, have lived since 2016. “There are thousands of other stylists and personal shoppers who do the same thing I do, but I wanted to get back out there again.”

She’s not in the market mainly for ball gowns, either. For $200 an hour, with a three-hour minimum, Ms. Mack helps clients choose simple pieces like the best jeans (her own, on this day, were by Mother, worn with a white Hanes T-shirt and black Converse sneakers) and the kicky accessories to go with them. She loves a good beanie. She sits in closets, making notes on Post-its, listening and nodding. Sometimes clients will talk about their recent breakup, or divorce.

“That’s when I’m like, ‘Listen. Don’t think that you’re staring at some girl who has it all because let me tell you what happened to me,’” Ms. Mack said. “When you’re in that position, of something bad that’s happened to you, you feel very alone. I felt very alone in my crisis. In my family disaster. You feel like you’re the only person it’s happening to.”

Where Bernard Madoff focused his career on obscuring as much as possible, Ms. Mack’s approach is the opposite.

“I wasn’t going to hide,” she said. “I have nothing to hide.”

The Young Widow

Until December 2008, Ms. Mack’s story read like a spec script for “Sex and the City.”

The oldest of two children, she was raised on the Upper East Side, mostly by her mother, a special-education tutor, and her stepfather, a litigator (both now retired). Her father, a management consultant, died when she was 18. Ms. Mack attended the private school Nightingale-Bamford.

After double-majoring in art and art history at Franklin & Marshall College, she moved back to the old neighborhood. She lived in a tiny studio apartment, working as an assistant photo editor for George, John F. Kennedy Jr.’s magazine, then as a fashion assistant to Narciso Rodriguez, who designed Carolyn Bessette Kennedy’s wedding gown.

A blind date with an older, divorced man named Mark Madoff led to a second date, then a third. In 2004, in a Narciso dress of her own, she married him on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. They lived in an apartment in SoHo, a house in Greenwich, Conn., and in another on Nantucket. They added one child to Mark’s two from his previous marriage, and Stephanie was pregnant with another.

“We had a really, really nice life,” Ms. Mack said. “We had means to have beautiful homes, and do what we want when we wanted.”

In December 2008, the fairy tale took a dark and lurching twist when Bernie Madoff confessed to his sons, Mark and Andrew, that he had spent the better part of his career in finance carrying out a massive Ponzi scheme. His sons, who had worked for their father’s firm for their entire careers, turned him in to authorities, who soon arrested Mr. Madoff.

The fraud devastated families, hedge funds and nonprofits from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Europe and beyond.

Ms. Mack’s mother and stepfather had investments with Mr. Madoff, as did many of her and Mark’s close friends.

In March 2009, Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts, including theft, fraud and money laundering. Mark, Andrew and Ruth, their mother, said they knew nothing of the scheme. Ms. Mack believed them. Others weren’t so sure, including the bankruptcy trustee. But they were never charged, and in June 2009 Mr. Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

Overnight, Ms. Mack had entered a circus of lawyers, F.B.I. agents, paparazzi and tabloid headlines.

After considering changing her last name to Morgan she decided on Mack, after ACK, the airport code for Nantucket. “I just didn’t want to hear it anymore,” she said, adding that Mark planned to change his name once his lawyers gave the O.K.

But with constant news coverage of the scandal and multiple civil suits, Mark seemed to be spiraling emotionally. In October 2009, he attempted suicide, swallowing pills and landing in a psychiatric ward. Over the next year, he worked on a new business, a real-estate newsletter.

Things seemed to be looking up, Ms. Mack said, but then Mark attempted suicide once again, this time successfully, with his 2-year-old son sleeping in an adjacent bedroom. Ms. Mack was in Walt Disney World with her 4-year old daughter, and awoke to two emails from Mark, one asking her to send someone to care for their son, the other blank, with the subject line: “I love you.”

Photo

Her stepfather rushed to the couple’s SoHo apartment, where he found Mark’s body.

Ms. Mack said the months after were a blur of heartbreak, anger, financial uncertainty and shame. “I am somebody who cannot stand waiters singing ‘Happy Birthday’ to me in a restaurant. Can you imagine your life being plastered everywhere?” she said. “And then, your husband taking his own life two years later is shameful. It’s just shameful.”

Mark’s suicide, many surmised, was an indication of his guilt.

“I was like, ‘No way. He’s not going down like this. I’m telling the truth,’” Ms. Mack said. In 2011 she published “The End of Normal,” a memoir in which she wrote at length about her steadfast belief that Mark was clueless about his father’s fraud.

She finished a graduate school program at Bank Street College of Education, hoping to work with pediatric patients and their families in hospitals, but found it too much to manage with her two young children.

“That word is a very difficult word to say. To be a widow? You just think of that old lady,” Ms. Mack said. “It just sounds old and depressing and sad to me. Look, I’m not old-old. I’m not 25, but I’m not old. And I’m not depressing.”

She got the idea to become a stylist over dinner with a friend, after starting to date again, tentatively, in 2012 and realizing that a good outfit was a kind of protection. “Somebody gets set up on a date with me, they can find out everything about me,” Ms. Mack said. “Literally everything. To become less nervous, I needed to feel like I looked good.”

She contacted several high-end matchmakers and soon found herself working with people who were also seeking romantic relationships in less than ideal circumstances.

“I learned very quickly that everyone has a story, and a bad story,” Ms. Mack said. “The only difference between me and whomever is that mine was public. It’s loss. It’s the same emotion.”

‘A Working Mom’

Her client base soon expanded beyond the dating world. A cookbook author who needed help putting together an ensemble for a book party. A woman on a very tight budget celebrating her appearance in an Oscar-nominated documentary.

Tara Roscioli, a nutritionist, author and entrepreneur, made an appointment to meet Ms. Mack not long ago at Otte, a store on North Moore Street in TriBeCa. The two women arrived early and went through the racks together before heading toward the rear of the store.

“I knew she was a single mom. And I knew that she was an author. I didn’t know anything else,” Ms. Roscioli said. “She’s very real and down-to-earth, and her style and clothes are the same way. She’s a working mom. She gives off a very ‘real woman’ vibe that resonated with me.”

When Ms. Roscioli emerged from the fitting room in a long black dress (Ulla Johnson, $750), Ms. Mack suggested adding a leather jacket (Iro, $1,200).

“Do you feel comfortable in it? Does it feel special enough? Do you feel amazing?,” she asked, making notes. “The biggest mistake is putting on something you don’t feel comfortable in.”

The expedition ended with no sale but a hug and promise of another meeting.

Veronica Miele Beard, a designer and the co-founder of the fashion line Veronica Beard, has known Ms. Mack since they attended Franklin & Marshall.

“Shoppers now want an emotional attachment to clothing,” Ms. Beard said. “They want to feel an emotional reason for buying a piece. Stephanie brings that out. She cares about how clothing makes her clients feel.”

What about how Ms. Mack feels?

Mark’s brother, Andrew, died in 2014 of lymphoma. Bernie’s brother, Peter, is serving a federal prison sentence. Bernie is scheduled for release in 2139. And Ruth has settled into a quiet life in Old Greenwich, Conn.

The surviving unincarcerated members of the Madoff family spent years split into factions, often not speaking with one another. But that has changed, Ms. Mack said, adding that she is now in regular contact with Ruth and that relations have improved with Mark’s ex-wife. (Both women confirmed this.)

“She is so much fun to be around, and I wish the public could see that side of her,” Ms. Mack said of Ruth. “I’ve urged her to have a comeback. Everyone loves a comeback.”

As for Bernie?

“He’s dead to me.”

This summer, Ms. Mack’s lawyers hammered out a settlement with the bankruptcy trustee, Irving Picard, who was sorting out the financial mess left in the wake of the Ponzi scheme, and she handed over what she says was the majority of her fortune.

By 2016, the apartment in SoHo was sold, as was the house on Nantucket and the house in Greenwich. After Mark’s suicide, Ms. Mack had moved from SoHo to TriBeCa, but she could no longer afford it, she said, and so she crossed the bridge into Brooklyn.

Yet, she knows what the public likely still thinks about her — that, as a Madoff, she was “dripping in diamonds.” That she still is.

“That was never me,” Ms. Mack said. “Even when I was a wealthy Madoff. I didn’t marry Mark Madoff, get a credit card and drop $30,000 in any store I wanted.”

“I didn’t just frivolously go out and spend just tons and tons of money,” she said.

Marybeth Gibson, a friend and real-estate agent on Nantucket, said in a phone interview: “Stephanie would rather stay home and cook a roast chicken than she would get all dressed up and go out.”

Ms. Mack wonders, sometimes, what Mark must have been thinking when he made the decision to commit suicide, to abandon her. She thinks Mark didn’t see a life where he wouldn’t be swarmed by photographers. He simply couldn’t imagine a bright future. He thought he “was toast.”

Initially, Ms. Mack changed her last name out of the same fear — that the Madoff name might forever brand her a pariah. She now knows what she is convinced Mark could not bring himself to see, that infamy can be as fleeting as fame.

The scandal that once rocked New York has moved off the front pages of the tabloids. The paparazzi have moved on, circling the apartment buildings of other people. And Ms. Mack has resumed using her married name in her personal life and on her FreshDirect boxes.

As her clients try on jeans and dresses and beanies, and they share the trauma of their own loss, Ms. Mack tries to convince them of the same thing she wanted Mark to believe: It won’t always be quite this hard, this raw.

“I’m like, ‘You know what? It’s not going to get better by Friday. It’s not going to get better in two weeks. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take a lot of time,’” she said. “I’m actual living proof.”

“I don’t have what I used to have, but I have more than a lot of the rest of the planet,” she said. “And I’m grateful for that.”","A Madoff Gets a Makeover, by Giving Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/style/stephanie-mack-stylist-bernie-madoff-mark.html

In 1974, Pakistan’s elected Parliament declared Ahmadis to be non-Muslims. Religious parties had held street protests demanding this, and even though Parliament back then was full of liberals and socialists, there was hardly a dissenting voice when the time came to pass the law.

Our Parliament today is still at it. Last week Muhammad Safdar, a son-in-law of the recently deposed prime minister, thundered against Ahmadis, demanding they be banned from joining the armed forces. He also demanded that a physics department of a university in Islamabad be renamed because in 2016 it was named after Abdus Salam, the only Pakistani scientist to become a Nobel laureate. The Pakistani government had already taken close to four decades to name anything after Mr. Salam, a theoretical physicist, because he was Ahmadi. It appears that not a single parliamentarian spoke up against Mr. Safdar’s diatribe.

Earlier this month, Parliament also changed the oath that Pakistanis are required to take to get a passport or run in an election. A standard version of the statement goes: “I hereby solemnly declare that I consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani to be an impostor nabi and also consider his followers, whether belonging to the Lahori or Qadiani group, to be non-Muslims.” (Nabi means prophet.) Language in the election law was changed from “I solemnly declare” to “I believe.”

It’s not clear why this happened. The government claims it was a clerical error. But there was a public uproar over the change, including accusations that the government was going soft on Ahmadis. Parliament promptly backtracked, and we all resumed solemnly declaring rather than just believing.

The word “Ahmadi” was hardly even used during the debate in Parliament. We prefer to call the Ahmadis “Qadianis,” meaning from Qadian. Ahmadis consider the word derogatory, which is why we use it.

I got a call a few months ago from my family who still lives in my ancestral village in Punjab. A stranger had come asking about me, I was told. He claimed to be my friend from school. While I was still trying to put a forgotten face to the name, my relative asked, “Is your friend a Qadiani?” I suddenly remembered the boy from my school who was indeed a friend and happened to be Ahmadi. I asked the relative, “How did you know he was a Qadiani?” The reply shouldn’t have shocked me, but it did. “I have an inbuilt Qadiani detector. I can always smell them.”

I wanted to remind my relative that when I was a kid and he was a young man, all his best friends were Ahmadis and I had seen him locked in our bathroom smoking his first cigarette with those infidels. But then I remembered the slap.

It must have been around 1974. I was about nine years old and was taking my Quran lessons. My teacher was gentle. At the time, protesters in the bazaars were asking shoppers not to go to Ahmadi-owned shops. I asked my teacher who the Ahmadis were, and he patiently explained that they were heretics, because they challenged the notion that Muhammad was Islam’s last prophet. I said, even if they are heretics, does Islam say we can’t buy stuff from their shops? The slap was full and hard.

As I grew up, Ahmadis went from being treated as zealous reformist Muslims to non-Muslims to kafir, or heretics — worse even than Hindus or Jews. In the mid-1980s, a decade after Ahmadis were declared non-Muslims, another set of laws forbade them to act like Muslims.

This is the tricky bit, because Ahmadis insist on calling themselves Muslim and behave like Muslims. They pray in mosques, they call out the azaan at prayer time, they say “assalam alaikum,” they invoke Allah’s will or his mercy — and every time they do any of the above, they violate the law of the land. If they call their mosque a mosque, they become criminals. If they call their daily prayers namaz, as Muslims do, they risk imprisonment. Ahmadis have been charged with blasphemy for printing a verse of the Quran on wedding invitations.

Early this month, I saw Pakistan’s foreign minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, give an interview on television. He had just returned from a tour of the United States and had been accused of hobnobbing with Ahmadis while there. He was at pains to explain that he had never met an Ahmadi in his life. To prove his point, he said that once, while he was sitting in a restaurant in Islamabad, two boys came up to get a selfie with him. “I asked them, ‘I hope you are not Qadianis.’” The foreign minister and the show host shared a hearty laugh.

I called up my long-lost Ahmadi friend recently and the brief conversation that followed was full of blasphemies. He was acting all Muslim. “Assalam alaikum,” he greeted me. By the grace of Allah, he said, he still has a job. Sometimes, when people suspect him of being Ahmadi, he is thrown out of shops or business meetings. But Allah is kind, my friend insisted. His wife, a teacher of fashion design, still has a job at a university — though she doesn’t use the staff room because some people have become suspicious. The kids are doing well, thanks to Allah, but he has told them not to tell even their closest friends that they are Ahmadis.

He tried to make us both feel better: Thanks to Allah, it’s not as bad for us as it is for Shias. Look how many of them get killed for their beliefs.

Pakistan was essentially created to protect the religious and economic rights of Muslims who were a minority before India’s partition in 1947. But since the country’s inception, we have created new minorities and keep finding new ways to torment them.","Pakistan, Land of the Intolerant",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/pakistan-muslims-ahmadis.html

But after a week on the market, “the offers were rolling in,” Mr. Monteiro said. “The apartment was really well priced, and it drove a bidding war. I asked Louis, ‘What is the highest number where you would feel comfortable and have no regrets in terms of not going any higher?’” Mr. Broccoli offered $500,000, but the apartment sold for $518,000.

Soon after, he was outbid for a one-bedroom in Hell’s Kitchen. He offered $560,000, but the apartment sold for the asking price, $580,000.

Low prices, he learned, often meant high monthly maintenance fees. And on the West Side, he was finding mostly small studios or fixer-uppers in his budget. So he decided to focus on areas around Midtown East, within walking distance of his office near Grand Central Terminal. That way, he said, “I could save on a MetroCard, and come home and walk my dog if I wanted to.”

One option was a studio with a dressing area, an estate sale in a Park Avenue building in the 30s. The asking price was $475,000, with maintenance of $925. The floor plan lent itself to the construction of a wall to create two rooms — or so it seemed.

Envisioning what a place would look like was “the fun part for me,” Mr. Broccoli said. In this case, based on a floor plan, he said, “I had a whole renovation in mind, but I underestimated how small it would be.” The apartment later sold for the asking price.

He briefly considered an alcove studio in a postwar building in Murray Hill, because he thought Hunter would like the terrace. But he decided the building lacked character.

“I checked StreetEasy every day, like a maniac,” Mr. Broccoli said. In the spring, he found a promising listing for a corner one-bedroom in Tudor City, a residential complex on far East 42nd Street, just 15 minutes from his office. It was in excellent condition, and the asking price was $525,000, with maintenance of around $1,100.

Mr. Broccoli was unable to attend the open house, as he had plans he couldn’t cancel, so Mr. Monteiro went in his place, taking video and reporting back. “I knew it was his apartment,” Mr. Monteiro said.

The video included the building’s lobby, where a dog of Hunter’s size happened to be passing through. Mr. Broccoli was encouraged. He made an offer of $560,000, sight unseen; it was one of several other offers, Mr. Monteiro said.

The owners, however, were wary about accepting an offer made by someone who hadn’t even seen the apartment. So Mr. Broccoli arrived early the next morning to visit in person. Then he increased his offer to $583,000. It was accepted.

“I had such bad luck,” Mr. Broccoli said. “I typically put all my eggs in one basket, and that’s why I get so devastated when it doesn’t happen.”

Here, he would have to do little but paint the walls. “I have pretty large furniture, and everything would fit,” he said. “It had amazing closet space and a dishwasher — these little things that are important for functional living.”

Mr. Broccoli arrived in the summer. He painted the apartment in shades of gray, hung some shelves and added art.

“There really is no consensus among the public about whether changing roles have made things better or easier for families or for men and women,” said Juliana Horowitz, associate director of research at Pew and an author of the report. Although there are small gender gaps, the partisan divide drives the differences in responses, she said. Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to say changing gender roles had improved people’s lives.

College graduates were also more likely than those without college degrees to say that changing gender roles were a good thing, and that more needed to be done. Of college graduates, 69 percent said men had it easier, compared with 27 percent of those with a high school education or less who said so. Seventy-one percent of college graduates said changing gender roles had given women more satisfying lives, compared with 49 percent of those without college degrees.

Views about gender equality reflected experiences with gender discrimination, particularly at work. Women, Democrats and college graduates were much more likely to say they were discriminated against because of their gender, and more likely to think gender equality had not gone far enough.

“Male privilege allows men to be free to move about in public without threat of harassment,” a woman, 54, told Pew, which published responses anonymously. “When they speak, they are assumed to have some authority without having to prove it. They still earn more money than women.”

But Republican men were more likely than Democratic men to say they had experienced discrimination. And while only 10 percent of the public said the country had gone too far toward gender equality, 23 percent of men who said they experienced discrimination said so.

The largest shares of both men and women who said they experienced gender discrimination said it came in hiring, pay or promotions. Ten percent of women said they had experienced harassment or catcalling.

When asked how women have it easier, one respondent, a 53-year-old man, said, “Lower standards for the same positions in order to get more women for those positions.” Another man, 46, said: “Everyone is on the prowl for perceived injustice and attempts to elevate women of all ages. Not so much for males.”

Explaining why men have it easier, a 29-year-old man said, “You simply need to look at the percentages of male C.E.O.s and relative salaries to see there is likely a systematic advantage to being male.”

Women have benefited more than men from being employed and from having men doing more at home, respondents said. But even for women, fewer than half of respondents said changing gender roles had benefited them outside work.

After their deaths, Mr. Ahmad assumed leadership of about 30 militants still fighting government forces in Marawi.

Analysts say Mr. Ahmad had helped organize and finance the travel of recruits from Indonesia before the Marawi siege in May to join in the fighting. The Philippine authorities have said that about 30 foreigners took part in the monthslong battle.

According to Philippine military intelligence, Mr. Ahmad also facilitated the travel of at least four Malaysians to join the Islamic State in the Middle East, including in Syria. He arrived on Mindanao, in the Philippines’ restive south, in 2014, where he sought out Mr. Hapilon and helped plan the Marawi siege and organize local terrorist cells.

A video released by the military showed him in a meeting with Mr. Hapilon and Mr. Maute as they meticulously planned the siege, which began on May 23. Mr. Ahmad reportedly funneled 30 million Philippine pesos, or about $580,000, to militants for the attack, according to intelligence officials.

Rommel Banlaoi, a terrorism expert who leads the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, said the funds went to help Mr. Hapilon’s group stockpile firearms, weapons and other logistical items for the siege.

“Mahmud, also called Abu Hanadzalah, was being sought by the Malaysian authorities for ties to global terrorists,” Mr. Banlaoi said. “He has been identified as a militant recruiter for the I.S.,” he added, using the initials of the Islamic State.

He said that among the people Mr. Ahmad had helped to go to the Middle East was Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki, who drove a car packed with bombs into an Iraqi police headquarters, killing 25 people in 2014.

While Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Hapilon may have died, there are other militant leaders waiting to emerge, Mr. Banlaoi said.

“I.S. may have lost a very valuable conduit in Mindanao with the reported death of Mahmud,” he said. “His death can severely affect financing terrorism in the region. However, threats of attacks from other terror groups remain imminent. It’s not yet over.”

More than 200,000 residents are crammed into refugee camps, waiting for the military to declare an official end to the operation.

The battle in Marawi has been financially draining and has tested the abilities of one of the region’s most poorly equipped armies.

LOS ANGELES — There were multiple options for experiencing “A (for 100 Cars),” a new composition by Ryoji Ikeda that had its premiere here late Sunday afternoon.

Image Credit Andrew White for The New York Times

You could look and see 100 tricked-out cars arranged in a phalanx on the roof of a parking lot across the street from Frank Gehry’s Walt Disney Hall, many with their doors open and angled up to the sky. You could listen to the sometimes sharp, sometimes guttural tones that were pealing from their speakers, each a variation on the standard tuning of the note A. Or you could close your eyes and feel how the music pushed against the ears, the head, the skin, throbbing and droning and crashing.

“A (for 100 Cars)” was, by turns, a placid deliberation, a thunderous roar, an ambitious lark. A public sound art installation made possible through corporate largess — the performance was part of the first Los Angeles edition of the Red Bull Music Academy festival — it turned negative space in the center of downtown Los Angeles into a sublime womb. All around, tall buildings loomed, while on the performance stage, 100 cars worked through what felt like a meditation.

Mr. Ikeda’s composition juxtaposed precision and imprecision: 440Hz is the current tuning standard for A, but that wasn’t always the case. Each car here was paired with a historical tuning, with frequencies ranging from 376.3Hz to 506.9Hz. Also, though this composition could have been performed cleanly by computer, it instead relied on amateur performers — the drivers, who in many cases were the creative and technical architects of their cars, but in this case were also the musicians. Each had a pocket-size synthesizer programmed to one specific frequency and a dedicated score instructing him or her how to manipulate the knobs at various points in the 27-minute piece.

“It’s impossible to follow, exactly, the timing,” Mr. Ikeda said after the performance. But he added: “All the drivers were so serious. I was kind of underestimating them.”

The influential photographer Estevan Oriol was in the front row with his lovingly-detailed 1964 Chevrolet Impala SS lowrider. “I’m trying to expand our car culture,” he said. “The lowrider community for the most part only do lowrider community-related stuff. I never even heard of anything like this.”

Among the 100 cars, the lowriders stood out for their candy-bright paint. But plenty of unassuming vehicles with astonishing sound systems participated as well. “Some cars look normal, but inside is like a weapon,” Mr. Ikeda said.

Even the most vibrant speaker systems were tested by Mr. Ikeda’s bulbous tones, which pushed their speakers in directions they’d not previously gone. “Each frequency coming though my speakers, I’d never heard,” said Jasond Moody, behind the wheel of his supercharged 2011 Chevrolet Camaro SS. (Each driver was outfitted with huge headphones.) “If you got a 4 kilowatt sound system and you’re playing 55 Hz at 120 decibels, physically, it’s a real kind of experience,” said Tatsuya Takahashi, who built the synthesizers. “What the driver is feeling in the driver’s seat is very different than what the audience hears.”

Mr. Ikeda’s composition wasn’t limited to the stereo systems; it also took advantage of the cars’ headlights, horns and roaring engines. Though in the case of one car, the revving proved to be too much. Just as the performance was coming to a close, Edwin Hammond Meredith’s 1978 Cadillac DeVille began billowing out smoke from under its hood: Clamps securing a hose to the radiator had blown off.

Other drivers and mechanics rushed to help, some pouring bottles of water down the side of the car to keep things cool. Like the sound bath that had just finished, the acrid scent spread through the air with slow determination, making this a concert you could hear, see, feel and also smell.

“If, like me, you love your local neighborhood stores, your bakeries, your cafes, your clothing stores, all these things, then you need to spend your money there and not at Starbucks and not at other alternative places,” he said, to applause from the audience in northwest Brooklyn.

“A lot of this is economic and consumer-choice-based,” Mr. de Blasio said, shortly after his administration released a raft of documents, including a letter from the mayor, outlining why Amazon should base its operations in the five boroughs. “So a lot of people are turning to Amazon and other online options, that’s one of the underlying factors.”

Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group that supported the city’s Amazon bid, said the mayor’s comments looked to be at odds with the city’s public courting of the retailer.

“When the mayor sends this kind of mixed message, it appears that he does not think his words matter,” she said.

A spokesman for Starbucks pointed to the roughly 8,000 people employed by the company in New York City and the benefits they receive, including health coverage, and to efforts like a voting drive in Jamaica, Queens, and hosting meetings between police officers and New Yorkers in its coffee shops.

“We welcome the mayor to join us for any of these happening regularly in his hometown,” the spokesman, Reggie Borges, said in an email.

The mayor, as well as his aides and supporters, have defended Mr. de Blasio’s stances as a reflection of his true self, and say that anything else would be pandering or false. Some find his honesty — especially when it comes to the Yankees, who can cause headaches for many New Yorkers — to be refreshing in a politician.

“I’m not going to fake anything,” Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday at an unrelated news conference. “I’m going to be myself. They’ll have their games and if they win in the end, we will honor them.”

When the mayor adamantly told reporters at the outdoor event that he would not attend a game if the Yankees made it to the World Series, a fan standing nearby shouted: “The city takes precedence!”

After the news conference, the fan, Jerry Urcivoli, 45, said he was aghast that the mayor would put his loyalty to the Red Sox ahead of his role as mayor.

“You don’t put that aside and say, ‘That’s my personal belief and I should go as a representative of Manhattan and New York City’?” Mr. Urcivoli said. “It’s disgraceful the mayor’s not going.”

It did seem only recently that Mr. de Blasio was open to finally checking off a few boxes on his personal mayoral to-do list.

Last month, the mayor attended the opening night gala at the Metropolitan Opera, where “Norma” was performed. It was his first visit to that event. The next day, he visited the High Line for the first time.

But with polls showing him with a 44 percentage point lead over his closest challenger, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican assemblywoman, Mr. de Blasio seems to be digging in again.

“I am a crazed, rabid baseball fan and Red Sox fan,” Mr. de Blasio told The Daily News editorial board on Tuesday. “It is constitutionally impossible to quote unquote root for the New York Yankees.”

It may also speak to both the nature of fandom and to the particularities of his deep devotion to the home team of Boston, where Mr. de Blasio grew up.

“Expectations would be that even when people move to new environments they tend to pick up the allegiance of the team,” said Edward R. Hirt, a professor of psychology at Indiana University in Bloomington, who studies sports fandom and social identity. “If you were the mayor of that community and wanting to build community spirit you’d want to be seen as identifying with that.”

“It is seemingly a head-scratcher,” he added.

Mr. de Blasio’s challengers in the mayoral race were less confused.

“Unconscionable,” Ms. Malliotakis told reporters Thursday.

“If you don’t like the Yankees, you don’t like being in New York,” said Bo Dietl, an independent candidate for mayor who attended Wednesday night’s game, seated behind home plate. “He should not be the mayor of this great city. It just shows his narcissism.”

As for Amazon, Mr. Dietl said he does not use the site, a rare point of harmony with Mr. de Blasio. “I like touchy-feely. I like to go to a store and look at what I’m going to buy,” he said.

Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant and Mets fan, said that past mayors have been rabid in their New York fandom — as Rudolph W. Giuliani was for the Yankees — or uninterested in sports and supportive of the local team, as was the case with Ed Koch and with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Boston native who grew up a Red Sox fan but rooted for the Yankees against his childhood team as mayor.

“As a baseball fan who also doesn’t like the Yankees, I’m following it with interest,” Mr. Skurnik said. But he added, “I don’t think any significant number of voters use this as a guide to who they’re going to vote for.”",What May Seem Good for New York Is Not Always Good for Its Mayor,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/nyregion/de-blasio-yankees-amazon-mayor.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“It’s what sold me on Columbia — how could I go anywhere else?” said Kyle Lindsey McCormick, a second-year medical student and one of the group’s co-presidents.

Incorporating the arts into medical school curriculums is an increasingly popular trend. The arts and humanities initiative at Harvard Medical School includes a collaboration with American Repertory Theater. Yale School of Medicine requires a course in which students observe paintings. But an extracurricular student-run theater company that produces a regular season is an anomaly.

“It enhances empathy and understanding and emotional intelligence of our students, and it translates into enhanced understanding for patients from other backgrounds and cultures,” said Dr. Lisa Mellman, the senior associate dean of student affairs at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.

Auditions are open to anyone on the medical campus, including nursing, dental and doctoral students, and everyone who wants to be involved earns a role, onstage or off. Dr. Donald O. Quest, a neurosurgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian, has played trombone in the orchestra pit for several shows, and Dr. Mellman has made cameos in some productions.

Dr. Jay H. Lefkowitch joined the Bard Hall Players in 1972, performing minor roles in musicals like “Anything Goes” and focusing on set design, employing his undergraduate degree in art. Now a pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian, he is the faculty adviser of the group and an impassioned supporter of the arts, speaking as knowledgeably about post-Sondheim musical theater as he does about intestinal cancers.

Bard Hall Players isn’t the only artistic group at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. The school has an a cappella group called The Ultrasounds. Each class has a band (The second year’s is called the Flu Fighters). There’s also a symphony, composed of students and staff.

Many students believe their artistic credentials helped them get into the school. Jenna Lanz, a second-year medical student and co-president of the Players, said Columbia was barely on her radar screen when she was applying to medical schools, because it was a stretch academically. But during her interview, she said, she talked about her theater experience and its connection to medicine.

“When you have the ability to see other people’s lives and put yourself into them, then it helps you serve them better and understand what they’re going through in a different way,” she said.

Bard Hall Players includes students have never acted before and those who have worked in the theater professionally. Ms. Boyle was an assistant stage manager at the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey. Ms. McCormick, who plays Cinderella, studied music and opera at Columbia as an undergraduate. James Lasky, who plays Cinderella’s Prince, is a former ballet dancer and model. Cory Chang, one of the production’s music directors, earned a master’s degree in collaborative piano from Eastman School of Music.

And some have had full-fledged careers in the arts. Dr. Michael Parker Ayers, who graduated in 2014 and is now a cardiology fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, acted professionally before attending Columbia. A few weeks after starting medical school in 2010, he received a call from the casting director for “West Side Story” on Broadway, asking if he was available to be the new standby for Tony. He ended up turning down the offer and joining the Players instead.

“When you’re a professional actor, your age and your look have to align with the character’s type,” said Dr. Ayers, noting that he enjoyed the chance to play roles like Pseudolus, the Roman slave, in the Bard Hall Players’ production of “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.”

“That’s a Nathan Lane type, and I’m 6 feet 2 inches and blond,” he said. “I got to do something that I would never have gotten to do in the professional theater world.”

Students often apply their medical training to their character development. When Ms. Boyle directed “Julius Caesar” her first year, she and the cast spoke often about how Caesar has epilepsy, “the falling sickness,” and how his confusion could be a result of a postictal state, the time following a seizure.

To prepare for “Into the Woods,” Kelseanne Breder, a PhD. nursing student specializing in psychology who plays the Witch decided that vertical trauma, the idea that suffering is carried across generations, is relevant to her character’s back story. The Witch’s mother left her when she was young and now she’s projecting by keeping her daughter Rapunzel in captivity.

The fourth-year medical student Nicole Curatola, who plays Jack’s Mother in “Into the Woods,” said theater has helped broaden her perspective on the medical profession.

“You get time to dive into the human experience,” Ms. Curatola said. “What do these characters represent? What do they go through? And a lot of times, you need to put yourself in the shoes of patients. It keeps you grounded in the human experience.”

Most of all, the students see the club as a way to relieve stress. At a recent evening rehearsal, the cast, dressed in a mix of street clothes and scrubs, stumbled through the choreography to the Act I finale, linking arms and skipping with abandon across the stage.

“Do you have an acronym for remembering these lyrics?” one of the performers asked, as if academic memorization methods could be applied to the musical.

In the end, it didn’t matter. People forgot the lyrics. People forgot the steps. But everyone was laughing. That’s the reason, according to Dr. Lefkowitch, the club has endured for 50 years. “It’s a source of sanity,” he said.","Scalpel, Sponge, Show Tunes: When Doctors Moonlight as Actors",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/theater/bard-hall-players-columbia-medical-students.html

But on an evening trip to the nearby town, he encounters an enigmatic and lovely red-haired woman. On a later visit, he learns that she is one of the members of a traveling theater troupe. His growing preoccupation with this woman adds to tensions on the work site, fueled by Cem’s irrational jealousy of his master’s imagined involvement with her.

Pamuk has a masterly control of mood in this section of the novel, and its sometimes stilted language seems apt for his half-formed, often arrogant, intellectually and sexually curious young narrator. Indeed, at this point the novel is so gripping and accomplished that when the married actress chooses to commit adultery with Cem, whom she has only just met, I was able to suspend my disbelief. “The heart wants what it wants,” I shrugged, channeling Woody Allen. But many years later, when the woman discloses the relationship that underlies her interest in this callow youth, I found myself thinking of another humorist, Mark Twain, who observed that although fiction must be plausible, truth needn’t be. Alas, it’s not the only time Pamuk reaches into the grab-bag of improbable coincidences and pulls out an unlikelihood that strains reasonable bounds.

When Cem’s romantic distraction leads to an accident at the well site, he must make a moral choice of awesome consequence — one that he realizes will shape the rest of his life. As he reaches his decision, the story begins to crumble. The second and third sections of the novel become nothing more than clunky melodrama laced with ever-greater implausibility and snarled in repetitive references to the two classic stories of patricide and filicide until the foreshadowing becomes positively penumbral.

Influenced by his well-digging father figure, Cem discards his writing dreams to study engineering and geology. In adulthood, he is able to enrich himself on the back of Istanbul’s expansion and building boom. Here Pamuk flits like a barn swallow over fascinating issues of contemporary Turkish life, but never alights long enough to offer interesting insights or even substantially enrich the story.

Worse, as Cem matures his narrative voice doesn’t grow up with him. I began to wonder if what I had been admiring as purposefully inelegant expression in the service of an authentic adolescent voice wasn’t something different: careless prose or an awkward translation. There’s a tiredness to the language: Curiosity is piqued, suspicions are sneaking, people stare dumbstruck, clouds are low and leaden.

A change of voice, when the red-haired woman assumes the narration in the last section of the novel, might have offered a chance to regain the moody tension of the opening chapters. But instead the melodrama amplifies to an appallingly hackneyed crescendo. And an unoriginal one: Like the murderous miniaturist in Pamuk’s earlier novel, “My Name Is Red,” a killer in “The Red-Haired Woman” also disposes of a body in — where else? — the bottom of a well.

Reviewing that capacious and ambitious earlier novel for The New Yorker in 2001, John Updike rather delicately observed that Pamuk’s desire to write in the 19th-century tradition, to access “a more generous, less nibbled attention span,” to breathe “with bigger lungs” and write “long, deep and wide” might not be entirely suited to his “relatively short-winded” style.

Maybe. But for this reader, even the relative sprint of Pamuk’s slim book seemed unsustainable.","In Orhan Pamuk’s New Novel, a Youthful Obsession Yields a Haunted Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/books/review/red-haired-woman-orhan-pamuk.html

So many people want to believe sexual harassment is only a Hollywood problem or a Silicon Valley problem when, in fact, sexual harassment happens in every single industry. There is no escaping the inappropriate attentions and intentions of men.

These same people buy into the myth that there are ways women can avoid sexual violence and harassment — if we act nicer or drink less or dress less provocatively or smile or show a little gratitude or, or, or — because boys will be boys, because men are so fragile, so frenzied with sexual need that they cannot simply control themselves and their baser impulses.

Some people insinuate that women themselves can stave off attacks. They insist we can wear modest clothes or be grateful for unconventional looks, or that we can avoid “asking for it” by “presenting all the sensuality and the sexuality,” as Donna Karan has said. With each of these betrayals, the burden we all carry grows heavier.

What this reasoning does not grapple with — and it is a perennial rejoinder to discussions of sexual assault and women’s vulnerability — is that no one escapes unwanted male attention because they don’t meet certain beauty standards or because they don’t dress a certain way. They escape because they are lucky.

Sexual violence is about power. There is a sexual component, yes, but mostly it’s about someone exerting his or her will over another and deriving pleasure and satisfaction from that exertion. We cannot forget this, or the women and men who have been harassed or assaulted but aren’t “conventionally attractive” will be ignored, silenced, or worse, disbelieved.

And then there are the ways that women diminish their experiences as “not that bad.” Because it was just a cat call. It was just a man grabbing me. It was just a man shoving me up against a wall. It was just a man raping me. He didn’t have a weapon. He stopped following me after 10 blocks. He didn’t leave many bruises. He didn’t kill me, therefore it is not that bad. Nothing I deal with in this country compares with what women in other parts of the world deal with. We offer up this refrain over and over because that is what we need to tell ourselves, because if we were to face how bad it really is, we might not be able to shoulder the burden for one moment longer.

In the wake of the Weinstein allegations, a list appeared online, an anonymous accounting of men in media who have committed a range of infractions from sleazy DMs to rape. And just as quickly as the list appeared, it disappeared. I saw the list. A couple of people didn’t belong on it simply because their behaviors weren’t sexual in nature, but some of them were men whose behavior called for a warning and who deserved public shame. Even where I live, outside the media bubble, in a small town in Indiana, I had already heard some of the stories that were shared.

There are a great many open secrets about bad men.

As the list circulated, there was a lot of hand-wringing about libel and the ethics of anonymous disclosure. There was so much concern for the “good men,” who, I guess we’re supposed to believe, would be harmed by the mere existence of an accounting of alleged bad men. There was concern that the “milder” infractions would be conflated with the more serious ones, as if women lack the capacity for critical thinking and discernment about behaviors that are or are not appropriate in professional contexts. More energy was spent worrying about how men were affected than worrying about the pain women have suffered. Women were not trusted to create a tangible artifact of their experiences so that they might have more to rely upon than the whisper networks women have long cultivated to warn one another about the bad men they encounter.

Meanwhile, there was a hashtag, #metoo — a chorus of women and some men sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and assault. Me too, me too, me too. I thought about participating but I was just too tired. I have nothing more to say about my history of violence beyond saying I have been hurt, almost too many times to count. I have been hurt enough that some terrible things no longer even register as pain.

We already know victims’ stories. Women testify about their hurt, publicly and privately, all the time. When this happens, men, in particular, act shocked and surprised that sexual violence is so pervasive because they are afforded the luxury of oblivion. And then they start to panic because not all men are predators and they don’t want to be lumped in with the bad men and they make women’s pain all about themselves. They choose not to face that enough men are predators that women engage in all sorts of protective behaviors and strategies so that they might stop adding to their testimony. And then there are the men who act so overwhelmed, who ask, “What can I possibly do?”

The answer is simple.

Men can start putting in some of the work women have long done in offering testimony. They can come forward and say “me too” while sharing how they have hurt women in ways great and small. They can testify about how they have cornered women in narrow office hallways or made lewd comments to co-workers or refused to take no for an answer or worn a woman down by guilting her into sex and on and on and on. It would equally be a balm if men spoke up about the times when they witnessed violence or harassment and looked the other way or laughed it off or secretly thought a woman was asking for it. It’s time for men to start answering for themselves because women cannot possibly solve this problem they had no hand in creating.","Dear Men: It’s You, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/metoo-sexual-harassment-men.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband.
With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect.
Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.
“The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said.","Andre Martin and Renaud Wald made off with the paintings from the Louvre without triggering the dreaded “red procedure.” That’s the high-tech system that automatically seals exits and locks doors throughout the vast museum within two minutes of a security breach. The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

It would allow more Americans to sign up for very high-deductible insurance plans known as catastrophic insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The current law limits those plans to customers under 30 years old, or those who have demonstrated they cannot afford other insurance options.

The draft legislation would also ensure that the federal government assigns money for advertising about the Obamacare enrollment period and for hiring professionals to help customers select and sign up for plans; the money would be a portion of the fees it collects from insurers selling plans on HealthCare.gov.

The deal’s prospects in Congress remain uncertain. Though some senators from each party have endorsed its approach, several Republicans have spoken out against it. In the House, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan said that “the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare.”

But even if the deal moves forward quickly, it is unlikely to affect next year’s health plans. Carriers in most states have raised their prices substantially to make up for the canceled federal payments, and there is little time for them to lower them again if the payments are restored. (The draft bill tries to address this problem, by asking states to establish a new rebate program, where carriers who get paid twice would need to pay back the federal government.)

“For 2018, it probably won’t happen in time,” said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University, who monitors health legislation closely. “The carriers are thinking now about 2019, and it’s very important for 2019.”

Insurance plans for each year go on sale during the prior fall, but the process of devising plans and setting prices begins months earlier. This year, many current insurers announced their exits from the 2018 Obamacare markets months ago, some explicitly naming President Trump’s threats about the cost-sharing payments as a reason. Analysts said it was unclear whether the plan might lure reluctant insurers back into the markets, but they said the funding would cause many insurance premiums to fall in 2019.

But the lengthy planning process of insurers means that the proposed bill’s two-year funding cycle could lead to another round of price increases in 2020, if an extension bill isn’t passed far in advance. Many insurers had been hoping that the Alexander-Murray legislation would make the funding permanent.

While Mr. Trump has insisted he will not support any legislation that he believes to be a bailout to the insurers, policy experts say the insurers are getting only what they are due under the law. Because the insurers set the prices for their 2017 plans assuming they would receive the federal funding, the president’s decision represents more than $1 billion in lost payments, according to a recent analysis from Avalere Health, a consulting firm.

The funding has not contributed to outsize profits for the insurers selling individual policies under the law, in spite of Mr. Trump’s recent tweet about the insurers “who have made a fortune w/ O’Care.” “Most insurance companies have lost money trying to pursue these exchange markets,” said Dan Mendelson, Avalere’s president. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are not allowed to pocket more than 20 percent of their premium dollars for overhead and profits. If they earn more, they are required to return the excess to consumers through rebates.

The insurers generally lost money in the first three years of the Obamacare market, said Deep Banerjee, an analyst for Standard & Poor’s, though it appears they were faring better this year, before the cancellation of government payments. “It is not a market that has been profitable for them,” he said. While there are exceptions, most insurers are making their money in other insurance markets like the government programs Medicare and Medicaid as well as in the much larger employer market.

“It gives the market some measure of predictability,” Mr. Banerjee said, but he emphasized that the legislation “is not a permanent solution.” Much of what it does is restore the funding that already existed before President Trump’s announcement that he was cutting it off. “It’s not a huge additional support for the market.”","Bipartisan Health Proposal Is Too Late for 2018, but a Salve for 2019",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/upshot/bipartisan-health-proposal-is-too-late-for-2018-but-a-salve-for-2019.html

Forget about it.”The Police Department’s announcement that it was using phenotyping came amid fresh controversy over forensic DNA techniques.","Parabon’s tests revealed that Monique was primarily of sub-Saharan African descent, and not white as investigators had believed based on the color of the skin found on her remains.

Analysts used her sex and ancestry to create a generic sketch of a face from a database of demographic information, which they overlaid with traits gleaned from her genes: a deep brown complexion and brown eyes above a round nose.

As murder rates hover at historic lows, the Police Department is looking to emerging technologies like phenotyping to help solve old cases. The hope is that seeing a victim’s likeness will jog people’s memories. Deputy Chief Emanuel J. Katranakis, the commander of the Forensic Investigation Division, said the police have received several tips since releasing the likenesses of Monique and a male victim in another case in September.

But critics have raised concerns about the lack of peer-reviewed science behind the technology and the creeping expansion of how DNA is collected and used in criminal investigations, where it is susceptible to human bias, error and abuse.

Police officials have said they are focused on using phenotyping to help identify victims, though they have not ruled out using it to search for suspects. But relying on so few traits requires the police to cast a wide net, said Robert Perry, the legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

“The problem is, its use will place actual people, innocent of wrongdoing, under criminal suspicion without any basis in fact or science,” he said.

Chief Katranakis said that criticism overlooks phenotyping’s ability to help the police avoid targeting the wrong people in their investigations. “The power of exclusion from phenotyping is greater than that of inclusion,” he said.

For example, he said, the Police Department used the technique to determine that the suspect in the 2016 murder of a Queens jogger, Karina Vetrano, was of African descent and eventually arrested a suspect, Chanel Lewis, who is black.

Dozens of law enforcement agencies in places like Louisiana and North Carolina have similarly used phenotyping to search for suspects in cases where investigators had exhausted traditional leads.

But New York regulators say any private lab seeking to perform testing on DNA samples from New York must have authorization from state health officials.

Chief Katranakis said state approval was not necessary because the Police Department was not using the technique to identify specific individuals. But the state Department of Health said Parabon is required to obtain a license to perform phenotyping on DNA samples from New York.

The agency sent Parabon a warning last month, and Ben Rosen, a Health Department spokesman, said the company is currently seeking a permit. In an interview, Dr. Steven L. Armentrout, Parabon’s chief executive, declined to comment on the issue.

DNA testing has been around for decades, popularized on television and in the criminal justice system for its usefulness in determining paternity and ancestry. DNA collected from crime scenes is routinely used to identify suspects and to convict or exonerate the accused, usually by comparing it to a suspect’s DNA or samples in a criminal database.

Increasingly, geneticists have been discovering ways to use variations to predict specific physical traits. The potential applications might someday include allowing doctors to detect genetic diseases by scanning a patient’s face.

Parabon boasts that its Snapshot service, which police officials said cost $4,000 to $5,000 for each case, “accurately predicts the physical appearance and ancestry of an unknown person from DNA.”

Although interest in its testing has grown, Parabon has yet to publish its detailed methodology for peer review.

Much of the science around how genetics determines facial appearance has focused on the role of individual genes. But Dr. Armentrout said Parabon’s facial predictions are based on its research on how genes work together to shape the face.

“For a complex trait, this is unequivocally the way genetics works,” he said.

But critics say the company is promising more than science has determined it can deliver. Dr. Yaniv Erlich, a computer science professor at Columbia University who studies genetics, said the idea that phenotyping could meaningfully predict something as complex as individual looks is “on the verge of science fiction.”

“Ancestry?” he said. “Sure, that’s fairly simple. Kinship, too. Phenotyping with faces? Forget about it.”

The Police Department’s announcement that it was using phenotyping came amid fresh controversy over forensic DNA techniques. The state inspector general is reviewing a request from criminal defense attorneys to investigate methods used for several years by the city medical examiner’s office, an inquiry that could have implications for thousands of prosecutions.

Among scientists, the idea that phenotyping can predict faces has provoked debate. A geneticist was criticized for a recently published paper in which he claimed to be able to identify anonymous people’s faces by sequencing their genes. Reviewers and a co-author said the paper, which was intended to raise privacy concerns, overstated what was achieved.

Dr. Erlich wrote that most of the trait predictions, such as height and face shape, were made using simple demographic data rather than trait-specific markers. “It is like the authors needed to get to the supermarket and decided to build a spacecraft to make the trip,” he said.

Even amid such debates, the role of DNA in criminal investigations continues to expand in New York. The state Commission on Forensic Science, which approves methods used in state crime labs, adopted guidelines for familial testing — DNA searches for relatives of potential suspects – that took effect Wednesday, despite protests from criminal defense and civil liberties lawyers.

The Legal Aid Society, in a brief filed with the commission, said that the panel, which was lobbied by the police, prosecutors and Ms. Vetrano’s family, does not have the authority to implement familial DNA testing.

Allison Lewis, a staff attorney in Legal Aid’s DNA unit, and David Loftis, the attorney in charge of post-conviction and forensic litigation, said the expanded roles of DNA in the criminal justice system in recent years go far beyond what the Legislature had in mind when it adopted laws compelling people convicted of certain crimes to submit swabs.

They warned that without clear rules from lawmakers, the technology will be used to justify something akin to stop-and-frisk, where people in black and Latino communities are targeted for genetic surveillance, regardless of whether they are suspected of a crime.

Chief Katranakis said the Police Department was “fully aware” of the uncertainty surrounding phenotyping. Officials conducted a thorough evaluation of the science behind it and consulted with industry experts before deeming it appropriate for use in a limited number of cases where investigators have nothing to work with, he said.

Nothing is what the police had when a man’s skull was found in July 2005 in a community garden in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The teeth had been removed, preventing investigators from identifying the victim with dental records. Phenotyping analysts created an image from his DNA and adjusted it to his skull shape, getting closer to what he looked like, Chief Katranakis said.

Investigators found the victim’s torso in a trash bin in East Williamsburg and traced it to 128 Gates Avenue in Bushwick, near where an accused serial killer lived when two of his teenage neighbors disappeared. Their bodies were found dismembered in 2004 and 2005.

Since 2006, most online political activity has been exempt from the rigorous regulations to which paid television, radio and print political advertising has been subject for years. The Federal Election Commission justified the so-called internet exemption rule by declaring the internet “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.”

That attitude has many fewer adherents after the revelations that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, Facebook sold more than $100,000 worth of ads to a Russian company linked to the Kremlin, while Google sold at least $4,700 worth of ads to accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government.

Federal election law bars foreigners from spending money to try to influence United States elections.

“It’s ridiculous,” said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served on the election commission from 2013 until this year. “We need to rethink all the exemptions for the internet because even if Facebook might not have known about the Russian advertising, they knew — and we all knew — that this was possible.”

The new bill would require internet companies to provide information to the election commission about who is paying for online ads.

The content and purchasers of the Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook and Google in 2016 “are a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology,” Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Warner said.

The regulatory pressure comes at a particularly trying time for Google, Facebook and other tech giants. The companies, once celebrated as benevolent drivers of innovation and economic growth, are facing mounting criticism on both sides of the Atlantic for complex tax avoidance efforts, the hosting of pages used in sex trafficking, lax privacy protections and increasing monopoly power.

In response, they have ramped up lobbying and public relations campaigns, with Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, last week whirring through Washington on an apology tour and charm offensive.

Yet government officials working on the investigations into the Russian-funded ads and the efforts to enact stricter disclosure requirements say Facebook and Google have been less than enthusiastic partners.

After initially resisting requests to turn over Russian-linked ads, Facebook has provided them to a congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But Google has yet to do so, and neither company has made the ads public.

And in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the Klobuchar-Warner-McCain bill, Facebook told congressional aides that it is too difficult to figure out if an ad is political or commercial because candidates are often changing messages and topics. The company added that with the sheer number of ads on the site, the engineering involved in identifying political ads would be extremely challenging.

When the Federal Election Commission moved to strengthen its online disclaimer requirements in 2011 and again last year, the companies either ignored requests for input or suggested that new rules could “stand in the way of innovation,” as Facebook asserted in a 2011 comment to the commission.

Around that time, both companies paid Perkins Coie to seek exemptions from the election commission to one of the few election rules that do apply to online political activity — that political ads placed on third-party websites contain disclaimers revealing who paid for them. The exemption requests, written by Mr. Elias, the head of Perkins Coie’s political law practice, argued that it was impractical to require disclaimers on ads the size of those then being offered on Google and Facebook.

While the election commission approved Google’s request, which was submitted in 2010, by a 4-to-2 vote, it deadlocked 3 to 3 on Facebook’s request, which was submitted the next year. Facebook nonetheless proceeded as if it was exempt from the disclaimer requirement, declining to mandate that political advertisements on its platform list their sponsors.

Such disclaimers and other disclosure requirements might have helped deter the Russian-funded ads and other online efforts to meddle in the election, say advocates for stricter campaign finance rules. Mr. Elias went on to help lead research into Russian efforts to help Donald J. Trump and damage Mrs. Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.

It was “kind of like the chickens coming home to roost,” said Ms. Ravel, the former commissioner.

She argued that since Facebook was not granted an exemption to the disclaimer requirements, it should have required advertisements to include disclaimers for the past half-dozen years. But referring to Mr. Elias, she said that “the savvy political insiders understand that there is not going to be any enforcement from the F.E.C.” because the commission has frequently deadlocked along partisan lines over enforcement matters in recent years.

Mr. Elias rejected suggestions that he helped Russia hurt Mrs. Clinton.

“Russia found a number of ways to aid Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, and the F.E.C. disclaimers would not have stopped them,” he said. The ads in question would not have required the disclaimers, he said, because — according to Facebook — they did not explicitly mention Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton or the election. In a blog post, Facebook wrote that the ads focused on amplifying “divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”

Citing United States intelligence findings that Russia was behind the hacking and dissemination of damaging emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Mr. Elias said, “The Russians were willing to break the law to help Donald Trump. I doubt the F.E.C. disclaimers were going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Critics are not accepting that. Google and Facebook had ample opportunity to work with the Federal Election Commission to devise and put in place effective and practical disclaimer rules, “but they were silent,” said Lawrence M. Noble, a former general counsel for the election commission who now serves in that position with the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics.

“And they are still trying to avoid regulation,” Mr. Noble said.

A Facebook official said that the company would submit comments to the election commission as it considers tightening its disclaimer rules.

And the company’s vice president for United States public policy, Erin Egan, said, “We look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution” to “achieve transparency in political advertising.”

She pointed out that the company had enacted new policies to self-police its ads, which Facebook asserted in a company blog post “would have caught these malicious actors faster and prevented more improper ads from running” in 2016.

Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said that strict ads policies, including limits on political-ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion, already exist at Google. But the company is “taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries.”",Senators Demand Online Ad Disclosures as Tech Lobby Mobilizes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/facebook-google-russia-meddling-disclosure.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — When you’ve had a busy or a tough week — a week where it feels as if your hair is on fire — your best bet is to find a distraction. Ideally, this distraction should be good for you (or at least not terribly harmful) and should allow you to focus hard on it so that you can temporarily displace thoughts about what kindled that hair fire to begin with.

My own go-to distractions are running, reading, cooking and knitting. When I really need to distract myself and focus down, I enjoy British-style cryptic crosswords. I’m sure you have your own distractions.

My point is, once the hair fire is extinguished and the smoke settles, you deserve a reward for making it through. The Venn diagram of “distractions from hair fires” and “rewards” probably overlaps quite a bit, but in my opinion, sitting down on a Friday with a lovely beverage and a Patrick Berry themeless crossword is one of the best ways to end the week. I put that firmly in the rewards circle.

Mr. Berry can bring some fresh entries to his grids and bring back entries that have not been seen for a while. The middle section — BARBARA JORDAN, SOCIAL STUDIES and ACCOUNT HOLDER — is O.K. in terms of liveliness, but those are all debuts, so bonus points there.

In the years since the financial crisis, the largest United States financial institutions churned out profits largely thanks to a booming business in trading and structuring bonds and other securities. Advising corporations and other institutions on their finances and strategies was another lucrative revenue stream.

Now, though, those businesses are flagging, in part because financial markets have been eerily calm.

So banks are turning more to lending to consumers — especially through credit cards — to pick up some of the slack.

Banks earn money from credit cards in two ways: They take a small cut of each card transaction as a fee, and they typically charge annual interest rates of 15 percent or more on balances that customers don’t pay off at the end of each month.

That business model is increasingly lucrative. Many consumers, their wages stagnant and their costs rising, are growing reliant on credit cards for essential goods and services, including medical and dental care. Across the industry, profits rose in the latest quarter.

At Bank of America, credit and debit card spending is up 7 percent this year compared with last. “Consumers are spending,” Brian T. Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call last week. The bank’s chief financial officer noted that the company’s cards business enjoyed better growth “than we’ve experienced in quite some time.”

Rivals are experiencing a similar surge. A strong consumer business, including card growth, helped JPMorgan increase its profits last quarter despite declines in traditional profit engines such as trading.

At Citigroup, an exclusive card deal with Costco — in which the bank provides branded credit cards to the discount-retail giant — has been “a real winner,” said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. He said customers were spending more on their Costco cards and rolling over larger balances.

Such surprisingly strong performances — the four leading banks raked in a total of $21 billion in profits during the third quarter — helped propel shares of banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America to their highest levels in years.

Spending on plastic is part of a broader debt bonanza. In May, total household debt levels hit a post-recession peak of $12.7 trillion.

The rising numbers reflect a growing economy and a robust financial system able to provide credit to people who need it, banking officials and analysts say.

“Delinquencies on credit cards have stayed remarkably low for five years. They’ve been well below their historical averages,” said James Chessen, the chief economist for the American Bankers Association. “We attribute that to consumers continuing to be very smart about how they use their cards, and very careful about how much debt they take.”

But what’s good for banks and their shareholders isn’t necessarily good for all bank customers.

Cynthia Regis, 73, worked for more than two decades as a home health care aide but has virtually no savings. To help pay her electric bill and to buy groceries, she racked up a balance of more than $6,000 on a Discover credit card. The annual interest rate is 29 percent, which makes it hard for her to whittle down her outstanding balance. One month this year, for example, her payment of $159 mostly covered her interest payments, shaving only $5 off her total debt.

“I’m barely making it,” Ms. Regis said.

Many Americans have seen their savings winnowed by a combination of the recession and stagnant wages. Almost half of adults said they could not pay for a $400 expense without selling something or borrowing money, the Federal Reserve has found. Some 44 percent of people with credit cards are currently carrying a balance, according to the American Bankers Association’s latest quarterly analysis, up 1.7 percentage points from the same period two years ago.

Older Americans, like Ms. Regis and Ms. Murray, living on a fixed income, are turning to credit cards to make ends meet, according to economists, lawyers and other experts.

“These cards are a social safety net,” said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan. He said he has seen thousands of clients made insolvent by a single unexpected cost.

For borrowers with shaky credit, interest rates can near 36 percent. Some borrowers end up owing more in interest than they originally spent on their cards.

Just making the minimum monthly payments on her cards costs Ms. Murray $500. That eats up more than half of what she receives from Social Security.

The cost to borrowers is creeping upward. The average interest rate on new credit card offers currently hovers at 16.15 percent, the highest level in at least a decade, according to data collected by CreditCards.com.

For banks, this is especially welcome because relatively few borrowers appear to be at risk of default. That means the banks pocket big fees and interest payments with minimal costs.

“A lot of the signs we look for in terms of the deterioration of the consumer, I’ve got to say, right now, we just don’t see,” Michael L. Corbat, Citigroup’s chief executive, told analysts last week. “We would rate the health of the consumer right now as pretty good.”

But a few small cracks are starting to show. Most of the major banks increased the amount of money they put aside to cover possible credit-card defaults in the most recent quarter. The recent spate of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, took a toll, and all of the banks expect to see their rate of defaulted loans rise in the coming months.

A recent analysis of Federal Reserve data by the debt-rating firm Moody’s found that working-class families, those with a median income of about $33,000, were starting to spend a higher portion of their income — slightly more than 15 percent — on debt payments, compared with what they spent three years earlier. As other expenses like health care and housing rise, more of those families are at risk of falling behind on their debts, it warned.

Pearline Rivers-Sobers got a credit card from Synchrony Financial at a local chiropractor when her late husband needed treatment that she couldn’t afford. The card later came in handy when her son needed glasses. Then she got another and another. Soon her wallet was stuffed with cards from CareCredit, Modell’s Sporting Goods, Linens ’n Things, Toys “R” Us, Sleepy’s and Old Navy. (Despite the logos they carry, those cards are also issued by banks.)

For a while, she kept up on payments, even managing to pay off two cards. But she has fallen behind on payments to at least five different banks, including Citigroup and Capital One.

“I was spending each month scrounging together money that basically did not even pay the interest,” Ms. Rivers-Sobers said.

Now, she said, she is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The banks that issued her the cards are likely to receive a fraction of what she owes them.","A Boom in Credit Cards: Great News for Banks, Less So Consumers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/business/credit-cards-debt-banks.html

Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains — unlike computers — are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.

On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack — all while we should be performing the actual jobs we’re paid to be doing.

“Many people seem unaware that they might accomplish more with sustained, uninterrupted attention to one task,” said Nelson Cowan, a working memory specialist at the University of Missouri. “It can be exhilarating to flit from one conversation to another on Facebook, but people don’t realize what’s missing in the process. It’s like having a delicious soup poured on your head. Often the people who think they’re the best at sharing attention between tasks are actually missing the most.”

Mr. LeDoux added: “The brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.”

They’re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.

Repeat After Me

As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks — reading, or saying words over and over — continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we’re already convinced we’re productive.

New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It’s the easiest brain game there is.

Take Your Time

Forget cramming. It didn’t work in college, it doesn’t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.

Robert Bjork, the chair of U.C.L.A.’s psychology department, said that quickly stuffing facts into our brains leads us to forget them in the long term (he even filmed a YouTube video series on the subject). When you rehearse knowledge and practice it often, it sticks, research has shown. So if you can incorporate what you’re trying to remember into daily life, ideally over time, your chances of retaining it drastically improve.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the “forgetting curve.”

To get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.

Sit Down and Stay Put

Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley’s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?

“The rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,” Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.

Multiple studies have found that procrastination leads to stress and downright kills focus. Stop engaging in useless tasks like surfing the web and just tackle whatever it is you need to work on. Then watch your focus soar and your memory improve. Dr. Cowan said both perform better when they aren’t cheating on each other pursuing so-called “life hacks.”

Incentivize Moments and Read Cues

Minds wander constantly. For students, adding frequent tests incentivizes focus because they know they’ll be quizzed. Harvard researchers report this approach decreases daydreaming by 50 percent, improving the result.

Daniel Schacter, a psychologist and a co-author of the Harvard study who also wrote “The Seven Sins Of Memory,” said the trick is focus. For some tasks, like online surfing, divided attention sounds harmless, but when we’re behind the wheel, it’s anything but. That forgetfulness can change the course of entire lives, the most serious vulnerability of memory, he added.

Mr. Schacter suggests employing cues — visual or verbal for items like keys — to associate places and things. And our electronic devices can help remind us, everything from mobile vaccination and immunization alerts to apps like Waze that can remind you that you left your baby in the car. It can sound silly, but it’s also tragic when we fail.

“Memory is very cue dependent,” he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. “Most say it could never happen to me, but it’s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don’t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.”

He added: “The really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.”

A simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you’re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.

“A lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,” Mr. Schacter said. “Doing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you’re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you’re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.”",Simple Ways to Be Better at Remembering,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/smarter-living/simple-ways-to-be-better-at-remembering.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Many survivors suffer from “post-Ebola syndrome” — debilitating muscle and joint pain, headaches, fatigue, hearing loss and other lingering ills, sometimes even seizures.

A Virus That Lurks in the Eye

Like the patients he is now trying to help, Dr. Crozier was blinded in one eye by uveitis and recovered — but then lost his sight a second time, to a cataract. He had surgery in March.

His eye disease, described on May 7, 2015, in The New England Journal of Medicine, put the world on alert. Nearly two months after he had seemingly recovered from Ebola, and after his blood was free of it, severe uveitis suddenly developed — and Dr. Yeh was stunned to find that the fluid inside Dr. Crozier’s eye was teeming with active virus. At that time, uveitis was also emerging in West Africa.

Even though the virus may still lurk inside the eye in survivors with uveitis, it is not on the surface or in tears, so patients cannot spread Ebola through casual contact. But operating on them might pose a risk to surgeons who open the eye.

Eventually, the immune system seems to eliminate the virus, but no one knows how long that takes. Eighteen months after the virus was first found inside Dr. Crozier’s eye, a repeat test was negative. But when the virus level actually dropped is not known.

Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health and Sanitation was eager for Emory’s help, according to Dr. Kwame Oneill, who manages its Comprehensive Program for Ebola Survivors.

“After Ian became ill and had complications, he became a pioneer, a rallying point,” Dr. Oneill said. “Ian’s story was the turning point for survivors.”

The eye hospital in Freetown also welcomed the researchers. Dr. Lowell Gess, who founded the hospital in 1982, had recognized that uveitis was a severe problem in many patients. In 2015, during the epidemic, Dr. Gess, who was 94, began alerting Ebola treatment centers to the condition and recommending medications for it.

How many survivors have eye trouble is not known. Many live in far-flung provinces and have lost touch with health authorities. But a volunteer group, the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors, has tried to find patients who need help, and has helped pay for travel and lodging so they could consult the doctors from Emory.

Like so much of the exuberant food imagery that I’m drawn to in anime, the katsudon in “Yuri!!! on Ice,” a series about a competitive figure skater in his early 20s, appeared as a less detailed but somehow more vivid version of itself. A Japanese rice bowl capped with golden slices of pork cutlet, held together with barely cooked eggs and translucent onions — textures exaggerated, colors saturated, aromas made visible — occasionally twinkling in soft focus, as if seen through a Vaseline-greased lens. “Is this what God eats?!” one character asked another, trembling, cheeks flushed, eyes wide with the shock of its pleasure. What I love about food in anime is the truth in its hyperbole.

I meant to watch just one episode of the 12-part first season when it came out last fall on some streaming sites. My friend Whitney had told me I’d love it, but I didn’t realize how much: I stayed up and watched them all, more and more charmed and hungry. At first, Yuri is anxious. And he makes mistakes when he’s anxious, and he tortures himself over those mistakes. When he’s celebrating a win, or stuck in a professional slump, he finds comfort in katsudon. “Yuri” devotees from all over the world were quick to recreate his favorite dish at home, posting photos of their versions online like ephemeral fan art. They styled the dishes faithfully, with an addition of peas (at the fictional hot-springs inn that Yuri’s parents run in Kyushu, the dish is served with peas). By the time I finished the series, I wanted to do the same, so I asked Whitney to come over for dinner.

The foundation of the dish is tonkatsu, a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet that became popular in Japan by the early 20th century. Tonkatsu may have started out as an imitation of European-style cutlets — thin, flimsy slices of veal and lamb, sautéed in butter and served with a fork and a knife — but Japanese cooks soon owned it, revised it and deviated from the European recipes to develop their own style. By the 1920s, restaurants in Tokyo specialized in thick, evenly crisp cutlets, made from pork and deep-fried, often in lard. They served these in slices, so people could grasp them with chopsticks. Tonkatsu is now omnipresent, under heat lamps and behind glass at convenience stores, and on boards with shredded cabbage at high-end restaurants. In a Japanese home, it wouldn’t be unusual to have one or two in the fridge, like a leftover piece of fried chicken.

Katsudon is particularly helpful if you need to revive one of those cold, just-starting-to-sog cutlets, stretching it into a cheap, delicious meal. The simmering broth soaks into the breading, turning it juicy, drenching it with umami. But make it with a fresh, warm cutlet, and it’s even more rewarding. In his recipe for the dish in “Japanese Soul Cooking,” the chef Tadashi Ono suggested using pork shoulder or loin, so I bought some of both. After a generous salt and pepper, I dipped the cutlets in flour, egg and panko, the Japanese bread crumbs, and fried them in a wide cast-iron pan.

With a plastic mandoline, I shaved half an onion and put it in another pan with dashi, soy sauce and mirin, simmering it until the onion went floppy and translucent. I added ginger, because in her cookbook “Japanese Farm Food,” Nancy Singleton Hachisu writes about adding a little julienned raw ginger to her broth, before sliding the cutlets into the pan. While Whitney opened some beers, I cracked eggs into a small bowl, broke them up with a fork and poured them over the breading. Within a few minutes, the egg was set at the edges of the pan and the rice was ready. I piled everything in bowls and scattered some scallion on top.

There’s always a gap between how the food you make looks in real life and how you thought it might look based on the pictures. I was prepared for it when the katsudon didn’t emit its own light and twinkle cartoonishly, when it didn’t look anything like its perfect, airbrushed, animated muse.

Not much is known about the people who built the edifices, but they are thought to haveconstructed them at least 2,000 years ago and maybe as far back as 9,000 years ago, according to Dr. Kennedy has dated. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day Bedouin people in the region.

The most well-known of the basalt boulder structures are the “kites,” which were first identified by air pilots in the 1920s. Each looks like a child’s kite, complete with strings and long fluttering tails that are two-dimensionally flattened into the ground.

Archaeologists think ancient nomadic tribes used the kites, which can be more than a mile long, for hunting. The structure’s two long converging walls would funnel stampedes of gazelles into the body of the kite, where they would be slaughtered.

But the lava fields extend beyond Jordan’s borders into countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia. So do their mysteries. Saudi Arabia in particular offers a wealth of harrats that are just out of Dr. Kennedy’s reach.

“We would have loved to fly across into Saudi Arabia to take images. But you never get the permission,” he said. “And then along comes Google Earth.”

In 2004, Dr. Abdullah Al-Saeed, a neurologist and founder of the Desert Team, a group of amateur archaeologists in Saudi Arabia, explored the bleak lava field known as Harrat Khaybar. He saw walls of stones stacked about three feet high, but said that he did not appreciate their unique design at that time.

Then in 2008 he returned to the same spot from his desktop computer.

“When I saw the updated images of Harrat Khaybar from Google Earth, I was literally stunned and could not sleep that night,” Dr. Al-Saeed said in an email. “Flying like a bird all over the Harrat from one enigmatic structure to another! How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?”

He spoke to his colleagues, and they set out to investigate the most striking structure they saw in person. The Harrat Khaybar was more than 550 miles from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. So they took a plane to a nearby city, rented a car and set out for the volcanic domes. In order to navigate the rocky terrain, they had to do much of their exploration on foot through the lava field.

“The question we always discuss while investigating them is, why here? Why in this stony, frightful, rugged land?” he said. He snapped several photos and sent them along with the Google images to archaeologists like Dr. Kennedy for feedback.

“Absolute bafflement.” That’s what Dr. Kennedy said he felt when he first saw the satellite images. Suddenly, he was confronted with structures quite different from anything he had ever seen before. He called them gates because when looked at horizontally, they resemble a simple fence with two thick upright posts on the sides connected by one or more long bars.

“They don’t look like funerary, for disposing of dead bodies. They don’t look like structures where people lived, and they don’t look like animal traps,” he said. “I don’t know what they are.”

More Reporting on Archaeology

For nearly a decade, he has painstakingly cataloged nearly 400 gates. In 2011, his work was featured by Google in a video (for which he was paid). The longest gate he had identified was more than 1,600 feet long, though most were between 160 and 500 feet long. Sometimes the posts were as thick as 30 feet. One gate is intertwined with a kite.

Next he hopes to get accurate dating of the gates, which he suspects may in some cases be older than the kites, and perhaps the oldest man-made structures in the landscape. He invites armchair archaeologists to search the harrats online and share any finds with him.

“More will be found as more people get involved in scouring the landscape from satellite imagery,” he said.

Stephan Kempe, a retired professor of physical geology at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany, who was not involved in the paper, called the gate structures interesting and said that the new study was one of a series of papers describing previously unnoticed structures in the Saudi Arabian lava fields.

“There are many other features that have only recently been understood as forming classes of prehistoric ‘geoglyphs’ that were widespread in an area thought to be very barren and devoid of human impact,” he said in an email.

He added that he would have liked to have seen some suggestions from Dr. Kennedy as to what the gates may have been used for, if only to dissuade people from speculating as to extraterrestrial origins, as they have regarding the Sphinx and the Nazca Lines in Peru.

Despite the serious negotiations, there was no firm commitment that a compromise would reach the Senate floor if one could be struck. In fact, Mr. Alexander deferred to Mr. McConnell last month when Mr. McConnell wanted to take one last shot at overturning the health care law. He broke off his talks with Ms. Murray, resuming them only when the repeal effort faltered once again.

All sides agree that Mr. Trump — in conversations with Mr. Alexander and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader — strongly encouraged the bipartisan talks and initially seemed to embrace the agreement to restore the subsidies as a way to buy time for another repeal push. So backers of the plan were blindsided when the president said on Twitter on Wednesday that he could not back what he considered an insurance industry bailout.

Mr. Schumer said the president was undercutting himself by wavering on deals he had helped set in motion, not just on health care but also on issues like immigration. Mr. Schumer suggested that Mr. Trump caved to conservative opposition to the health care compromise.

“This president cannot govern if whenever the hard right frightens him and says, ‘Jump,’ he says, ‘How high?’” Mr. Schumer said.

Backers of the compromise face a tough task in selling the idea to many Republicans who would now be voting not to repeal the health care law, but to temporarily prop it up to avoid a breakdown in the marketplace. In addition, many on Capitol Hill say the compromise could be an important first step toward stabilizing the overall program, making future attempts to repeal it even more difficult.

Mr. Trump’s view will be crucial. His endorsement could provide important political cover for those nervous about voting to bolster the health care law while his opposition could cause Republicans to flee, fearing they will come under attack from the president and his allies.

Mr. Alexander is not retreating. Trying to build momentum, he and Ms. Murray introduced the legislation on Thursday along with two dozen leading Republican and Democratic co-sponsors — an almost unheard-of event on a major bill in this highly polarized environment.

Among Republicans backing the measure were Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, long active in health policy; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the authors of the most recent repeal plan; Bob Corker, Mr. Alexander’s Tennessee colleague who has been feuding with the president; and the group who thwarted Republican repeal efforts, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I don’t believe Congress will want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue,” Mr. Alexander said.

He and Ms. Murray said that they had built in protections to make sure the money went to consumers and that it was a mischaracterization to call it an industry bailout. They said both sides gave substantial ground in the talks. Ms. Murray told fellow Democrats this week that it was the toughest bargaining she had been involved in as a senator.

“It sends a powerful message that when members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done,” Ms. Murray said of the negotiation.

But to a large degree, the ultimate success of the talks depends on Mr. McConnell. He has been quiet so far about the bill and whether he would push it forward. The Senate would no doubt have to give it a strong vote for the plan to have any chance of moving through the House.

The support from a growing list of Republican co-sponsors is no guarantee that the Senate will consider the bill if Mr. McConnell views it as too politically risky. He refused to bring to the floor last year a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul that had broad support because of political considerations — despite the fact that Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, was a chief author.

The threat to democracy posed by the current outbreak of populist nationalism has become a matter of concern for both scholars and ordinary citizens. The central topic at a conference at Yale earlier this month was “How Do Democracies Fall Apart,” and the subject will be taken up again in November at a Stanford conference called “Global Populisms: A Threat to Democracy?”

I contacted several of the participants at the Yale gathering and was struck by their anxiety over the future prospects of democratic governance.

One of the most insightful was Adam Przeworski, a political scientist at N.Y.U., who has written, but not yet published, his own analysis of current events under the title “What’s Happening.”

First and foremost, Przeworski stresses,

there is nothing ""undemocratic"" about the electoral victory of Donald Trump or the rise of anti-establishment parties in Europe.

These parties and candidates, he points out:

Do not advocate replacing elections by some other way of selecting rulers. They are ugly — most people view racism and xenophobia as ugly — but these parties do campaign under the slogan of returning to ‘the people’ the power usurped by elites, which they see as strengthening democracy. In the words of a Trump advertisement, “Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people.”

In support of Przeworski’s argument, it is clear that the success of the Trump campaign in winning the Republican nomination was the result of a classic democratic insurgency: the Republican electorate’s rejection of its party’s establishment.

The danger in the United States, in Przeworski’s view, is the possibility that the Trump administration will use the power of the presidency to undermine the procedures and institutions essential to the operation of democracy:

That the incumbent administration would intimidate hostile media and create a propaganda machine of its own, that it would politicize the security agencies, that it would harass political opponents, that it would use state power to reward sympathetic private firms, that it would selectively enforce laws, that it would provoke foreign conflicts to monger fear, that it would rig elections.

Przeworski believes that

such a scenario would not be unprecedented. The United States has a long history of waves of political repression: the “Red Scare” of 1917-20, the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II, the McCarthy period, the Nixon presidency.

Along similar lines, Anna Grzymala-Busse, a political scientist at Stanford, replied by email to my inquiry:

My big worry is not simply that formal institutions have been eroded, but that the informal norms that underpin them are even more important and even more fragile. Norms of transparency, conflict of interest, civil discourse, respect for the opposition and freedom of the press, and equal treatment of citizens are all consistently undermined, and without these the formal institutions become brittle.

Trump, in Grzymala-Busse’s assessment, “articulates a classic populist message that we see in Europe: the elite establishment is a collusive cartel uninterested in the problems of ‘the people,’” and, she continued, he has begun to follow the path of European populist leaders:

Much of Trump’s language and actions are also familiar: there is a standard authoritarian populist template, developed in Hungary and faithfully followed in Poland and in Turkey: first, go after the courts, then the media, then the civil society, churches, universities.

The attacks on the courts, media and universities

are not simply the ravings of a lunatic, but an established strategy for undermining democratic oversight and discrediting the opposition.

Margaret Levi, another political scientist at Stanford, wrote me that she was

not sure Trumpism per se will survive Trump. But I do think it is the current embodiment of a right-wing populism that is likely to remain the basis of internal opposition within the Republican Party or be the basis of a split in the Party, leading to two new parties.

Some form of right-wing populism, Levi argued,

is already a competitive force in general elections. And it is once again a force in competitive elections in democracies world-wide.

She added that there was no guarantee that right-wing populism “will not transform into the fascist and Nazi forms.”

Unless the Democratic Party in this country and moderate parties in the rest of the world “find a way to address the populace’s underlying economic insecurity and deterioration in the perceived (and actual in many cases) standard of living, the possibility for irreparable damage does exist,” Levi wrote:

Otherwise, both confidence in democratic government, measured by the extent it is a reliable provider of needed goods and services, including domestic and international security, and its legitimacy, the normative belief in its right to rule, will decline significantly and dangerously — perhaps even to the point of no return.

While white identitarianism, anger over immigration and economic dislocation are often cited as causes of the emergence of right-wing populism, another argument is that there is a growing segment of the electorate that is alienated from cultural norms they see as imposed on them by a ruling elite — a repressive elite; politically correct and socially remote.

In a research paper published in the current issue of the Journal of Democracy, “Eroding Norms and Democratic Deconsolidation,” Paul Howe, a political scientist at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, describes the increasing size of the nihilistic segment of the American electorate.

This constituency of the disengaged and profoundly alienated provides a base of support in the United States and Europe for populist leaders who, in Howe’s view, fit the Trump mold:

They compete in the democratic process, yet with words and actions that convey disregard for core democratic principles such as the rule of law, minority rights, and checks and balances on executive power. At the same time, a number of these individuals are prone to brazen, dubious, and sometimes aggressive behaviors that suggest outsized egos, scant respect for others, and a degree of contempt for social norms.

Looking at data from World Values Surveys in recent decades, Howe finds that in the United States,

the rise of antidemocratic sentiment has less to do with dysfunction in the political arena than with corrosive changes that have reshaped the social and cultural landscape more generally.

These corrosive changes include an increase in the number of citizens who say it is O.K. to

claim government benefits to which one is not entitled; take a bribe in the course of one’s duties; cheat on taxes; and avoid a public-transit fare.

When answers to these questions were correlated with political attitudes, Howe found that

indifferent feelings toward democracy are interlaced with a broader set of self-interested and antisocial attitudes that are present among a substantial minority of the U.S. population.

He then argues that the

broader constellation of transgressive and antisocial attitudes among a subsection of the public is an important force behind rising disregard for democratic norms.

Clearly, a sense of isolation, actual isolation, the breakdown of the family, the rise of opiates, the disappearance of associations, a nation “bowling alone” and “coming apart,” have all played a role in creating an antisocial constituency. This very constituency has produced some of the strongest Trump supporters and backing for the so-called alt-right. As Howe writes:

Those with a high-school education or less are substantially more likely than those with a college degree to express skeptical views about democracy as well as tolerance of various antisocial behaviors, by variances that range from 5 to 30 percentage points across the questions.

Few people have looked at these issues as long and as hard as Ron Inglehart, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. In “The Danger of Deconsolidation: How Much Should We Worry?” (published alongside the Foa-Mounk essay in the July 2016 issue of the Journal of Democracy) Inglehart raises this question:

What makes the United States so distinctive? One reason may be that in recent years U.S. democracy has become appallingly dysfunctional. It suffers from 1) virtual paralysis at the top, as exemplified by the willingness of Congress to shut down the federal government, regardless of the damage to the country’s credit, after failing to get its way via normal procedures in a budget standoff with the White House; 2) massive increases in income inequality — greater than those found in any other established democracy, with most of the population’s real income declining during the past few decades despite substantial economic growth; and 3) the disproportionate and growing political influence of billionaires, as money plays a greater role in U.S. politics than in almost any other democracy.

The economic boom in the post-World War II years “produced rising security and an intergenerational shift toward self-expression values,” Inglehart wrote, but “in recent decades most advanced industrial societies have experienced economic stagnation, rising unemployment coupled with massive immigration, and the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.”

The resulting “high levels of existential insecurity,” Inglehart argues,

are conducive to authoritarianism, xenophobia, and rejection of new cultural norms. The economic stagnation and rising inequality of recent decades have led to increasing support for authoritarian, xenophobic political candidates, from Marine le Pen in France to Donald Trump in the United States.

While the contemporary explosion of right-wing populism is a recent phenomenon, its roots go deeper, best captured by Daniel Bell in his 1972 essay “The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism” which foreshadowed the Trump era.

American capitalism, Bell wrote,

has lost its traditional legitimacy which was based on a moral system of reward, rooted in a Protestant sanctification of work. It has substituted in its place a hedonism which promises a material ease and luxury, yet shies away from all the historic implications which a “voluptuary system” — and all its social permissiveness and libertinism — implies.

The conflict between “the principles of economics and economizing” and a culture “rooted in a return to instinctual modes” has produced a “disjunction which is the historic crisis of Western society. This cultural contradiction, in the long run, is the deepest challenge to the society.”

For the moment, the Republican Party has become the main battleground for the struggle over authoritarianism, xenophobia and the erosion of received standards.

At the Yale conference, Daniel Ziblatt, a professor of government at Harvard, warned that Trump and other right-wing leaders have breached traditional political boundaries that serve as “the soft guardrails of democracy.” The two “master norms,” in Ziblatt’s view, are mutual toleration, that is, the acceptance of “the basic legitimacy of our opponents,” and institutional forbearance — the responsible exercise of power by those in office.

Both his detractors and his supporters recognize that Trump has flouted countless rules — and revels in doing so. On Monday, Senator John McCain, awarded the Liberty Medal by the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, challenged Trump on this score:

To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain “the last best hope of earth” for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.

Mounk and Ziblatt, writing for Vox in March of 2016, made the case that “Trump isn’t a fascist; he’s a demagogue.” Their conclusion, however, was that Trump’s demagoguery does not make him any “less dangerous.” Instead, Trump and politicians like him are “a profound threat to the survival of democratic politics.”

Politicians in the Trump mold

wreck the informal rules of civility that democracies require to survive. Once voters are activated along violent lines and fervently believe the myths propagated by the demagogue, the dam is broken; the ordinary rules of democratic politics no longer apply, and there is no telling what might come next.

Timothy Snyder, a historian at Yale and the author of “Bloodlands” and “Black Earth” (and also a contributor to these pages) was a participant at the conference in New Haven. He introduces his most recent book, “On Tyranny,” this way:

The Founding Fathers tried to protect us from the threat they knew, the tyranny that overcame ancient democracy. Today, our political order faces new threats, not unlike the totalitarianism of the twentieth century. We are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so.

Writing in 2012, well before the advent of Trump, three economists, Luigi Guiso, Helios Herrera and Massimo Morelli, argued that the populist political tradition itself is based first on “promises of redistribution to the masses” and second on “concealment of government budget constraints from the voters.” Promising redistribution to the masses and concealing government budget constraints was the essence of Trump’s campaign strategy, as he promised to build a multibillion dollar wall “which Mexico will pay for”; to repeal Obamacare and replace it with “health care which will expand choice, increase access, lower costs & provide better care”; to preserve Medicare; and to enact a gigantic tax cut for the middle class. So far, Trump has failed to fulfill any of these promises, boxed in by the reality of “government budget constraints.”

Paul Waldman, writing in The Washington Post on Oct, 17, summed up Trump’s approach to veracity and to reality itself:

Trump takes his own particular combination of ignorance, bluster and malice, and sets it off like a nuclear bomb of misinformation. The fallout spreads throughout the country, and no volume of corrections and fact checks can stop it. It wasn’t even part of a thought-out strategy, just a loathsome impulse that found its way out of the president’s mouth to spread far and wide.

Trump’s recklessness is disturbing enough on its own. But what makes it especially threatening is that much of the public — well beyond the 40 percent of the electorate that has shown itself to be unshakable in its devotion to the president — seems to be slowly accommodating itself to its daily dose of the Trump reality show, accepting the rhetorical violence that Trump inflicts on basic standards of truth as the new normal.",Democracy Can Plant the Seeds of Its Own Destruction,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/democracy-populism-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

He jettisoned increased penalties for assault against utility workers and false advertising in pet sales.

He vetoed a campus sexual harassment bill that won large majorities in the statehouse, where Democrats dominate in both chambers.

“Depriving any student of higher education opportunities should not be done lightly,” Mr. Brown wrote in part, adding, “It is time to pause and survey the land.”

Thad Kousser, a political scientist at U.C. San Diego, said Mr. Brown essentially sees his role as steering California toward the political middle.

“This is a governor who relishes his role as the adult in the room,” Dr. Kousser said.

State lawmakers this year approved a measure directed at President Trump that would have compelled presidential candidates to release their tax returns, something Mr. Trump never did.

The governor rejected it.

“I recognize the political attractiveness — even the merits — of getting President Trump’s tax returns,” he wrote. But he worried, he added, about creating a “slippery slope.”

“Krazy” George Henderson is a conductor not of music but of the masses.

His big moment came 36 years ago in front of a packed Oakland Coliseum during a playoff game between the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees.

It was this week in 1981 that Mr. Henderson led a crowd in the first televised audience wave.

He had gotten into leading cheers in the 1960s as a student at San Jose State University, where he was a rabid fan of the Spartans.

The hobby turned into a career after professional teams around the Bay Area began hiring him to whip their fans into a frenzy. The tools of his trade: cut-off jeans shorts, wild blonde hair, a handheld drum and boundless energy.

By the time he unveiled the wave for a national television audience, he had been perfecting it for years in smaller venues. The announcers at the coliseum marveled as fans stood up in turns, waving their arms at Mr. Henderson’s direction.

“It’s amazing,” one said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Washington State fans claimed they had been doing a wave even earlier, but Mr. Henderson’s was the first to be seen by the world.

The wave became a staple of sporting events and Mr. Henderson’s cheerleading career spanned four decades.

Now 73, he lives with his wife in Capitola by Monterey Bay.

Reached by phone, he said he’s only semi-retired. A couple weeks ago he went to San Jose State to lead cheers for his Spartans — free of charge.

With the team down by several touchdowns, he led the half-filled stadium in a wave.

Constructor Notes

I’m 20 years old, a junior at Brandeis University, majoring in Chemistry and American Studies. I started writing crosswords my freshman year of college. My school newspaper, the Justice, was using some very underwhelming syndicated crosswords, and I said to myself, “I could write better crosswords than that!” I couldn’t. At least, not at first. I still shudder to think of some of my very early crosswords. But, as I got more and more practice, I started to get decent at it. I continue to write a crossword for them each week. But when I write what I think is a really good puzzle, I send it off to The Times instead. This time, it seems Will agreed with me, and I got in. Not without a number of revisions beforehand, though. It’s a real honor to be in The New York Times for the first time, and I hope it won’t be the last! As for this puzzle’s construction, I don’t have all that much to say about it. The idea had been rattling around in my brain for a while before I got around to making it. I ended up brainstorming by thinking of all the spatial words I could muster, seeing which ones had phrases associated with them, and then seeing what I could come up with for words that fit those phrases. BENEATH ME was by far the answer I was most pleased with. I really learned a lot from the revision process, but I know I’ve got a lot left to learn about making crosswords.

But here’s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.","Because today’s giants are nimbler and more paranoid about upstart competition than the tech behemoths of yore, they have cleverly created an ecosystem that enriches themselves even when they don’t think of the best ideas first. The Five run server clouds, app stores, ad networks and venture firms, altars to which the smaller guys must pay a sizable tax just for existing. For the Five, the start-up economy has turned into a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition — they love start-ups, but in the same way that orcas love baby seals.

There is perhaps no better example of this dynamic than what has happened to Snap, the company that makes the disappearing messaging app Snapchat. Although it is one of the most innovative consumer-focused internet companies — Snap created a whole new paradigm in social networking, and pioneered the idea that the camera is the future of human communication — it has been battered by the giants.

After failing to buy Snap several years ago, Facebook repeatedly tried to copy its key innovations. This year, when Facebook lifted Snapchat’s Stories feature for Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook’s main app, it seemed to deliver a death blow.

But Facebook isn’t the only behemoth trying to feed off Snap’s carcass. In January, Snap signed a cloud hosting deal with Google. It agreed to pay Google $400 million a year for the next five years. Note that Snap booked only about $330 million in ad revenue in the first half of this year. In other words, it’s paying more than half of its revenue to Google.

Oh, and do you know who its largest competitors in the internet ad market are? Surprise! Facebook and Google.

The small guys won’t concede any this, of course. Unbridled optimism fuels start-up world, and many investors and start-up executives I talked to in recent weeks argued that with the insane amounts of money pouring into start-ups, the Five don’t have the whole game won.

They said the Five’s platforms had made starting companies cheaper and easier, and pointed to several successful start-ups that managed to elude the Five’s clutches in the last few years: Netflix, Uber and Airbnb. And when you look at business-focused companies that aren’t household names, you come up with dozens more, from Slack to Stripe to Square.

“In a lot of ways I’d say it hasn’t changed,” said Joey Levin, the chief executive of IAC, an internet and media company based in New York. “I’ve been around the internet long enough, and the first thing we used to ask in every meeting when I started was, ‘Why won’t Microsoft do your business?’ Then six years later it was, ‘Why doesn’t Google do it?’ Now it’s a combination of why can’t Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon do this?”

Mr. Levin’s position is interesting. Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller’s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.

Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day’s tech giants. In many cases, though, IAC made money by shrewdly navigating the giants. Sometimes it worked with the behemoths, other times it competed with them, and always it looked for opportunities above and beneath and between the giants, like a clever pigeon picking up crumbs around a picnic table.

IAC’s latest gambit is Angi Homeservices, a company that combines two big brands aimed at home repair and refurbishing, Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor. That company competes directly with some of the Five — both Google and Amazon have services meant to help you find people to install things your house.

Chris Terrill, the chief executive, told me that Angi Homeservices had a dedicated team working on providing a service that’s superior to anything the giants can build. But he also said his company was eager to team up with one of the big guys — for instance, on one of their voice-assistant platforms — because working with one of the Five could ease its path into the big leagues.

“We think that a smart voice provider will say, ‘If I want to win at all costs, we’ll go get the very best partner’ — and that’s us,” Mr. Terrill said.

In some ways, IAC could be a model for the internet company of tomorrow. It clearly aims big and isn’t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet. It’s not betting on their demise; rather, it’s betting on their continued success. If Angi is to win, so will one or more of the Five.

IAC’s executives recognize the danger of a digital marketplace that is so heavily dependent on big guys. “I think the opportunities are still there, but I do worry that some of the biggest players are going to stifle that competition by trying to do and own too much themselves,” Mr. Terrill said.

I asked another IAC veteran, Dara Khosrowshahi — who until recently was the chief executive of Expedia — whether he believed the internet was still an open field for innovation, or whether the Five were closing it off.

“I’m mixed as it relates to that,” he said. “I fundamentally think innovative ideas can still survive and thrive, but the Googles and Facebooks of the world have so much more intelligence as to mass consumer behavior that they probably have an unfair advantage in identifying these early fast movers — and are willing to pay prices that are extraordinary for them.”

In August, Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed chief executive of Uber, where he will have to deal with the giants more directly. Though his company is the most highly valued start-up of our age, its success seems far from assured. Many of its problems are of its own making, and Mr. Khosrowshahi is determined to fix them.

But like Snap, Uber is at the mercy of the Five. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is an investor in Uber. But Alphabet’s autonomous-car company, Waymo, is also a competitor to Uber. On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.

The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy. But here’s one thing that seems a sure bet: Whether Uber wins or loses, Google will end up doing just fine.",How the Frightful Five Put Start-Ups in a Lose-Lose Situation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/technology/frightful-five-start-ups.html

Yet, despite the good motives, myRA was a tiny tinker when large-scale change is demanded, a government-run program instead of a market-based response, and a dramatic waste of taxpayer dollars. Because it was managed by the Treasury Department and only invested in government securities, the private sector was kept off the playing field. As opposed to individual retirement accounts, there was no flood of financial industry TV commercials trying to persuade Americans to open a myRA.

Running the entire program through the federal government, the Obama administration spent $70 million and only got 20,000 Americans to invest — an outrageous cost of $3,500 for each new account. Of that, $10 million went to a single bank — Comerica — to act as custodian for this small number of simple, non-trading accounts.

Inheriting this debacle, the Trump administration could have reformed this program. Or it could have replaced it. Instead, it repealed it without anything to take its place. The cabinet is stacked with millionaires while Americans sitting on the sidelines of asset building are being told they are on their own.

When it comes to the crisis of retirement security and asset building, the financial industry has been either callous in a focus on serving only the very wealthy or rapacious as it saddles everyday investors with high fees. The federal government has oscillated between incompetence and indifference; between being softheaded or hardhearted. And the plight of the hundreds of millions of Americans continues as they watch inequality grow and their financial security wither.

It was not always this way. Just 10 years ago, a bipartisan collection of senators — Jeff Sessions, Jim DeMint and Rick Santorum on one side of the aisle and Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer on the other — came together to support legislation to give newborn Americans a $500 “baby bond” that would grow over time. Amid the tumult of the Great Recession, this idea of a “nest egg in every crib” went the way of the Republicans’ promise in 1928 to put “a chicken in every pot” during the Great Depression.

Perhaps in a Washington struggling to find a way to make tax reform bold and bipartisan, this idea may yet have new lease on life. Whether it is policy or private sector innovation, an alternative to the status quo in Washington and on Wall Street is the only way to bridge the growing gap between a surging investing class and vast majority of Americans falling ever further behind.",The Sad Tale of the MyRA,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/the-sad-tale-of-the-myra.html

Categorizing Pallbearer as prog-rock makes its commercial situation slightly less novel, and is appropriate to its ambitious compositions. (As the critic Michael Nelson has noted, many of its songs manage to be catchy without having choruses.) But no matter where you file its records, Pallbearer still honors doom’s prime directive: Make it heavy. When I asked a friend who studied music theory to explain why certain moments on “Heartless” sounded so powerful, his answer included “DRAMA,” “churchy,” “gravy,” “LOW” and “sweet, thick feeling.”

The guitarists Devin Holt and Brett Campbell play in drop-A tuning, which means fifths and octaves ringing in low registers. Their fastest songs still feel burdened. Though the classic pop chords at the end of “An Offering of Grief” are uplifting, the fact that C, G, F and the gang are slowly crashing down at 64 b.p.m. means you’ll probably never hear them in a Toyota commercial, unless Toyota starts selling cement mixers. Like all those records I played at the wrong speed, Pallbearer’s leave space to soak in each chord, even if you can’t see to the bottom.

At its best, Pallbearer’s infusion of fresh harmonic blood into doom’s turgid circulatory system is exhilarating. The emotional power of a pivot to a B-flat major chord during “Lie of Survival” kept surprising me, until I realized it reminded me of one of my favorite moments in sacred music: the climactic hallelujahs in Edward Bairstow’s 1925 setting of “Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence.” Indeed, when I saw Pallbearer perform in the spring, I was struck by the sight of headbangers with eyes closed and arms upraised, swaying like megachurch attendees coming down with the holy spirit. And as the band pounded through the wordless opening of “A Plea for Understanding,” a chord progression of punishing melancholy that seems sweetly protective of its A-major home, I realized I was on the verge of tears.

Granted, it had been an exhausting few months. I had already fallen into the unhealthful habits of mistaking my dread for integrity and of confusing skimming the news all day with civic engagement. At that concert, Pallbearer’s despairing optimism and go-for-broke sincerity felt like a moral rebuke to the doom I’d grown too comfortable with. As the crowd threw its fists in the air, as the band continued pummeling away at one of the most resonant emotional campaigns in American rock music, as our horizons expanded, I was happy to be recruited — to believe, finally, in the audacity of doom.",Letter of Recommendation: Pallbearer,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-pallbearer.html

Supreme Court justices have a tough job. They are required to hand down decisions that can affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars. And while some of the issues before them are purely legal, many turn on complex policy questions: Do black voters in the South still face substantial discrimination? How reliable are eyewitnesses? Are people convicted of sex offenses very likely to reoffend?

These questions can be answered only by understanding what the data says. Unfortunately, a report released by ProPublica on Tuesday suggests that the justices struggle with that task. Looking at a random sample of cases from 2011 to 2015, ProPublica found that the court cited faulty research or introduced its own errors in nearly a third of the 24 cases that relied on such facts.

In 2013, for example, Shelby County v. Holder invalidated a critical portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, making it arguably one of the most consequential cases in recent years. Justice John G. Roberts Jr., arguing that the South had taken great strides that made the protections of the act unnecessary, based his decision in part on a Senate Judiciary Committee analysis that misinterpreted how the Census Bureau reports race and ethnicity data and wrongly suggested that registration gaps between minorities and whites had shrunk significantly, an error that neither he nor his clerks caught.

As ProPublica itself acknowledges, its sample is too small to draw any solid statistical inferences, but the results are still troubling. They are also not particularly surprising. None of the justices has any serious training in statistics, and the clerks who assist them are almost all recent law school graduates, who rarely have any formal statistical background. Empirical facts are central to what the court does, but its members lack expertise.

Sometimes justices seem almost amused by that lack.

But the beachwear and fat arms hand-typed letter stood out. I googled the return address and found a satellite street image of an ugly red pickup truck parked in a nondescript yard, which told me, well, nothing actually.

I love my beachwear — these cute completely insubstantial crocheted cover-ups that come to the elbows.

Apparently I was damned if I did and damned if I didn’t.

How had Mr. or Mrs. Red Pickup Truck deduced that? After parading the letter around the office in a futile search for reassurance from my guffawing colleagues — do men get such missives? — I took to social media where my Facebook friends were bound to do a better job of buoying me up.

Over the past months, looking for people (other than myself for eating too many bowls of Jollof rice) to blame for the letter, I’ve settled on the city of Washington D.C., where I live and work.

The city is too conservative for my haphazard style. Go to Capitol Hill and it’s a sea of Ann Taylor low-heeled pumps and Talbot’s suits.

In recent years, Washington has played host to two First Ladies — Michelle Obama and now Melania Trump — who have pushed the envelope of what women wear here. But remember the stir when Mrs. Obama bared her arms in her first official photo as First Lady? Or the recent social media storm when Mrs. Trump wore stilettos to a hurricane?

Clearly, I’ve decided, Washington can’t handle too much fashion forwardness. A couple of years ago, I tried on a pair of gorgeous deep red laced-up ankle boots in Paris, and the guy at the cash register stopped me as I was handing him my credit card.

“You live in Washington? You will wear these there?” he said, causing me to pause.

I sighed. “Okay, give me the black pair.” I feel bitter about it every time I put on those black boots.

A few years ago, a friend who is a CNN correspondent gave me a pair of sedate post earrings for Christmas. I had just told her about some blog post that had me in high dudgeon, in which evil bloggers had critiqued the earrings I wore one night on the PBS show “Washington Week.” “There were three tiers to those earrings,” they snarked. “Exactly who costumed Helene? And if this passes for professional dress at The Times these days, color us shocked.”

My friend and I laughed about it, although I was secretly mad, and she sent me a pair of earrings that didn’t dangle to wear next time I went on TV. I promised her I would wear them.

But of course I didn’t.

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

WASHINGTON — Let’s just get this out of the way: There are other matters of consequence going on in the world.

But in these fractious times, a series of puppy photos sent by none other than the fun-loving scamps at the Central Intelligence Agency qualifies as a feel-good, stick-it-to-the-man moment, shared by thousands of people who are marooned in office jobs. Meet Lulu, the black Labrador retriever and free spirit who bucked expectations and flunked out of the C.I.A.’s explosive detection “puppy class.”

Maybe it was her shiny coat that made Lulu’s story ricochet around the internet. Maybe it was her soft brown eyes. Or maybe her story just sounds familiar to any American who has experienced workplace ennui: She underwent rigorous training for a daily grind job and decided that sniffing out bombs was not her calling. (And who actually wants that job, anyway?)

Then consider the most glaring truth: Whatever Stalin perfected was rooted in the Leninist system.
“From his first few hours as leader of Russia, he laid the ground for rule by terror,” Sebestyen writes.
… Not for nothing did Stalin call himself Lenin’s disciple.” But why blame only Lenin and Stalin?
If you believe in me, you will gain salvation — not in the Great Beyond, but in the Here and Now.","All of Leninism may be reduced to two famous words uttered by the Founder in 1921 and repeated by Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin: “Kto kovo?” “Who, whom?” That is, who will do in whom? A comrade-turned-foe gave Lenin something of a pass by invoking tragedy. Lenin “desired the good … but created evil.” Sebestyen seems to agree: The “worst of his evils was to have left a man like Stalin in a position to lead Russia after him. That was a historic crime.”

This sounds a familiar note: Lenin was history’s agent of necessity and justice, bringing down a decrepit czarist regime that had enslaved an entire nation. Yet his heir, Stalin, was evil incarnate, sending millions to the gulag or murdering them outright. Robert Conquest, the cleareyed historian of the Soviet Union who wrote “The Great Terror,” the definitive work on Stalin’s purges, quipped in a limerick: “There was a great Marxist named Lenin / Who did two or three million men in. / That’s a lot to have done in / But where he did one in / That grand Marxist Stalin did 10 in.”

To be fair, Sebestyen doesn’t fall for those exculpatory tales spun by so many Westerners to wrest “good” Marxism from Stalin’s butchering hands. And neither did Conquest. Yes, Stalin “did in” 10 times more than the First Bolshevik. But factor in time. Lenin had only seven years in power while Stalin had 30. Then consider the most glaring truth: Whatever Stalin perfected was rooted in the Leninist system.

It was Lenin who created the “basis for a one-man tyranny,” the Polish scholar Leszek Kolakowski notes in his magisterial “Main Currents of Marxism.” “We do not promise any freedom, or any democracy,” Lenin exclaimed at the Third Congress of the Comintern in 1921. “We were never concerned with the Kantian-priestly and vegetarian-Quaker prattle about the sacredness of human life,” his comrade Trotsky declared in “The Defense of Terrorism.” As Kolakowski put it tout court: Like Lenin, Stalin “was the personification of a system which irresistibly sought to be personified.”

Where the system was heading, shattering all “hopes and dreams for freedom under the revolution,” became cruelly obvious as early as 1921, when sailors revolted at the Kronstadt naval base. At first, they clamored for larger rations, echoing the mutiny of 1905 — the original Russian revolution — immortalized in Eisenstein’s “Battleship Potemkin.” Then it escalated, though peacefully. A mass meeting drew up a list of political demands: free elections, free trade unions, a free press and the abolition of the Cheka, the secret police that had taken over from the czar’s Okhrana.

“They must be shown no mercy,” Lenin thundered. He dispatched 20,000 troops under the command of Trotsky, who unleashed an “inferno,” according to Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who would rise to Marshall of the Soviet Union. Sebestyen rightly depicts the massacre as a turning point. “After the savagery … few people would be under any illusions that Lenin would brook serious opposition.”

The terror was systemic, not Stalin’s creation. As Dostoyevsky observed in “The House of the Dead,” “Tyranny is a habit. It has its own organic life; it develops finally into a disease. … Blood and power intoxicate.” Maxim Gorky, an early supporter who would soon call Lenin a “coldblooded trickster,” concurred: Former slaves “will become unbridled despots as soon as they have the chance.” So radicalization was not a matter of personality, but destiny.

Lenin used his chance well. “From his first few hours as leader of Russia, he laid the ground for rule by terror,” Sebestyen writes. On the second day, he began to censor the press. On Dec. 7, 1917, he set up the Cheka to combat “counterrevolution, speculation and sabotage.” He abolished the legal system in favor of “revolutionary justice,” which legitimized every perversion of the law. “To us,” Lenin pontificated, “all is permitted. … Blood? Let there be blood.” For victory was not possible “without the very cruelest revolutionary terror.”

The scholar Robert Service puts it all in a nutshell in his acclaimed book “A History of Modern Russia”: “The forced-labor camps, the one-party state … the prohibition of free and popular elections, the ban on internal party dissent: not one of them had to be invented by Stalin. … Not for nothing did Stalin call himself Lenin’s disciple.” But why blame only Lenin and Stalin? As Sebestyen emphasizes: “The structure of the police state had been established under Nicholas I in the 1820s.”

The difference between czarism and Leninism is the one between absolutism and totalitarianism. It is one-man rule in both systems, but the critical ingredient is the total state — what the Nazis imposed as Gleichschaltung — the liquidation of civil society top to bottom: parties, unions, media, churches, guilds and associations.

Lenin’s most brilliant invention was a secular religion: Communism. If you believe in me, you will gain salvation — not in the Great Beyond, but in the Here and Now. And if you don’t believe, the revolutionary faith pronounced, we will kill you. With this brand-new choice — paradise on earth or speedy demise — the “obstinate little man” made a revolution that shook the world and inspired tyrants round the globe.

Though dead for more than 90 years, Lenin lives on in his mausoleum and in the minds of millions of Russians who have stood in line to commune with a corpse. Today, as Sebestyen writes in his concluding words, Lenin is being “used by a new breed of autocrats, extreme nationalists who may have dispensed with Communism but nevertheless respect Lenin as a strongman in the Russian tradition.” Lenin is dead; Leninism lives.",The First Totalitarian,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/books/review/victor-sebestyen-lenin-biography.html

Clearly, this kind of investing is not for everyone. No investment is a sure thing, but investing precious retirement money in neighborhood businesses, or a pal’s peanut farms, comes with risks far beyond the usual volatility in the stock market. You could lose it all — and lose a friend in the process.

In September 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a fraud alert on self-directed I.R.A.s. Among the commission’s concerns: it is easy to exploit self-directed I.R.A.s. Since the investments aren’t publicly traded, it can be harder to get the information needed to make smart investing decisions, raising the chances of fraud.

“Every investment has different risks,” said Kirk Chisholm, a wealth manager in Lexington, Mass. “The obvious risk is making a bad investment,” he said. After all, that’s the whole point of investing for retirement — to build a nest egg. “If you’re doing it just to help someone out, that’s not a good investment. You want to make sure it makes your retirement money grow, or why invest at all?”

He also suggests people invest in areas in which they have some expertise rather than operating blindly, even if they have the desire to do something good for another person or the community.

“You can be well intentioned and still be misguided,” said Nevin Adams, chief content officer at the American Retirement Association, a nonprofit member organization in Arlington, Va. “But the reality is, this is your I.R.A.; the reason it has protections is because it’s something you are investing for retirement. It might be a good cause, but it might not be good for your retirement.”

Mr. Brown — the man who invested in his friend’s child-care building — has a big advantage in this dangerous game: Because he is a tax lawyer by profession he is well aware of the potential risks and how to avoid them.

In his case, he structured a lease and option to buy back that would provide him with a fixed 10 percent annual return, regardless of how long he owned the real estate and when his friends exercised the option. He is aware that commercial real estate investors normally expect a greater return (rent plus appreciation), he said. But “I didn’t feel right doing it in the manner most real estate investors would do it, in light of my relationship with this friend.”

“The option was structured at a price equal to my purchase price, with a portion of their rent payments being credited against the purchase price if and when they exercised the option,” he said. That structure gave his friends an incentive to exercise the option as soon as they could, while still giving Mr. Brown the 10 percent annual return he was seeking.

“It also worked so that I did not feel I was gouging them, while still protecting my retirement-plan assets,” Mr. Brown said.","Should You Invest Your I.R.A. in Friends, Family or Charitable Work?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/invest-ira.html

So for the new study, which was published last month in Annals of Neurology, scientists at Orebro University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and other institutions decided to look at the medical histories of every person in Sweden who had been given a multiple sclerosis diagnosis since 1964, when the diagnosis began to be reported to a national medical database.

They found 7,292 men and women who had been given M.S. diagnoses through the end of 2012.

Then, to provide a contrasting cross-section of these patients’ peers, they matched each of those with M.S. with 10 other Swedes who shared their age, gender and county of residence, pulling this data from another database about every Swedish citizen. In total, the scientists analyzed data involving more than 80,000 people.

Finally, the researchers looked into whether any of these people had visited a Swedish hospital for treatment of a concussion or broken bone when they were young. (The Swedes keep extensive health databases.)

The researchers included the information about broken bones because the symptoms of M.S. often begin to affect people years before a diagnosis and can include clumsiness and falls. If people had stumbled and incurred head injuries because they had early M.S., then their disease might be contributing to their concussions and not the other way around, a statistical issue known as reverse causation.

In that case, however, people with M.S. should also have a high incidence of broken bones because of their falls. So the researchers looked at a range of bone injuries as a way to assess the likelihood that reverse causation might be responsible for their injuries.

They also homed in on concussions that occurred when the people in the study were young, dividing that time frame into concussions among children younger than 11, and adolescents between ages 11 and 20.

Then they analyzed the numbers. The results were concerning. Adolescents who had experienced one concussion were about 22 percent more likely to later develop M.S. than those who had not had such head trauma. The risk rose by about 150 percent if a young person had sustained multiple concussions.

Interestingly, concussions experienced during childhood did not contribute to a greater risk of M.S. later.

The findings suggest that “there could be a link” between head injury during adolescence and the development of M.S. as an adult, says Scott Montgomery, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Orebro University, who led the study.

Adolescent brains seem to be less physiologically resilient than those in younger children, he adds, making them potentially more vulnerable to long-term consequences from concussions than children. The youngsters also might have experienced milder concussions, since they are smaller and would likely hit with less impact.

Still, the absolute incidence of M.S. among young people in the study who had had a concussion remained small, Dr. Montgomery says, and many of those who had been injured in adolescence never developed the disease. It is probable, he says, that other factors are involved, including an underlying genetic susceptibility to the condition that, in some young people, might be awakened by a blow to the head.

The study also was observational, meaning that it can link concussions in youth to a greater risk for M.S., but not prove that one causes the other.

The findings remain important and cautionary, however.

“Physical activity and participation in sports should be encouraged in young people,” Dr. Montgomery says. “But we should try to minimize the risk of young people experiencing head injuries.”

And for those who might have had a concussion or three during youth, “talk with your doctor,” Dr. Montgomery says, “especially if you are experiencing any symptoms” of M.S., such as double vision, dizziness or balance problems. These conditions do not necessarily indicate a developing problem, he says, but should be assessed.",Concussions in Teenagers Tied to Multiple Sclerosis Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/well/move/concussions-in-teenagers-tied-to-multiple-sclerosis-risk.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Her starting point was her favorite artist: Aretha Franklin. She and Mr. Kallman, who was an executive producer of “Meaning of Life” with Ms. Clarkson, asked, “What if Aretha was born now and made a record today?”

They didn’t want the album to sound old. “So it’s just not nostalgic, it’s not a retro experience,” Mr. Kallman said in a phone interview, “but it’s really a modern experience infused with the best of those records we call standards.”

Ms. Clarkson teamed with familiar faces including Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Maureen “Mozella” McDonald (Miley Cyrus), as well as newcomers Jessica Ashley Karpov (Britney Spears) and the duo Nova Wav (Kehlani), in search of songs that capture her current state of mind: dealing with the rewards and complications that come with connecting with someone “emotionally, mentally, physically” in a marriage; and as a mature woman feeling completely comfortable in her own skin after years of withering, sexist criticism about her appearance. The results are sassy up-tempo numbers like “Heat” and “Didn’t I,” and slinky slow-jams like “Move You.”

“Obviously when you’re writing in your 20s — I’m not demeaning it, in any way — but it’s a different, juvenile kind of approach,” Ms. Clarkson said. Referring to an intimate ballad about foreplay, she added, “If I had sung ‘Slow Dance’ at 20, what the hell do I know about that?”

Jesse Shatkin, a producer and songwriter who worked with Sia on “Chandelier,” collaborated on half of the songs on “Meaning of Life,” including “Love So Soft.” He said Ms. Clarkson delighted in having her backup singers in the studio, filling the room with a gleeful feminine energy. “There was this really fun women-singing-all-over-the-studio, laughing-so-much, joking-all-the-time vibe,” he said.

But so far, “Love So Soft” has yet to rise past No. 62 on the Billboard Hot 100 after five weeks. Ms. Greenwald said that the first-week streaming numbers for the single indicated the listenership was over 50 percent male. “I would have bet you a million dollars it was going to be 85 percent women,” she said. “I was blown away.”

Sharon Dastur, a senior vice president at the radio company iHeartMedia, said Ms. Clarkson’s music has always been playable on multiple formats. “Is it still pop music? Absolutely,” she said in a phone interview, noting that the song is performing on both pop and Hot AC (adult contemporary) stations. Ms. Dastur, who attended Ms. Clarkson’s premiere event, said she’s been following her career from its start.

“I’ve never seen her so fully happy with herself, personally, professionally, her music,” she said. “I think people have always not only just loved her voice, her music, but her. I think that goes a long way with fans, that she’s been the same genuine, super-talented person she’s been from the beginning.”

MS. CLARKSON IS so disarming that when she returned from a bathroom break proclaiming, “Wow, I really had to pee! That was a lot!,” I nearly high-fived her. She calls herself “a tool” and “a nerd.” She loves “Game of Thrones,” but has never watched a reality show (and yes, she gets the irony). When she wants to be sure you catch her disdain, she quickly says “sarcasm, sarcasm.” On Twitter, she alternates between posting goofy GIFs, relentlessly positive shout-outs to artists she loves and rebukes to people who scold her for speaking out about issues like the violence in Charlottesville, Va., and N.F.L. players protesting. (She announced her support for Hillary Clinton in January 2016, and tweeted “Yaaaasssss!” upon learning that Mrs. Clinton cited her — and Nietzsche — in her book “What Happened.”)

She understands why fans feel an extra sense of ownership over her. We witnessed her “Idol” journey in real time. We heard the personal stories she shared in songs like “Because of You” and “Piece by Piece,” which describe feeling abandoned by her father following her parents’ divorce. We’ve seen her transparency and graciousness in an ecosystem that encourages the opposite.

“I actually don’t mind that,” she said, “because I feel a certain level of pride that people even feel like my journey is that important in their life. That’s cool, for someone from Nowhereville. I just mind when people all of a sudden feel like I’m one thing.”

Over the summer, Ms. Clarkson shined a light on the routine harassment women endure online by responding to a “You’re fat” tweet with “...and still [expletive] awesome.” (She added a winking-tongue-out emoji, perhaps because, as a therapist told her during one of the two sessions she’s ever had, “You don’t want to wreck someone’s day.”) And she has no patience for being instructed to “shut up and sing.”

“It’s weird, but I actually came with a brain, not just vocal cords, and it would be silly to not have an opinion,” she said, growing heated. “It would be a disgrace if I didn’t have an opinion. It would be a cruel irony to all these people who live in different countries who don’t have an opinion, and don’t count, for me not to take full advantage of all the opportunities that are laid before us here in this nation.”

The centerpiece of “Meaning of Life” is a feisty throwdown called “Whole Lotta Woman,” which alludes to the size of her waistline, her attitude, her self-worth and her mouth using references to Southern cooking. Ms. Clarkson said its inspiration came from the challenges of being a financially secure woman looking for a man after internalizing the paradoxes of growing up in the South, where women are told, “We want to educate you and we want you to be intelligent, but not too intelligent to where you’re intimidating; we want you to be beautiful, but not too sexy to where you’re a slut; we want you to be successful but not so successful that you make someone feel uncomfortable.”

Debuting the track for the radio promoters at her home, Ms. Clarkson couldn’t hold back. She sung along and bounced to its outro’s bass-heavy groove.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

Probably not good for your marriage, Mr. Chen. Or your life.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one. The members of an upstanding, upper-middle-class nuclear family are terrorized by a malign force. Their suffering is not entirely arbitrary, because not all of them are completely innocent. (Usually it’s Daddy’s fault.) Their tormentor metes out a cruel and disproportionate kind of justice, and revels in the punishment. Meanwhile, the audience squirms in complicity, taking both masochistic and sadistic pleasure at a game of cat and mouse in which the roles keep shifting.

I’ll stop now. It isn’t quite fair to say, with respect to Yorgos Lanthimos’s “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” that you’ve seen it all before. His methods and sensibility are very much his own. But if you were intrigued, unnerved and tickled by “The Lobster” or by Mr. Lanthimos’s earlier films “Alps” and “Dogtooth” (I was), you might be surprised and a little disappointed to find him traipsing over such familiar territory. His previous work — allegorical, satirical, anti-realist and metapsychological — defies genre labels and can seem scrubbed clean of any trace of influence. “Sacred Deer,” in contrast, rings all kinds of frequently-heard bells.

Video

The premise might remind you of any version of “Cape Fear” (except maybe the one from “The Simpsons”) or countless horror movies. Mr. Lanthimos’s techniques — a hovering, prying camera, an atmosphere of chilly, cerebral detachment — owe a debt to the films of Michael Haneke, in particular those like “Cache” and “Funny Games” that subject the guilty conscience of the bourgeoisie to painful deep-tissue massage. But Mr. Lanthimos is less interested in moral shock therapy or social criticism than in aesthetic estrangement. “Sacred Deer” feels like a dark, opaque bit of folklore transplanted into an off-kilter modern setting.

Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a respected heart surgeon. His wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman), is an equally successful eye doctor. They live with their two children — Kim (Raffey Cassidy), a wide-eyed teenage girl, and her younger brother, Bob (Sunny Suljic) — in a big house in an unspecified, apparently American city. (The film was shot in Ireland and Cincinnati.) Steven also has a curious friendship with an odd, earnest young man named Martin (Barry Keoghan). The two of them have lunch and take walks together and exchange gifts, and the opening scenes invite the audience to guess at the nature of their relationship.

It’s made clear soon enough. Martin, who seems both a little slow and spookily intuitive, turns out to be the evil force who will torment the Murphys. Some years earlier, Steven had performed an operation on the boy’s father, who subsequently died. In lieu of filing a malpractice claim, Martin has chosen a more archaic — and, in the film’s modern setting, a far scarier and more preposterous — form of score settling. He demands that Steven kill Anna or one of their kids. If he doesn’t, the whole family will sicken and die. Martin describes the process in exacting detail, and then it begins.

Is this a curse? A superpower? As in Mr. Lanthimos’s other movies, no explanation is offered. No boundary is marked between the normal and the supernatural. The normal, in this filmmaker’s world, is pretty weird to begin with. All the characters speak in the same droning, matter-of-fact tone until they are provoked to violent rage. They ask puzzling questions and produce overelaborate answers, not so much like machines but like people doing their best to fail a Turing test.

Sometimes this is funny, and sometimes effectively scary. The auditory migraine of the sound design and the visual paranoia of the drone-mounted cameras help create an ambience of perpetual panic. You laugh to break the tension, and also you can’t help but intuit a comic intention under the cast’s deadpan.

9 Ways to Help You Become a Smarter Investor Image Credit Zach Meyer

Figuring out what is going on in financial markets isn’t easy, even for professionals who trade constantly. In fact, for many people, forgetting about day-to-day market swings and taking a long-term perspective may be the best approach.

Yet anyone saving for retirement or a house, a car or an education — or trying to amass a nest egg for any reason at all — needs to periodically check in to see where the financial world is heading.

The last several months have been particularly puzzling. Markets have continued to rise, despite geopolitical turmoil that might have set them back. To help you understand what’s happening and what to do, w e’ve pulled together some of the biggest issues in investing in a quarterly report.

Among the nine articles are analyses and explanations that provide an easy-to-understand introduction to investing (and perhaps amuse you along the way).

The Stock Market Charges Ahead, Despite the World’s Storms

Wall Street has responded to political turmoil and natural disasters with barely a shrug. The markets have been charging ahead, not just in the past several months but over the past eight years. Stock prices have risen and there are far fewer — if any — bargains, compared with the days right after the end of the financial crisis in 2009.

All of which raises a big question: What are the prospects for a continuing bull market — or a major decline?

Focused Bets on Growth Propel Three Stock Funds

Many funds try simply to match the performance of the stock market. But three funds did better than that by taking a narrow approach.

They crimped the number of their holdings and made concentrated investments in hopes of increasing their total returns. It worked for them in the third quarter.

As Investors Turn to Bonds From Emerging Markets Like Brazil or India, How High Is the Risk?

With low interest rates in the United States and Europe, it has been tough to generate substantial income from bonds. There has been a big exception, though: bonds issued in emerging market countries.

Many of these fixed-income instruments have excelled in recent months, and managers of funds that specialize in them say such bonds continue to be attractive. But investing in them entails some complicated risks.

An Old-School Investment Manager That Builds Wealth Quietly

Because of their low cost and market-matching abilities, index funds have been growing rapidly in popularity. But there is a case to be made for old-fashioned, disciplined stock picking, especially when it is done at minimal expense.

One of the most successful old school stock picking outfits is Dodge & Cox, which does not advertise or promote its funds. It has a solid performance record and charges some of the lowest fees in the industry.

The High Cost of Not Talking About Money

Money won’t buy happiness, but it can help. This is no mystery. Acquiring, accumulating and spending money often seem to be universal preoccupations in the modern world.

Yet despite the evident importance of money, conversations about it can be very uncomfortable on a personal level. Is an inability to talk openly and honestly about money and investments hurting you in the wallet? A new book argues that it is.

How Funds Manage Boatloads of Money

When funds attract heaps of fresh money, it can be a great thing for investors. A surge in new assets can create economies of scale that are passed along to shareholders, reducing costs and improving performance.

But that virtuous cycle doesn’t always happen. It is worth examining whether sudden inflows of cash have led to poor decisions by fund managers, hurting investor returns.

Where Do All the Disgraced C.E.O.s Go?

Richard F. Smith left Equifax in September after the company came under fire for a cybersecurity breach that compromised the personal information of potentially millions of consumers. Mike Cagney left Social Finance, the student loan company he had co-founded, after reports of allegations of sexual harassment and the company’s “frat house” culture. And then there is the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein , who was fired by his own company after years of allegations of sexual harassment and payoffs to accusers.

Chief executives seem to be stepping down from their posts — voluntarily or not — every day. Where do they go after they leave a scandal-ridden company? Here are some whimsical thoughts on a suitable destination for the besmirched.

Investing by Betting on the Sponsors of Sports

Invest in what you know: That’s an old mantra, and it makes a lot of sense. But what if what you know is, basically, sports?

If you’re not a billionaire and can’t buy teams or leagues outright, it will be difficult to invest in them directly: Most teams and leagues aren’t publicly traded.

So a sportscaster and a financial planner have started a new fund that enables avid fans to place indirect bets. This exchange-traded fund tracks companies that sponsor sports teams or broadcasters. The fund may be a comforting place for sports lovers to place their money, but buyer beware. It is largely untested.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

That has completely changed. Today, 75 percent of people with opioid addictions began with prescription painkillers. The slide starts not on a street corner, but in a doctor’s office.

That’s because pharmaceutical companies in the 1990s sought to promote opioid painkillers as new blockbuster drugs. Company executives accused doctors of often undertreating pain (there was something to this, but pharma executives contrived to turn it into a crisis that they could monetize). The companies backed front organizations like the American Pain Foundation, which purported to speak on behalf of suffering patients.

These front organizations, as well as professionals sometimes funded by the pharmaceutical industry, heralded pain as the “fifth vital sign,” along with pulse, temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure. The opioid promoters hailed opioids as “safe and effective,” and they particularly encouraged opioids for returning veterans — one reason so many veterans have suffered addictions.

Pharma companies spent heavily advertising opioids — $14 million in medical journals in 2011 alone, almost triple what they had spent in 2001 and pitched them for a wide range of chronic pains, such as arthritis and back pain.

Companies even argued that signs of addiction were a reason to prescribe more opioids. Endo Pharmaceuticals distributed a book suggesting that when a patient showed strange behavior, “the clinician’s first response” should be to increase the dose of opioids.

Several of these examples come from a lawsuit by Ohio against major pharmaceutical companies, including Purdue, Teva, Cephalon, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen. A company affiliated with Purdue pleaded guilty of felony fraud in connection with its marketing of OxyContin, but none of its executives went to prison.

Drug companies employed roughly the same strategy as street-corner pushers: Get somebody hooked and business will take care of itself. So last year, Americans received 236 million opioid prescriptions — that’s about one bottle for every adult.

A Senate investigation found that one company, Insys Therapeutics, successfully redirected a powerful opioid called Subsys, meant for cancer pain, to patients without cancer. Sarah Fuller, a woman with neck and back pain, was prescribed Subsys by her doctor, who received payments from Insys.

Fuller died of an overdose of Subsys.

Meanwhile, Insys had the best-performing initial public offering in 2013, and revenue tripled in the next two years, the Senate report said. Likewise, the Sackler family, owner of the company that makes OxyContin, joined Forbes’s list of richest American families in 2015, with $14 billion.

It’s maddening that the public narrative is still often about an opioid crisis fueled by the personal weakness and irresponsibility of users. No, it’s fueled primarily by the greed and irresponsibility of drug lords — including the kind who inhabit executive suites. The Washington Post quoted a former D.E.A. official as referring to pharmaceutical company representatives as “drug dealers in lab coats.”

I was invited the other day to a gala honoring the C.E.O. of one of these pharma companies for his moral leadership. I wanted to throw up. Since 2000, more than 200,000 Americans have died from overdoses of prescription opioids — the consequence of a deliberate strategy to make money by ignoring public welfare.

Our pattern of opioid addiction points to a tragedy, driven by the greed of some of America’s leading companies and business executives, systematically manipulating doctors and patients and killing people on a scale that terrorists could never dream of.

Tricky Clues

1A: “Agcy. for Kennedy and Reagan” is TSA because the clue is referring to the airports, not the presidents after which they are named.

28A: PREGGERS makes its New York Times crossword debut today, clued as “With child, informally.”

122A: This was too good to pass up. At first, I thought these were the kind of chocolate cups you make using a balloon and melted chocolate, but it turns out that we’re talking about the universe’s gift to personkind, the REESE’s peanut butter cup. And the man who first got peanut butter in his chocolate was H.B. REESE. I made sure to indulge in a few of these cups, just to make absolutely sure they were still a thing. No need to thank me. I’m happy to do the research so you don’t have to.

11D: A pun that rhymes. “Divine bovine?” is a SACRED COW.

39D: I think this clue is a nod to Brendan Emmett Quigley’s 2001 debut of the entry “WHY, YOU LITTLE ...” and it’s a great one. The answer, “SON OF A ...,” is also fairly unique, as it was used once in a 1965 puzzle as a fill-in-the-blank clue referring to a biblical quote.

43D: Clue of the Day, in my opinion. “Several quarter turns?” does not refer to actually turning something manually or screwing something in. It refers to the action of a COIN TOSS, when a quarter is turning in the air. I love visually evocative clues like that.

80D: A “System of roots?” sounds on the surface like it refers to a plant. Today it refers to ETYMOLOGY, the study of the origins of words, their roots, and how language has changed over time.

Constructor Notes

Erik Agard: Music and wordplay are but two of Alex’s superpowers (you can see some of her punny drawings on her Instagram), so when this puzzle’s then-half-formed theme needed rescuing, I knew who to shine the Bat Signal for. Through a couple revisions and upwards of a hundred emails, the collaboration was always fun, and I’m looking forward to her next puzzle. Alex Briñas: Erik was the true superhero here — he zipped nimbly through the bulk of the work and picked up after all my snafus. I’m a super-newbie to everything in the crossword world, but I do enjoy myself a good pun every now and then, so this was fascinating and foreign and exciting and daunting all at once. And I owe much thanks to Erik for inviting me to sidekick this mission in the first place. For your enjoyment (we hope), here are some of the theme answers from the cutting room floor: [Human Torch’s favorite band?] (3,7,4) [Blade’s favorite band?] (7,7) [Wonder Twins’ favorite band?] (5) [Storm’s favorite rapper?] (6) [Beast’s favorite singer?] (6) [Wolverine’s favorite guitarist?] (5) [Lady Deathstrike’s favorite band?] (13) [Banshee’s favorite band?] (5,5)

Unlike Weinstein, Nassar is in jail, awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct. He already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges — he denies the many accusations of sexual assault — and faces decades of prison time.

Regardless of how many charges are leveled, or how many lawsuits are filed, we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one Maroney told on Wednesday. It’s sickens me to consider that there are probably many, many more. But now we know Maroney was one of them, and odds are she won’t be the last raise her hand to say, “Me Too.”

Maroney, 21, said her abuse at the hands of Nassar began when she was 13. On Tuesday, the former Soviet gymnast and Olympic gold medalist Tatiana Gutsu also said, “Me, too.” Gutsu did so on Facebook, accusing not a doctor but an ex-Olympic teammate, Vitaly Scherbo, of raping her in 1991, when she was 15.

“This is me being brave after 27 years,” Gutsu wrote. She called Scherbo a “monster who kept me in my own prison to be afraid for so many years.”

If you’re taken aback by this wave of raw honesty, and surprised by the sheer numbers of “Me Too” posts out there, then you’re probably not a woman. To so many of us, too many of us, none of this is new.

During a congressional hearing about sexual abuse in sports in March, Rick Adams, the chief of Paralympic sports for the United States Olympic Committee, sat between two gymnasts and testified that the “Olympic community failed the people it’s supposed to protect.”

Those people who remained unprotected were athletes. Young ones. Older ones. Ones who have had to carry the burden of abuse for years, their lips zipped and their hearts heavy. Ones whose parents had entrusted them to coaches, adults who were supposed to keep those children safe. Ones who attended national gymnastics team training camps at Bela and Martha Karolyi’s rural Texas ranch, where Nassar often met with the gymnasts in their rooms, alone, and molested them.

Some of the athletes whispered among themselves that they felt uncomfortable with Nassar’s so-called techniques. But the stories stayed secrets. The gymnasts’ careers were on the line.

“Wherever there is a position of power, there seems to be potential for abuse,” Maroney wrote. “I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting.”

The Nassars and the Weinsteins of the world who haven’t been outed yet should be worried about “Me Too.” Because now that women can see that they’re not alone, more will speak up, because so many of them have stories to tell. Like me.

There was the time when I covered Nascar in the 1990s and was cornered by a top driver in the back of his trailer while trying to conduct an interview. As the cars roared around the racetrack, he blocked the door and said he wouldn’t let me leave unless I kissed him. The team’s publicist saved me by knocking on the door.

Or the time when another driver kept putting his hand on my leg as I sat next to him during a group interview. Or the meeting at the Olympics where a man in public relations threw himself at me, hands grabbing, as soon as he closed his office door, forcing me to talk my way out of the room.

I thought all of those experiences were just par for the course for a woman in sports, and, in many ways, it turns out they were. But those moments were degrading and frustrating and isolating — after all, I just wanted to do my job, like anyone else — and so I never shared those details. I couldn’t believe that I’d ended up in those situations, and was embarrassed.

Without the boldness of so many other women, as so many of them join hands to pull back the curtain on this problem, I still might have preferred to say nothing.

Eugene Smith Memorial Fund’s 2017 grant in Humanistic Photography for his project on the European migrant and refugee crisis.

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent.","You know all those bespoke experiences that American urbanites have been reviving: the artisanal butcher and barber shops, the gourmet grocer and the community bookstore? In Australia, though weakened by shopping centers, they never really died.

This is still a place where many Australians can buy a novel, sausages and shampoo in three different shops, each owned by a neighbor with children at the local school.

Big box stores are rare and independent bookstores are strong: Their sales accounted for around 26 percent of Australia’s book business in 2015, according to Nielsen, up from 20 percent in the late 2000s, more than double the share for independents in the United States.

Romantics (and some booksellers) argue that Australians simply favor local offerings. Cynics (and some economists) argue that many Australians are just wealthy and complacent, unfamiliar with more convenient alternatives that they’ll eventually embrace and come to love.

Regardless, this much is clear: Amazon’s arrival is a stress test not just for individual retail categories but also for Australia’s own writing, and way of life.

“Our culture is, and all cultures are, being swamped by outside influences,” Mr. Rubbo said. “We’re fighting to defend our voice.”

What Do You Want and When Do You Want It?

Amazon’s first “fulfillment center” in Australia sits at the intersection of several highways about an hour south of central Melbourne. There are food companies and warehouses for Penguin Random House nearby, and inside, room for millions of products.

Union organizers say they are watching the location closely to ensure that new hires receive Australia’s minimum wage of roughly 18 Australian dollars, around $14.50. But on a recent visit, the warehouse was empty except for a few gray shelves in the middle of a gray floor. The only employees were construction workers clad in neon-green and finishing a bathroom.

What comes next is anyone’s guess. Amazon turned down requests for an interview, and did not respond to emails with specific questions.

The company is known for this sort of thing, preferring buzz to transparency, and here in Australia, that’s led to excitement for many who are hoping for an easier, much broader online shopping experience — along with real estate speculation in the warehouse market, the rollout of a new free delivery service by Australia’s postal service, and what the chief executive at one large retailing conglomerate described as “a healthy sense of paranoia.”

Booksellers know the feeling. Amazon hasn’t explained why it’s taken so long to bring its full retail operation to Australia but Australians have been able to order from Amazon’s American site for years and even with shipping costs, book prices are often equal to or cheaper than what can be found in Sydney or Melbourne.

There are other digital booksellers already in Australia too, including Book Depository, an Amazon subsidiary from Britain, and Booktopia, a start-up that nearly went public last year.

Tony Nash, the chief executive of Booktopia, which according to the company, controls about 4 percent of Australia’s book market, said that Amazon has already made everyone more competitive.

Booktopia, for example, now uses conveyors, automatic packing machines and a staff of 150 people to get books into customers’ hands, in some cases on the same day they’re ordered.

“It’s not about price,” Mr. Nash said. Especially in countries with small widely dispersed populations like Canada and Australia, where 24 million people are spread across a continent the size of the United States, “it’s about the logistics.”

But isolation, as Australians know better than most, can help and hurt.

Sean Guy, a manager at The Bookshop in Darwin, Australia’s northernmost major city, said if he lived in a more isolated community like Alice Springs, in the nation’s interior desert region, “I’d probably find it a lot easier to go online for five minutes than call the local bookshop.”

For most everyone else, he added, bricks-and-books still work.

“You’ll never be able to beat the prices of Amazon, but you can save on time by going into a store,” he said. “And people like supporting local businesses.”

Australians already buy more books per capita than Americans (based on Nielsen sales figures) and spend more hours reading.

Michael Heyward, the publisher at Text, an independent publisher with a mix of new and established Australian writers, including Helen Garner, said that maybe Australia’s built up enough independence to live with Amazon in peace.

“I would like to believe we can have our cake and eat it,” he said in an interview at his office in Melbourne.

But just below his own bookish calm — and the not-so-secret hope that Amazon will help sell more books — there are wider concerns.

“Let’s not outsource our minds to the narcissism of the global algorithm,” warned Anna Funder, the author of “Stasiland” and “All That I Am,” at a booksellers conference last year. And she’s not alone.

“People who work in the book industry are agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce,” said Tim Winton, the author of Australian classics like “Cloudstreet,” and one of Australia’s best-known writers. “When you take away their role as agents of culture and reduce them to instruments of capitalism, it changes the dynamic.”

In interviews with more than a dozen booksellers, authors, independent publishers and lawyers specializing in copyright, two worst-case scenarios emerged.

One, widely considered the more likely, involves Amazon convincing Australia’s big publishers to provide steep discounts and promises of faster delivery, driving down prices and author royalties for all books, and possibly putting independent booksellers’ orders at the end of the line.

“Amazon controls the negotiating process,” said David Gaunt, the co-owner of Gleebooks in Sydney. “If they choose to sell the new Richard Flanagan book at $9.99,” he added, referring to Australia’s last winner of the Man Booker Prize, who has a new novel out, “we’ll sell none.”

The second nightmare scenario, according to booksellers and authors, is that Amazon will find a way to tilt Australia’s labor, tax and import laws in its favor.

Stock grants for employees could be used to decrease tax liability, as Amazon has done in Europe. What else Amazon might do is a question lawyers and consultants are already gaming out, while lobbying the Australian government, which at this point seems determined to protect its own.

Starting in July, a new digital services tax will be levied on all online purchases of 1,000 Australian dollars, or roughly $780, or less. Netflix, eBay and Amazon will all be affected.

Australian lawmakers have also resisted calls from economists on the government’s own Productivity Commission to eliminate the country’s parallel import restrictions. The rules essentially give Australian publishers a national monopoly over any book they publish. Booksellers are not allowed to import books from another country if the book has been published by an Australian copyright holder within 30 days of overseas release and if the Australian publisher can supply the book within 90 days.

Critics say the rules are protectionist, and a cause of overpriced books.

But these restrictions, copyright lawyers say, should keep Amazon from stocking its warehouses with cheaper books shipped in from abroad. And they are widely seen by authors as the foundation of Australia’s literary culture.

The copyright law that went into effect in May 1969 essentially created a protected market in a country that, until then, had relied almost entirely on Britain for its books.

Now, many authors say, any effort to soften the rules or let Amazon skirt them would weaken local publishers, reduce royalty rates and return Australia to a reliance on outsiders who may not care to publish the array of Australian authors now in circulation.

“What makes me anxious is this sort of return to a centralizing of cultural power,” said Mr. Winton, who has published more than two dozen books for adults and children. For Australia, he said, Amazon may represent a step backward: “It’s a retrograde move.”

Price vs. Personal Interaction

Inside the Readings flagship store on Lygon Street, Australian authors get prominent displays on front tables and on the first shelves people see.

At Riverbend Books in Brisbane, another independent bookseller well known to publishers and authors, roughly 60 percent of the books are written by Australians.

Would Amazon give local authors the same level of promotion? Will it publish and print its own books in Australia or make sellers of used books more dominant? Will it undermine or compete with the community ethos that bookstores like Readings represent?

“We have a lot of questions,” said Mr. Rubbo, 69, a quiet, casual man with intense blue eyes who has expanded Readings to seven locations in and around Melbourne over the past 41 years.

He said that since the arrival of Borders in 2002, Readings and many other bookstores have strengthened their bonds with local authors and readers. Events are now the norm; Readings will do 260 this year alone.

The strongest independent bookstores, while maintaining a 1990s feel at times, complete with racks of music CDs, are also linked up with universities and schools and Australia’s well-known writers festivals in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere.

Many customers, while open to buying some items from Amazon, seem pleased with the status quo for books. “I like seeing the physical book itself, and the chance to find things you wouldn’t find otherwise,” said Sonya Theys, 24, who was browsing at Readings one recent evening.

Authors are even more zealous. “If literature is a religion, the bookstore is the church,” said Alec Patric, an award-winning novelist who also happens to work at Readings. “It’s a delicate equilibrium.”

Amazon’s deals with publishers could upset all of that. Mr. Rubbo said he has pressed them to keep the playing field even, to not give Amazon any special treatment with delivery time or price.

Suzy Wilson, the owner of Riverbend, has made the same case to major Australian publishers. She said she was told not to fret. “They were giving me a bit of a pep talk really,” she said.

But as negotiations between Amazon and local publishers continue, the major players are staying silent. Penguin Random House and Hachette turned down requests for comment. Michael Gordon-Smith, the chief executive of the Australian Publishers Association, sent a statement by email: “We welcome any new ways to get books to Australian readers and any new investment in the Australian industry that is consistent with good corporate citizenship and respect for creators’ rights.”

Ms. Wilson and Mr. Rubbo both said that Amazon’s power could bend the will of even the well-intentioned. In their nightmares, they see declining revenues, shuttered stores and silent, dying neighborhoods.

“It’s really crucial that these places survive and thrive,” Ms. Wilson said. “I wish I was more optimistic.”",Australia’s Amazon Book Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/books/australias-amazon-book-battle.html

On Wednesday, 2012 Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney became the latest and most decorated American gymnast to speak out about being sexually abused by Larry Nassar, who served as the USA Gymnastics women’s team doctor for two decades. “It started when I was 13 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn’t end until I left the sport,” Maroney, now 21, wrote of Nassar on Twitter.

“Is it possible for survivors to speak out, without putting careers, and dreams in jeopardy?” Maroney asked. There is increasingly good reason to think that the answer is yes.

Nassar is facing 33 charges of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan and pleaded guilty to federal pornography charges in July; he is expected to spend decades in prison. Last August, the floodgates opened after Rachael Denhollander, who says she was abused by the doctor as a 15-year-old gymnast in Michigan, filed a criminal complaint for sexual assault against Nassar, who was also a faculty member at Michigan State University and team physician at a local club. Now some 140 individuals have accused him of sexual abuse.

After revelations of Nassar’s widespread abuse over several decades, Aly Raisman, a 2012 and 2016 Olympian, criticized USA Gymnastics this summer for its handling of Nassar and for not doing enough to help his victims. She called out the fact that Steve Penny, the former USA Gymnastics president who resigned in March amid criticism that the organization did not act quickly enough, reportedly received a $1 million severance package. Raisman, who has not claimed that she herself suffered abuse, wants to compete in the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Publicly criticizing your sport’s own governing body when you hope to again compete at the highest level is a gutsy move — and a sign of a significant cultural shift in the sport.

In 2008, Dominique Moceanu — a wunderkind who won the gold at 14 years old at the 1996 Atlanta Games — claimed that her coaches, Martha and Bela Karolyi, had physically and emotionally abused her. “I never, ever objected to hard work,” she told The Los Angeles Times. “What I objected to was Martha grabbing me by the neck, shoving my face into the phone and telling me to call my parents when I hurt my neck in practice.”","McKayla Maroney Says, ‘Me Too.’ What Happens Next?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/mckayla-maroney-nassar-abuse-gymnastics.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“Some have described Washington as the slowest town until it is the fastest town,” said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax Policy in the House Ways and Means Committee, “and I think that’s what’s going to happen here.”

Congressional Republicans are under intense pressure from campaign donors, business groups and the White House to deliver a major legislative victory after nine months of congressional disappointment on big issues. Party leaders say they have learned from those setbacks, including the collapse of the health care push this summer.

Lawmakers “should have had a bill six months ago,” said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, who is advising the White House on the tax effort. “They will look so incompetent if they don’t get this done,” he said, adding that Republicans know the economy could suffer and that they could lose badly in the midterm elections next year if they do not pass something quickly. “Ultimately, that’s why I’m optimistic.”

The bills being drafted, as described by top Republicans and lobbyists, would affect family budgets across the United States, by altering tax brackets and some popular deductions, and investment decisions around the globe, by changing the way the United States taxes multinational companies. It centers on deep cuts to business tax rates, which Republicans promise will deliver income gains to middle-class workers.

Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress released an outline of their plan in September, which included reducing the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, a doubling of the standard deduction for individual income tax filers and the elimination of several widely claimed deductions for individuals. The framework put down a marker but left dozens of questions unresolved, many of them potentially worth billions of dollars to businesses and the federal government.

Business groups are meeting frequently with key Republicans, seeking to shape the bill, but no snippets of legislative text have yet become public.

However, party leaders cannot finalize a bill until another budget hurdle is cleared — the Senate and House must agree on a consensus budget document, which will include instructions for how much a tax bill could reduce federal tax revenues over the next decade. That document, which would be an agreement between the House and Senate, is crucial to allowing Republicans to change tax law without any Democratic support. Such agreement could come quickly or drag out over a week or more, depending on whether House members agree to the Senate version or demand substantial changes to it.

Republican leaders hope to finalize and introduce the House version of the tax bill as soon as early November, allow amendments from both parties in committee and on the House floor, and pass something by Thanksgiving. Senate leaders hope to pass a bill by December or early next year.

Democrats say that process does not allow time for careful consideration of the bill, or for the sort of bipartisan compromise that marked the 1986 effort.

“I can’t imagine that something this momentous would be done without hearings, when you consider they’re about to fundamentally alter the architecture of the nation’s revenue collection,” said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.

Republican leaders say there has been enough discussion of tax issues to warrant a fast vote. The House Ways and Means Committee has conducted more than 40 hearings on tax issues over the past five years, and the Senate Finance Committee has held 70.

“The quicker we can get this done, the quicker we can start growing the economy,” said Matthew M. Miller, a vice president for the Business Roundtable who handles tax issues. “There’s been thorough opportunity to have discussions on what the policy needs to be.”

Michael A. Steel, a managing director at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington and a longtime aide John A. Boehner, the former House speaker, said that he expected “an intense, if not frenetic” debate between the introduction of the bill and the votes in committee and on the floor. Businesses, he added, were preparing their arguments in the hopes of changing any provisions that could hurt them financially.

He said he was optimistic that the House could finish its work by the end of November — a contrast to several fiscal fights waged in late December when Mr. Boehner was speaker and Barack Obama was president.

“This is a wrinkle, having a legislative deadline threaten Thanksgiving,” Mr. Steel said. “We usually screw up Christmas.”",Republicans Ready to Move on a Tax Plan Few Have Seen,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/tax-bill-trump-senate.html

For the honey badger, it’s whatever works: anti-Semite one day; Israel’s make-believe champion the next. Bannon is the most revolting operator in American political life since Roy Cohn. He is also the most consequential one.

In his speech, Bannon asked of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell: “Who’s going to be Brutus to your Julius Caesar”? Caesar was stabbed 23 times on the floor of the Roman Senate on the 15th of March, 44 B.C. John Wilkes Booth also invoked Brutus from the stage of Ford’s Theatre after he had assassinated Lincoln, the father of the Republican Party. This is what now passes for acceptable speech among the G.O.P.’s “values voters.”

Bannon thinks he can get away with this because he already has. He did so to spectacular effect last year with Donald Trump, and again last month in Alabama with Judge Roy Moore. He will run this play as often as he can, whether his candidates win or lose. The goal isn’t to win elections but to purge the party and remake it in Bannon’s image. He wasn’t kidding when he told historian Ronald Radosh in 2013 that he’s a “Leninist.”

It also helps Bannon that the Roll-Over Republicans who might oppose him lack the political courage to do so. Winston Churchill said of the neutral countries in World War II, “each one hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last.” Think of Paul Ryan as the moral equivalent of Norway.

What might stop Bannon? Nobody should expect G.O.P. invertebrates to ever gain a spine. But Judge Moore is in a dead heat with Doug Jones, his Democratic opponent, in what should be the easiest Republican cakewalk of the season. Even the stupid party might remember its Senate nominations of Delaware’s Christine “I’m not a witch” O’Donnell and Missouri’s Todd “legitimate rape” Akin.

But parties need more than just the spur of defeat to give voters a sense of moral belonging and political purpose, and in his speech Monday McCain did that:

“We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. We are the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad. We have done great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we have become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did. We have a moral obligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than shame on ourselves if we don’t. We will not thrive in a world where our leadership and ideals are absent. We wouldn’t deserve to.”

Hold a counter-rally outside of where Mr. Spencer is speaking to protest him and his ilk. You may be relieved and reassured to see who stands with you — as the poet Allen Ginsberg wrote, “Candor ends paranoia” — and the numbers you draw to your cause might well send its own message. Counter-protesting may prove cathartic, an empowering reminder of your own agency and the dynamic potential of political organizing. In our liberal democracy, the old civil libertarian saw — “answer speech with more speech” — is still good advice.

Remember that humor is a powerful tool, even (perhaps especially) when you are confronting issues of grave importance. A cutting joke can deflate bombast, educate the public, and convince the unaware or unconvinced to stand with you. My boss, a comic book nerd, is particularly fond of the counterprotests in response to the Westboro Baptist Church demonstration at Comic-Con. While Westboro Baptist members displayed messages like “God Hates You,” comic book fans carried signs saying, “All Glory to the HypnoToad,” and “Magnets: How the #?*! Do They Work?” Humorous counter-protests undercut the gravitas that groups like the Westboro Baptist Church and speakers like Mr. Spencer are trying to accrue.

It may also be useful to hear Mr. Spencer in his own words, so as to more effectively combat his ideas. Track his factual assertions and refute them. Catalog his statements and expose them. Ask questions. To paraphrase Justice Louis Brandeis, shining sunlight upon Mr. Spencer’s beliefs may prove to be powerful disinfectant. Polling shows that his ideas are unpopular; remind people why. As the gay rights activist Jonathan Rauch said of one gay rights opponent, “The more he talks, and the more we talk, the better we sound.”

Finally, avoid violence. Nothing would make a provocateur like Mr. Spencer happier than a violent attempt at shutting him down. Violence generates still more attention for his cause, while sacrificing the moral clarity of peaceful protest. It frightens away potential supporters, alienates the public and allows opponents to claim that “both sides” are at fault. Most dangerously, engaging in violence will only guarantee more in return, whether from one’s political adversaries or the state. As the research of Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at the University of Denver, demonstrates, engaging in violence has historically empowered fascists, who are experts in its use.

Backed by American-led coalition airstrikes, Iraq government forces celebrated their recapture of the city in July. But Mosul’s recovery is a tale of two cities.

In the eastern portion, somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of the population that fled during initial fighting over the city have already returned to their homes. But nine months of fighting in the west of Mosul, where militants holed up during their final stand, left the area virtually uninhabitable.

From medical centers to centuries-old mosques, major structures were reduced to rubble and whole neighborhoods wiped off the map. Some fell at the hands of militants who demolished infrastructure as the Iraqi military moved in, including the iconic Al Nuri mosque and its leaning minaret, and some were casualties of coalition airstrikes. Before the Islamic State captured the city, Mosul was home to 1.1 million people. United Nations officials estimate that just restoring basic services there could cost more than $1 billion.

Leila Jane Nassif, the United Nations refugee agency’s assistant representative in Iraq, said the damage in the western part of the city had left hundreds of thousands of people displaced. It is unclear when they will be able to return.

“It will take time for the infrastructure to be in place and for people to be able to rebuild their lives there with so much housing that has been damaged,” Ms. Nassif said in a telephone interview.

Of course, ginning up such a high level of intimacy and trust with a stranger could get weird. I cried with several interviewees. Two wanted to hear, off the record, about my experience getting sober. I got asked out once — very politely and respectfully, and with flattering, wistful chagrin when I said I was married. A handful of genuinely famous people told me to “stay in touch,” and I think a few of them even meant it. Dan Rather told me I should call my father and tell him I love him (which I immediately did). DJ Khaled gave me his cellphone number and offered to give me a pep talk whenever I needed it, a favor I am saving for some particularly dark night of the soul.

These giant shrooms typically pop up in acidic soils near spruce, oak or birch trees and when they get enough rain. While Mr. Reisz admires them, he probably won’t be feeding these magical-looking mushrooms to his children. They contain two mind-altering neurotoxins called ibotenic acid and muscimol which are known to affect humans and other animals.

Strange things can happen when mammals ingest them, too. In January, news reports suggested that eating fly agaric fungi made fearless coyotes terrorize motorists in the moonlight in California. Reindeer historically have tripped on them too, and in some places fly agaric has even been associated with Christmas. Some historians even chalk the victories of Viking “Beserker Warriors” to the fearlessness induced after ingesting Amanita muscaria.

In studies using rats, muscimol was infused into parts of the amygdala, a brain region that is known to process emotional fear memories in humans. The drug shut down the rats’ ability to learn about and respond to threats.

But in humans, it can also do the opposite. Its effects range from dry mouth and rapid heartbeat to euphoria, hallucinations, feeling closer to God and fear.

Incorrect doses or preparations are poisonous. In at least one case, doctors found the fly agari in the stomach contents of a person found in a coma. Additionally, Amanita muscaria are often confused with relatives: deadly impostors known as the death cap and the destroying angel.

Mr. Reisz thinks that maybe the mushrooms he found were able to get so big and numerous because of recent weather, and that other locals, seeking them for their psychoactive properties, had not yet picked them.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

The Weinstein Investigation

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

As anyone who read “IQ” will know, Ide isn’t a one-plot type of writer. He sets many schemes in motion. In the new novel, they involve gambling, a natty Rwandan Hutu gangster who lost one leg to the Tutsi, Chinese triads, money-laundering, human trafficking and a whole lot more. Ide writes about the hostility among ethnic groups — notably black gangs and Chinese triads (whose members’ affectation of American gang habits comes in for some mockery, though their toughness does not) — in ways that would be offensive if they weren’t equal-opportunity insults. The world of these books is one of constant trash talk, and Ide delivers it with style.

None of it comes from Isaiah. He remains the one stand-up guy in the midst of hot- and cold-running human detritus. But eight years have changed him. He’s no longer the boy wonder we first met. He’s a grown man with no concrete future plans who solves neighborhood crimes mostly as favors — until he suddenly discovers motivation. (Dodson is now a family man, settled down with a woman who can talk back to him and a “Lil’ Tupac” expected any day.)

The galvanizing force is Sarita, Marcus’s girlfriend. When Isaiah crosses paths with her again, he starts imagining an adult life with wine, an actual sofa and the woman of his dreams.

Will Ide lead Isaiah toward happiness? The book’s battles play out ingeniously, with Isaiah trying to figure out how he could have been so wrong about Marcus. He is also hired by a seemingly reputable Chinese father to rescue a daughter who has severe gambling problems. A lot of characters crop up in “Righteous”; one reason is that the trail Marcus left was a complicated one, but another is that Ide can’t seem to resist a good subplot when he thinks of one. A third possibility may be that this series plans to move on. Like “IQ,” the new book has an ending that will make you hope for the arrival of another installment, pronto.

“Righteous” takes its title from a quality that Marcus was thought to represent and that Isaiah still embodies. It seems possible, by the novel’s end, that Isaiah has done what he can in East Long Beach and is ready to take on the wider world.

Music — including favorites like Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in D major — played in her head when she ran, helping her through monotonous stretches of the course.

Harriette Brenneman Line was born on March 27, 1923, in Carlisle, Pa. Her father, J. Harvey Line, was a lawyer, and her mother, the former Harriet Brenneman, was a homemaker who taught her daughter to play the piano. An athletic girl who wanted to get places quickly, young Harriette preferred running, bicycling and roller skating to walking.

She attended Dickinson College in her hometown before receiving a music scholarship to attend Syracuse. She married Sydnor Thompson Jr., a lawyer and judge, two hours after they both graduated in 1947.

Throughout her life Ms. Thompson maintained her focus on music as she raised her children. She taught piano at Boston University and earned an artist’s diploma from the Vienna Conservatory. She performed at Carnegie Recital Hall (now Weill Recital Hall) and on the cruise ship Queen Elizabeth II. She received a master’s in music from the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, and played benefit concerts at the Aspen Chapel during the summers she spent in Aspen, Colo.

When she moved to a retirement community, she brought her Bösendorfer concert grand with her.

In addition to her son Brenneman, Ms. Thompson is survived by another son, Sydnor III; three daughters, Darcy Howard, Harriet Moore and Katherine Kelly; and 11 grandchildren. Her husband died two years ago.

Ms. Thompson ran two five-kilometer races recently and in June returned to San Diego, where she jogged and walked a 13.1-mile half-marathon. She was such a crowd favorite that she had to be protected from well-wishers by family members. Women wanted to take selfies with Ms. Thompson.

Growing up, Ms. Bailey absorbed Gullah-Geechee culture even as she watched it shrink.
“I call it cultural genocide,” Ms. Bailey said in a video interview in 2013.
In 2004, Ms. Bailey received a Governor’s Award in the Humanities for her preservation work.","Ms. Bailey’s main preservation achievement may have simply been telling the stories of her ancestors and her own life, something she did eloquently in the memoir “God, Dr. Buzzard, and the Bolito Man: A Saltwater Geechee Talks About Life on Sapelo Island, Georgia” (2001, with Christena Bledsoe).

“Back in my youth in the 1940s and 1950s,” she wrote in the book, “we had five Geechee communities on Sapelo and more than 450 people. Today, we have one community left and fewer than 70 people; and I fear for the survival of my people on this island.”

Cornelia Walker Bailey was born on June 12, 1945. Her father, Hicks Walker, often worked for R. J. Reynolds Jr., the tobacco heir, at the mansion he owned on the island. The house had been the centerpiece of a plantation where, in the early 1800s, Thomas Spalding used slave labor to grow cotton, rice and sugar cane.

Ms. Bailey’s mother, Hettie Bryant, was, like many in the community, a believer in spirits; when the eyeglasses that she was sure she had left on a particular table would disappear, she would suspect a long-dead uncle of having moved them.

“Mama would call on the spirit of Uncle Shed to put her glasses back,” Ms. Bailey wrote, “and then she’d go and do her work and come back, and those glasses would be on the table right where she left them.”

Sapelo, which is about 11 miles long and part of a chain of barrier islands, is accessible only by boat or air. Today, almost all of it is owned by the state, but in the decades after the Civil War former slaves and their descendants bought land there and established several settlements. Ms. Bailey grew up in one of these, Belle Marsh, and wrote of a childhood that was both idyllic and rugged.

The family cooked with a wood stove, the dishes a genuine version of the Gullah cuisine trend now evident along the coast. They had, she wrote, “what most people would call an ‘outhouse’ but we called a ‘toilet,’ because we still used a few words from the French era of Sapelo and that was one of them.”

She would tell the story of how, when she was 3, she died — or so it appeared. She had become sick after eating unripe pears and seemed to expire. Her parents, who had already seen two infant sons die of fever, were preparing to bury her — they had a coffin made — when her mother’s sister, Mary, operating on some sixth sense, got some crushed garlic, “packed it in my nose, my mouth and God only knows where else, and I came around.”

After that, she said, everyone thought she had a some sort of special gift, an expectation that she could find burdensome.

“I just wanted to be a normal kid,” she wrote. “I didn’t want to be able to see the future or predict whether someone was gonna have a baby boy or girl. The only signs I wanted to read were the signs Papa could read from nature, like when the tide is right for fishing.”

Ms. Bailey traced her family to a man named Bilali Muhammad, an important slave on the Spalding plantation who is thought to have come from West Africa by way of the Caribbean and, like many other slaves, was a Muslim, a heritage evident in the distinctive Gullah-Geechee adaptations to the Christianity of their slave masters. When she was young, Ms. Bailey noted, children were taught to pray facing east; Sapelo women covered their hair in church.

Growing up, Ms. Bailey absorbed Gullah-Geechee culture even as she watched it shrink. It disappeared entirely from other barrier islands, and on Sapelo it was consolidated into one community, Hog Hammock, where she and her husband, Julius, acquired several pieces of property. They operated a guesthouse, the Wallow, and gave history-filled tours to visitors.

Photo

Ms. Bailey’s preservation battle was a difficult one, as young people left the island in search of higher education and jobs. In 1910 the island had a black population of 539; by 1970 it was estimated at 175, and when a reporter for The New York Times wrote about the island in 2012, it was around 50.

The island’s school closed in the 1970s. More recently, Sapelo’s limited amount of private land caught the eye of well-off people looking for vacation properties. Ms. Bailey did not want to see it go the way of nearby islands like Hilton Head, S.C., with its yachts and golf courses, and was blunt about her preferences.

“On the verge of sounding racist,” she told The Times in 2008, “which I have been accused of, which I don’t give a hoot — I would rather my community be all black. I would rather have my community what it was in the ’50s.”

In 2012, Hog Hammock residents were hit with a substantial property tax increase that some felt was an effort to drive out the remaining Geechee residents. “I call it cultural genocide,” Ms. Bailey said in a video interview in 2013. Some tax relief was negotiated, though the issue remains a concern.

In 2004, Ms. Bailey received a Governor’s Award in the Humanities for her preservation work.

Survivors include her husband as well as several children and grandchildren.

Although Gullah and Geechee — terms whose origins have been much debated and may trace to specific African tribes or words — are often used interchangeably these days, Ms. Bailey always stressed that she was Geechee. And, specifically, Saltwater Geechee (as opposed to the Freshwater Geechee, who lived 30 miles inland).

“We thought our speech was a bit more musical than theirs,” she wrote in her book, “because we talked a little faster, with fewer rest stops between our words, so that everything ran together. We’d listen to them and say, ‘Can’t they talk any faster than that? People don’t have all day.’ ”

Ms. Grovner said Ms. Bailey had been instrumental in a continuing effort by the Sapelo Island cultural society to establish a Geechee historical village on 25 acres on the island, where visitors could see how people cooked, planted and lived in times past.

“Hopefully we can get it up and going on her behalf,” Ms. Grovner said.","Cornelia Bailey, Champion of African-Rooted Culture in Coastal Georgia, Dies at 72",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/obituaries/cornelia-bailey-champion-of-african-rooted-culture-in-coastal-georgia-dies-at-72.html

9 Ways to Help You Become a Smarter Investor Image Credit Zach Meyer

Figuring out what is going on in financial markets isn’t easy, even for professionals who trade constantly. In fact, for many people, forgetting about day-to-day market swings and taking a long-term perspective may be the best approach.

Yet anyone saving for retirement or a house, a car or an education — or trying to amass a nest egg for any reason at all — needs to periodically check in to see where the financial world is heading.

The last several months have been particularly puzzling. Markets have continued to rise, despite geopolitical turmoil that might have set them back. To help you understand what’s happening and what to do, w e’ve pulled together some of the biggest issues in investing in a quarterly report.

Among the nine articles are analyses and explanations that provide an easy-to-understand introduction to investing (and perhaps amuse you along the way).

The Stock Market Charges Ahead, Despite the World’s Storms

Wall Street has responded to political turmoil and natural disasters with barely a shrug. The markets have been charging ahead, not just in the past several months but over the past eight years. Stock prices have risen and there are far fewer — if any — bargains, compared with the days right after the end of the financial crisis in 2009.

All of which raises a big question: What are the prospects for a continuing bull market — or a major decline?

Where Do All the Disgraced C.E.O.s Go?

Richard F. Smith left Equifax in September after the company came under fire for a cybersecurity breach that compromised the personal information of potentially millions of consumers. Mike Cagney left Social Finance, the student loan company he had co-founded, after reports of allegations of sexual harassment and the company’s “frat house” culture. And then there is the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein , who was fired by his own company after years of allegations of sexual harassment and payoffs to accusers.

Chief executives seem to be stepping down from their posts — voluntarily or not — every day. Where do they go after they leave a scandal-ridden company? Here are some whimsical thoughts on a suitable destination for the besmirched.

Investing by Betting on the Sponsors of Sports

Invest in what you know: That’s an old mantra, and it makes a lot of sense. But what if what you know is, basically, sports?

If you’re not a billionaire and can’t buy teams or leagues outright, it will be difficult to invest in them directly: Most teams and leagues aren’t publicly traded.

So a sportscaster and a financial planner have started a new fund that enables avid fans to place indirect bets. This exchange-traded fund tracks companies that sponsor sports teams or broadcasters. The fund may be a comforting place for sports lovers to place their money, but buyer beware. It is largely untested.

The duo then carried the artworks to a nearby Metro station and casually boarded a train.

Just two cool customers who just pulled off the most brazen daylight art heist ever captured on film?

Non. The two are Louvre copyists, upholders of what Ivan Guilbert, a Parisian photojournalist, calls “a beautiful tradition” that dates to the French Revolution. In November 1793, one month after Marie Antoinette was beheaded, the revolutionary national assembly declared the Louvre Palace, Louis XIV’s former residence on the Right Bank of the Seine, open to the public. All citizens were welcomed to enjoy the national art treasures stored there, previously for the pleasure of the golden carriage set only.

Called the Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic, the people’s musée took the democratic ideal a step further. Any professional, amateur or aspiring painter was invited to enter the museum, set up an easel — provided free of charge to this day — and have a go at copying a masterpiece.

Thousands have since followed suit. Among them are such art history boldfaced names as Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí. The goal for them, and the present-day copyists whom Mr. Guilbert photographed for Le Parisien Magazine, is to learn the secrets of color, technique and composition by copying the works of some of the greatest artists of all time. “It’s like a free school,” says Mr. Guilbert.

“You have to copy and recopy the masters,” Degas once said, “and it’s only after having proved oneself as a good copyist that you can reasonably try to do a still life of a radish.”

The ambitions of the copyists Mr. Guilbert photographed went well beyond fruits and vegetables. Marius Allier, a 26-year-old graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, drew crowds as he tackled Eugène Delacroix’s “Women of Algiers (in their Apartment).” The 1834 painting presents challenges that have made it long popular among copyists, including Picasso, who later painted his own variations in the 1950s.

Catherine Balpe, an amateur painter, copied Theodore Chasseriau’s 1843 portrait, “The Two Sisters,” as a gift for her husband. Sam Rachamin journeyed from his home in Israel to render his copy of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s 1808 painting, “The Bather.”

Mr. Martin, 58, is a professional painter — but of houses, not canvases. A self-taught artist who paints using an easel and much smaller brushes when he’s not climbing ladders, copied “View of Pirna from the Sonnenstein Castle” by the Italian artist Bernardo Bellotto.

Though the Louvre, unlike other leading museums, does not charge copyists for the privilege, applicants can wait up to two years for one of the 250 permits the museum issues annually. Valid for three months, it allows them to work in the museum’s galleries from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. most days, except Sundays and holidays, from September through June.

Tourists and other museum visitors can bring cameras into the Louvre and take pictures. But because Mr. Guilbert planned to shoot for publication, he applied for, and received permission to spend three days in the galleries with the copyists. “For me, the assignment was like a romantic experience,” he says.

With the Louvre’s magnificent interior architecture enhancing the composition of his shots, Mr. Guilbert chose to use the same light that illuminates the masterworks, to strong effect. “I never used a flash,” he says. “It’s most interesting to work with what you’re given.”

Finished with their copies, Mssrs. Martin and Wald, a photographer who copied Agnolo Bronzino’s “Portrait of a Man Holding a Statuette,” met with Isabelle Vieilleville, director of the Louvre’s copy office. To guard against forgeries, she checked that the two copyists had used canvases that were one-fifth smaller or larger than the original, and that the original artists’ signatures were not reproduced on the copies. Then she stamped the backs of the canvases with a Louvre seal, added her own signature and escorted them from the museum.

On the train, masterworks in hand, they drew little more than a double take or two. “The Metro is like the subway in New York,” Mr. Guilbert said. “There was not really much reaction from the other passengers. They have seen it all.”

President Trump and Republicans in Congress have brought chaos to the American health care system by trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act and failing to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which, with bipartisan support for the past 20 years, has provided care for millions of children. Over the next few weeks they can choose to set things right or to destroy them.

Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray on Tuesday announced a bipartisan deal that could help stabilize the A.C.A.’s insurance markets and undo some of the damage Mr. Trump has done through administrative actions. In an ideal world, Congress would quickly pass that bill, which includes several Republican priorities, and, at the same time, reauthorize CHIP, which now covers nearly nine million children. But with Mr. Trump in the White House and feckless Republicans leading Congress, it’s possible that none of this will get done, health care costs will be driven up and millions of children will be left without health insurance.

First up, the Alexander-Murray deal represents real progress. These two no-nonsense lawmakers — the leading Republican and Democrat on the Senate health committee — have done yeoman’s work trying to fix a mess created largely by Mr. Trump. Their bill would appropriate money for payments to insurance companies that the president said he was stopping last week. He said they amounted to an illegal corporate bailout — a blatant lie. These payments, authorized by the A.C.A., or Obamacare, compensate insurers for lowering the deductibles and co-payments for low-income families. Further, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray would require the administration to spend $106 million on advertising and on people to help people sign up for insurance when open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Mr. Trump’s minions at the Department of Health and Human Services slashed spending on outreach efforts in recent months.

The deal also advances two Republican health care ideas: giving states more flexibility to make changes to the A.C.A. and letting more people sign up for high-deductible health care policies. Thankfully, Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray have made sure that neither of these changes undermines Obamacare’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions and the requirement that insurers cover essential health services like maternity care and cancer treatment. These changes could make the law function better by allowing sparsely populated states to attract more insurers by, for example, making it easier for them to set up reinsurance programs that protect companies from losses from a few customers. And the proposed high-deductible plans could work well for a small subset of people who buy A.C.A. policies but do not receive subsidies because they earn too much money.

While these compromises provide some hope for the A.C.A., CHIP’s fate, and health care for nine million children, is being held hostage by Republican extremists in the House. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Finance Committee — Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden — have worked together to extend the program, which expired on Sept. 30. But Republican House members such as Greg Walden of Oregon and Fred Upton of Michigan are demanding that spending on CHIP be offset by cuts to A.C.A. costs and unnecessary changes to Medicare and Medicaid. Of course, these same lawmakers who are so tightfisted with children’s medical care want to slash taxes on wealthy families with no effort to offset that loss of revenue.","Congress, End the Health Care Chaos.

The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis.
As President Trump thinks about whether to choose a new Fed leader, Ms. Yellen, whose term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy.

And President Trump’s rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Fed’s financial crisis response.","Over the course of Fed history, we find a dozen and a half other episodes of major overhaul. Some empower the Fed, others limit its autonomy, and some, like Dodd-Frank, do both. Controlling for the duration of recessions, Congress is more likely to amend the Federal Reserve Act when inflation and unemployment tick substantially higher.

Congress is also more likely to act when electoral rewards are greatest. If one party controls both the White House and Congress, voters know whom to reward or blame. If the parties divide power, voters have a harder time.

Congress is more likely to threaten action than to take it. Using legislative records to document lawmakers’ attention to the Fed, we examined all the bills introduced in the House and Senate between 1947 and 2014 that address the power, structure and governance of the central bank. Over nearly seven decades, 333 House and Senate members introduced 879 bills.

Fingers Point at the Fed When the Economy Misfires Higher unemployment is correlated with the number of congressional bills between 1947 and 2014 addressing the power and governance of the Fed. 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1960 1980 2000 bills introduced per year 60 50 40 30 20 10 0

Viewing the number of bills introduced each year (1947-2014) in the context of when the unemployment rate was above its median makes the pattern clear. When the economy hums, lawmakers leave the Fed alone. For example, congressional attention dropped markedly during Alan Greenspan’s Great Moderation starting in the 1980s, when the Fed tended to achieve its mandates. When the economy sours, most recently in the wake of the global financial crisis, reactive lawmakers pummel the Fed.

The Fed today remains caught in the cross hairs of partisan polarization. Republican proposals to limit its discretion, for instance, would require the Fed to adopt rate-setting monetary policy rules. Others want greater transparency from the Fed, such as allowing auditors to review monetary policy deliberations. Even though the current Fed is still occupied by Obama appointees, Democrats are also critical, favoring stronger limits on emergency lending.

Threats matter because they restrict Fed autonomy. Fed officials understand that responsiveness, sometimes even deference, to their congressional bosses lessens the chance that Congress and the president will revise the Federal Reserve Act.

Critics in Congress take aim at both monetary goals and tools. In July, the House financial services chairman, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, warned Ms. Yellen that the Fed should cease and desist from buying assets that venture into fiscal policy: “If we are not careful, we may wake up one day to find our central bankers have instead become our central planners.”

The Fed’s 2012 adoption of an inflation target also belies any notion of Fed independence. Ben Bernanke, then the Fed chairman, first broached the subject with his colleagues a decade earlier. Fed transcripts reveal acute sensitivity to securing congressional support. As Donald Kohn, then the Fed vice chairman, argued in 2008, “having an inflation target won’t have any effect if it is repudiated by the Congress.”

In the immediate wake of the financial crisis, the perceived political risk of setting a target again deterred Fed action. The Fed did not adopt its target until unemployment had finally subsided, years after the crisis. Even today, when former Fed officials recommend a higher inflation goal to generate greater growth, G.O.P. lawmakers direct Ms. Yellen not to change the target. Perhaps the Fed would be less eager to raise interest rates again if it could independently raise the inflation bar instead.

As President Trump thinks about whether to choose a new Fed leader, Ms. Yellen, whose term expires in February, and her colleagues have been busy normalizing monetary policy. A decade after the financial crisis and near generational lows in unemployment, the Fed is finally unwinding its four-plus-trillion-dollar balance sheet, gradually raising interest rates and keeping an eye on inflation that has been below the desired target.

This Fed seems eager to drop Mr. Bernanke’s crisis prescriptions. At her September news conference, however, Ms. Yellen reminded market participants that future policy makers would have a free hand to follow the Bernanke playbook the next time the country faces a financial crisis. Rates could return to zero, the balance sheet could be expanded, and so-called forward guidance could provide clear communication about future policy.

Political interdependence cautions against such certainty. Some of the contenders to replace Ms. Yellen, like Kevin Warsh and John Taylor, show little interest in Mr. Bernanke’s unconventional policies, underscoring the efficacy of congressional threats. And President Trump’s rare opportunity to overhaul the Board of Governors makes room for skeptics of the Fed’s financial crisis response.

Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point.
“I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said.
Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms.
These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of.","A pointillist, she creates pinpricks of emotion, but can easily go bigger than life, as she did to play Sydney, a con artist in the lollapalooza “American Hustle” (2013), a loose take on the Abscam scandal of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Slipping in and out of accents as well as plunging necklines, Adams — a virtuoso of complicated, seemingly contradictory moods — takes this shiny, flashy character and turns her into the most electric person in the movie. Adams studied acting for years and can cry at the drop of a dime, as she’s proved on more than one talk show. She has learned how to play the celebrity game: She knows how to chat up Jimmy Fallon, smile on the red carpet and keep cool when the paparazzi pounce. Significantly, she doesn’t give the gossip websites much material, even if she made a guest appearance in them this summer. “Fans freak that she’s pregnant after she wears flowy sundress,” one item exclaimed (erroneously). Adams seemed amused by the speculation. Stardom for women involves constant surveillance; shaking off these intrusions is crucial to maintaining and defending a private self.

A PARADOX OF stardom is that it depends on the appearance of an ordinary life. Some of this is about relatability, but it’s also about how actors fill performances up with their own humanity. In person, Adams seems nice, thoughtful, a touch vulnerable, which is how she sometimes appears on camera. (Big eyes help.) She also conveys appealing resilience. When she arrived for our interview she wasn’t accompanied by anxious handlers; when she left, she drove herself. She seems of our earth, not one of those exotic creatures whose celebrity becomes so otherworldly that it edges into camp. Yet like all stars, this palpable humanity comes with an ineluctable facility for both holding the screen and your attention. Adams seemed reluctant to see this in herself. When I mentioned Charlize Theron in passing, she lit up. “She can just sit on the couch, and you’re like, ‘That! That thing, what is it?’ That’s not me.”

I insisted that Adams was wrong, because while her appeal is different from Theron’s — Adams draws you to her, Theron keeps you at a distance — each makes you want to watch her and only her for as long as she’s on screen. Adams waved off the compliment. In someone else this might have read as false modesty, but she came across as someone who knows better than to trust other people’s admiration. It’s skepticism that feels grounded in experience. Adams found a manager soon after moving to Los Angeles in 1999 from Minnesota, where she had been working in dinner theater and dancing in regional musicals like “Brigadoon.” She was 24, with one movie credit (the 1999 beauty pageant satire “Drop Dead Gorgeous”), but she was also just another pretty young hopeful on a very crowded assembly line.

“I would go into auditions and it would be me and three model versions of me,” she said, “and I would never get the job.” It was the era of “Dawson’s Creek” and Katie Holmes. Adams did a lot of television (“I guest-starred on every WB show that was ever made”), but stripping down to a bikini to win a part wasn’t working for her. “I always thought it’s an ‘it’ factor and I just don’t have ‘it,’ ” she said. She credited her manager with helping her overcome self-doubt. “You get to decide what you want to be,” Adams recalled her manager telling her. “You get to decide that, Amy.”

She was still figuring it out when she landed the delectable role of an early 1960s candy striper in Steven Spielberg’s “Catch Me if You Can,” a 2002 biographical caper starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. As Brenda, Adams weeps through much of her first scene with DiCaprio, her eyes red and watery, a hand hovering over her mouth as her character tries to hide her metal braces. DiCaprio is playing the seducer, and Adams is a stand-in for us, the soon-to-be seduced. Later, after Brenda’s braces come off and she clambers into Frank’s lap, Adams complicates the character’s innocence with heat, letting you see the clumsy girl and desiring woman at once.

Critics singled out Adams’s performance, but she was a supporting player in a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle and, as she put it, the girl in braces: “It’s not like I had a beautiful gown with him walking down the steps of the Titanic.” The role brought her different kinds of auditions, but it was more a break than a breakthrough. When a writer friend pitched Adams to a studio for another project, the limits of Spielberg’s largess became conspicuous. The studio’s response, as Adams described it to me, was: “Oh, the homely girl from ‘Catch Me if You Can.’ ” That’s preposterous and offensive, and typical of the industry’s sexism. Adams, however, didn’t frame it that way: “I can’t blame anything other than I did not do my best at that point. I don’t think I inspired confidence.”

Confidence is a thread that wends through many stories about successful women who need to overcome not only their own insecurities but also a world that greets female achievement with ambivalence at best. When we spoke, Adams largely narrated her history in personal terms, but it was clear that the industry played its part. “I was getting ready to turn 30,” she said of the period that followed “Catch Me if You Can.” “I was tired of being unhappy and tired of chasing something that might not belong to me, like a career in film and television.” She was ready to let go of what she thought “being an actress was, or this idea of being a movie star, this idea of being ‘it,’ of being The Girl.” She was thinking of moving to New York to focus on her craft and start over. And then “Junebug” happened.

Adams’s role as a pregnant innocent, Ashley, in this little-seen 2005 independent movie was part of what became a slow-moving career trifecta. If “Catch Me if You Can” indicated that she was a fresh talent, “Junebug” suggested the richness of her range, showing her gift for moving from emotional lightness to darkness and back again. With crystalline sensitivity, Adams makes you care deeply about Ashley, whose virtue carries great narrative weight; even for those who didn’t respond to “Junebug” and its contrived hokum, the performance was a reminder of how a single actor can nearly redeem a movie. (It led to her first Oscar nomination.) Adams’s next leap forward came with the Disney hit “Enchanted,” which depends entirely on her to transform a high concept — a cartoon princess becomes human — into a delightful fairy story. Adams, who studied dance, sweeps into the movie with grace, tremulous feeling and fluttering hands, delivering an extraordinary performance that established that she had arrived at last.

SINCE THEN THERE have been juicier roles and steady acclaim and, of course, more Oscar nominations. In 2015, Adams married her longtime boyfriend, Darren Le Gallo, an artist she met in acting class, with whom she has a daughter, Aviana, named after Aviano, the Italian city where Adams, a military brat, was born. (Adams is one of seven children in a family that was Mormon until her parents’ divorce.) Having Aviana led Adams to again rethink her relationship to work. “I had to learn how to shut the door when I walk off the set. It’s hard and it doesn’t always work, but more often than not it does now,” she says. Long hours and location shoots can be tough on families, but having a husband who is willing to pack up with Adams helps. “We’ve realized we can be happy in an apartment in Detroit or a house in Hollywood or a hotel room,” she said. “It’s a good feeling, but I’m protective of it — very protective.”

It can be tricky shutting that door on a project like “Sharp Objects,” where she plays a reporter chasing a grisly story and where, for the first time, she has an executive producer credit. “What was exciting for me was being part of the creative development,” Adams said, “getting to feel comfortable speaking, feeling like that was my role now. Like, oh wait, I have an opinion and I’m going to share it!” She enjoyed it, but is unsure how much more producing she wants to do. “I can multitask,” she said, “it’s just an intense experience. And especially when you’re working every day of production, all day every day, in a dark character, and then trying to manage the other stuff — for me it was challenging.”

Those challenges extended to the set, including one day when, for a tricky single take, she had to crawl on a bathroom floor while weeping and drinking fake vomit she then had to spit up. As she was crawling and weeping and vomiting, a male crew member kept whispering the location of a prop until she finally barked, “I’ve got it, I’ve got it!” She apologized, explaining that she’d been staying in character. “He was trying to be helpful,” she told me. It’s the kind of response that I’d expected from Adams — but I had misunderstood her. I thought she was illustrating how she had gone to a psychologically dark place, but the point was that she knew she was right to call this man out. “I feel partially responsible for the tone that’s on set,” Adams said. “I’m sorry for how he felt, but I knew why I was doing that.”

Adams was standing up for herself, which is what we demand of women. What we sometimes forget, however, is that not every woman is going to speak up on her own behalf — or for other women — in exactly the same way or necessarily as a political declaration, and that she shouldn’t have to, either. What happened after Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in 2014 offers a good feminist case in point. Among all the ugly, embarrassing information that the hack revealed was that both Adams and Jennifer Lawrence had been paid less than their male co-stars in “American Hustle.” Lawrence went public with her feelings about the wage gap and was by turns praised and condemned for doing so. Adams said she was proud of Lawrence but made it repeatedly clear she didn’t want to discuss it in detail, if at all.

“I don’t want to talk about my own experience because I fight my own fight and I feel comfortable doing that,” Adams said when I mentioned the hack. And, as she admitted, “There’s not a lot of empathy out there for celebrities.” But the disparity that the Sony hack revealed made her curious. Years earlier, to prepare for some of her period movies, she had started reading books like “The Feminine Mystique.” (“I didn’t go to college. I didn’t do women’s studies. I had no idea.”) After the hack, she dug in again. “I spent a lot more time educating myself about what women executives get paid.” She read about C.E.O.s and teachers, the sociology and cultural conditioning.

“It’s important to talk about inequality,” Adams said. “But for me, where I feel most empowered is in educating myself and being, hopefully, a mentor for younger women. That’s more important. I offer any young actress I work with my phone number. I’ll tell them on set, ‘You don’t have to do that. You can say no.’ ” It seems like a modest gesture, but less so when you consider that the movie industry has long profited from female submission, from women acquiescing because their only choice is exploitation or unemployment. This is what makes women saying no powerful, and why it’s heartening that many are speaking up. Adams speaks up when she wants, how she wants, and she is saying yes — and no — on her own terms. These days, instead of telling her daughter “Don’t be bossy,” Adams asks her little girl who she is the boss of. “And she says, ‘Me.’ And I say, ‘That’s right. And you get to choose who you are.’ ”",The Versatile and Resilient Amy Adams,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/t-magazine/amy-adams.html

Sometimes, it’s the only thing to say.","We were sitting together in a hut with a translator, the three of us hunched over on little plastic stools. As Rajuma started sobbing, my forehead creased and I got angry at myself.

“Why am I putting her through this? Is anybody going to want to read something so awful? I don’t even want to write this story.”

I think I’m becoming the opposite of numb. Each tragedy I’ve covered, each loss I’ve absorbed, has rubbed away a little more of the insulation we all create, or were born with, that keeps the ills of the world safely away. After years of this work, I don’t have much insulation left. Now when I go off on assignment, I’m all nerves.

Even before I met Rajuma, I could barely keep it together. My first day in the refugee camps, watching Rohingya men try to remain dignified as they were herded into lines to wait for a pack of glucose biscuits, made my eyes sting.

I was shocked but soon learned that for decades the Rohingya have been walking around with bull’s-eyes on their foreheads. Scapegoated like the Jews in Nazi Germany, called insects like the Tutsis during Rwanda’s genocide, they are Muslim people in a Buddhist land, dehumanized by their own government and made easy prey.

So I started thinking: If we don’t cover this, that’s even worse. That would be a further injustice, a further insult to the Rohingya’s humanity. It would be like telling Rajuma that the world couldn’t be bothered about what she suffered.

It was very difficult to bring that interview to an end. As we parted ways, what was I supposed to say? In our culture we might say she should “see somebody.” But there were no psychotherapists around and I knew she was headed back to a plastic tarp held up by bamboo poles with nothing to do but think about those moments that I had asked her to conjure up.

I wanted to give her every dollar in my wallet. Or hug her. Or punch someone in the face. This is the worst part of being a journalist: feeling helpless. Not only is there nothing you can do about the horrors in front of you, but in most cases there’s only so much you should do. We are recorders, witnesses, not aid workers. Of course, if Rajuma were bleeding in front of me and needed my help, I wouldn’t hesitate to give it. But that wasn’t the situation here; her baby was dead and she would be traumatized forever.

I stood up and lamely shook her hand and said the only thing that felt close to right:

“Ami dukkhito.”

Of the few Bengali words I learned, those were the ones I used the most. I said them to dozens of Rohingya who lost everything.

Sometimes, it’s the only thing to say.

“The issue of self-defense will certainly continue as long as the fight against ISIS continues,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “But what goes on after that with the political process, I don’t know.”

Trump administration officials acknowledge privately that the military campaign in Syria has by far outstripped the diplomatic campaign, to the point now where there is no real plan for what to do in a post-Islamic State Syria.

A businessman who made his money from insurance, Mr. Banks is thought to have spent about $12 million in cash, loans and other support for Brexit causes. He was the primary supporter of Leave.EU, for which Mr. Farage campaigned.

The reports by Open Democracy, a liberal advocacy group, suggested that Mr. Banks, who had faced recent business setbacks, was considerably less wealthy than the $330 million he claimed, raising questions about how he was able to provide such large-scale financing for the Brexit cause.

The reports’ authors acknowledged, however, that Mr. Banks’s “present financial status” is “somewhat unclear” because of his complex network of ownership stakes in different companies.

Based on a separate report, Mr. Bradshaw also said that there had been “illegal donations” to the Democratic Unionist Party, a political party in Northern Ireland that campaigned for Brexit and is supporting the British government in key votes in Parliament.

Because of the reporting rules then in effect, the party did not have to divulge the sources of its funds. The campaign finance law has since been changed to add more transparency.

Responding to Mr. Bradshaw in Parliament, Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, described the issue as “incredibly important,” adding that “any specific information should always be raised with the Electoral Commission,” referring to the body that oversees Britain’s election rules.

Speaking later, Mr. Bradshaw said that he was “extremely concerned that there was Russian interference in our referendum in the same way that there was in the U.S. presidential election.” He added that he was worried that the issue was not being treated seriously enough by the British government.

Mr. Bradshaw, a former journalist and ex-minister in the Labour government of Tony Blair, previously raised concerns about financing in last year’s referendum, during which he argued for Britain to remain in the European Union.

In July in Parliament Mr. Bradshaw posed a similar question to Bridget Phillipson, a Labour lawmaker, who was representing the Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission. He asked whether she could “confirm — or, if not, ask the Electoral Commission — whether it has received allegations of illegal financial funding from Russia to elements of the leave campaign?”

Ms. Phillipson replied: “The commission is aware of media reports that allege that there could have been Russian involvement in the E.U. referendum. These cover a wide range of alleged activities that are beyond the commission’s remit.”

“Any allegation with evidence that a registered campaigner accepted impermissible donations from Russia would be investigated in line with the commission’s enforcement policy,” she added.

Rumors of Russian involvement in the Brexit campaign have been swirling for months, and Mr. Banks himself encouraged some speculation in his book on the referendum campaign, “The Bad Boys of Brexit.”

At one point, he describes attending a lunch at the London residence of the Russian ambassador, Alexander V. Yakovenko, in November 2015, in which he said he was invited to sample a rare vodka from a batch made for Stalin.

Mr. Banks has denied, however, that any Russian money was used in the Brexit referendum campaign.

On Thursday, he responded to the Open Democracy reports on Twitter with an attack on the organization, which he claimed was funded by “George Soros + rich foundations.”

He added, “As Churchill said, I’m obviously upsetting the right sort of people.”","Suspecting Russian Meddling in ‘Brexit’ Vote, Lawmaker Seeks Inquiry",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/world/europe/russia-brexit-arron-banks.html

Be aware of the situation you’re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you’re likely to pay the price.","Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains — unlike computers — are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.

On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack — all while we should be performing the actual jobs we’re paid to be doing.

“Many people seem unaware that they might accomplish more with sustained, uninterrupted attention to one task,” said Nelson Cowan, a working memory specialist at the University of Missouri. “It can be exhilarating to flit from one conversation to another on Facebook, but people don’t realize what’s missing in the process. It’s like having a delicious soup poured on your head. Often the people who think they’re the best at sharing attention between tasks are actually missing the most.”

Mr. LeDoux added: “The brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.”

They’re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.

Repeat After Me

As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks — reading, or saying words over and over — continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we’re already convinced we’re productive.

New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It’s the easiest brain game there is.

Take Your Time

Forget cramming. It didn’t work in college, it doesn’t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.

Robert Bjork, the chair of U.C.L.A.’s psychology department, said that quickly stuffing facts into our brains leads us to forget them in the long term (he even filmed a YouTube video series on the subject). When you rehearse knowledge and practice it often, it sticks, research has shown. So if you can incorporate what you’re trying to remember into daily life, ideally over time, your chances of retaining it drastically improve.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the “forgetting curve.”

To get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.

Sit Down and Stay Put

Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley’s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?

“The rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,” Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.

Multiple studies have found that procrastination leads to stress and downright kills focus. Stop engaging in useless tasks like surfing the web and just tackle whatever it is you need to work on. Then watch your focus soar and your memory improve. Dr. Cowan said both perform better when they aren’t cheating on each other pursuing so-called “life hacks.”

Incentivize Moments and Read Cues

Minds wander constantly. For students, adding frequent tests incentivizes focus because they know they’ll be quizzed. Harvard researchers report this approach decreases daydreaming by 50 percent, improving the result.

Daniel Schacter, a psychologist and a co-author of the Harvard study who also wrote “The Seven Sins Of Memory,” said the trick is focus. For some tasks, like online surfing, divided attention sounds harmless, but when we’re behind the wheel, it’s anything but. That forgetfulness can change the course of entire lives, the most serious vulnerability of memory, he added.

Mr. Schacter suggests employing cues — visual or verbal for items like keys — to associate places and things. And our electronic devices can help remind us, everything from mobile vaccination and immunization alerts to apps like Waze that can remind you that you left your baby in the car. It can sound silly, but it’s also tragic when we fail.

“Memory is very cue dependent,” he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. “Most say it could never happen to me, but it’s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don’t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.”

He added: “The really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.”

A simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you’re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.

“A lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,” Mr. Schacter said. “Doing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you’re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you’re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.”",Simple Ways to Be Better at Remembering,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/smarter-living/simple-ways-to-be-better-at-remembering.html

如果没在用手机，那你可能在用台式电脑或笔记本电脑，这意味着你的手指会不断触碰键盘。鉴于我们很多人会在桌旁吃零食或午餐，在电脑上方喝东西，甚至把饮料撒得到处都是，你可以想象那些按键底下存在着一个多脏的世界。

诚然，很多新闻标题都颇为耸动，说什么你的键盘比马桶座圈还脏（这其中存在一点儿误解，与卫生间里的其他表面相比，马桶座圈往往相当干净）；但如果不经常清理，键盘之类所谓的高接触频率表面，的确会成为有害细菌藏身和生长的温床。

好消息是，正如来自科技网站How-To Geek的这份极其详细的指南所阐述的，清洁键盘并不太难。如果进行深度清洁，拆掉键帽，把可能隐藏在下边的灰尘、污垢、头发和碎屑清理出来，你或许会震惊于那些按键底下竟然藏着那么多东西。

即便不这样做，你只要翻转键盘，把碎屑摇晃出来，再用小型手持真空吸尘器或罐装压缩空气处理一下，也可以达到很好的效果。然后用清洁纸巾、棉签或前文提到的以浓度为50%的异丙醇溶液润湿的超细纤维布，仔细清理你每天真正触碰的部分。

你的遥控器

请老实回答：一直以来你清理过遥控器吗？不论用的是普通的电视遥控器，还是更复杂的来自有线电视公司的那种，每当你倒在沙发上，大约都会拿起它调台，然后放松一下。但你擦拭按钮间的污垢和灰尘的频率绝对没有那么高，对吧？

污垢会越积越多，想想你在屏幕前吃过多少次零食就知道了。不论你偏爱爆米花、薯片还是更丰盛的餐食，你的遥控器都有可能变得很脏——同样，那些顽固的脏东西不大可能导致你生病，但肯定对你在工作一整天之后赖以放松的设备的使用寿命全无裨益。

实际上，遥控器非常脏，布满细菌，尤其是酒店房间里那些常常被不同的人轮番使用却从未被清理过的遥控。我们或许可以认定，下次旅行时你会用消毒清洁纸巾擦拭酒店里的遥控器，但为什么非要等到离家在外呢。请拿起一张纸巾，好好擦拭一下你每天都在使用的遥控器，并设法将其变成日常清洁工作的一部分。这么做或许不会让你变得更健康，却可以延长遥控器的使用寿命，这就够了。

你的枕头

你或许不知道，但大多数枕头都被设计成了可机洗产品。把枕头从洗衣机（或干洗机，如果生产商建议干洗的话）里拿出来的时候，你必须抖一抖它们，让它们变得蓬松；不要洗得太勤，以免变形。

洗枕头也是好习惯，因为枕头往往是死皮、灰尘、口水的聚居地，常常还有很多尘螨出没。对多数人来说，这没多大关系，除了晚上睡觉时他们的脸得和脏兮兮的枕头贴在一起。对免疫功能不全或有过敏症的人来说，就是麻烦事了，可能引发失眠，刺激皮肤，或造成鼻窦堵塞。

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common.
He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

PhotoIn an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well.","From grizzled cotton farmers to quiet small-town buildings and roadside stands, Walker Evans built his reputation on chronicling America’s out-of-the-way places and people. And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

That’s because their rankings included overseas teams who traveled to the United States to play in some of the preseason games.
And while the Thunder will be trying to contend for a title, the Knicks will be deploying a small army of big men.
Greatness, of course, is not something that will preoccupy the Knicks this season.","It is a lineup contrasted by the best team in the Eastern Conference, the Cleveland Cavaliers, who plan to start Kevin Love, normally a mobile power forward, at center. And many clubs are trying to emulate the Golden State Warriors’ brand of nearly positionless basketball.

“The game is changing,” D’Antoni said during his visit to New York. “The game has changed. Offense has changed in the last 10 years radically just because the players have gotten better, they shoot the ball better. Offense has opened up. The 3-point line — everybody shoots now. So offense has changed radically.”

It could for the Knicks, too, but it won’t happen immediately. They plan to start Porzingis and will probably have another big man on the court with him a good deal of the time. In that regard, the Knicks can choose from a list that includes the 6-foot-11 Enes Kanter, obtained in the trade that sent Anthony to Oklahoma City; the 6-11 Willy Hernangomez; the 6-10 Kyle O’Quinn; and the 6-11 Joakim Noah — when he returns from a drug suspension that will keep him out for the first 12 games of the season (he received a 20-game penalty but sat out eight games at the end of last season).

The Knicks also have Luke Kornet, a 7-foot-1 rookie out of Vanderbilt who is set to spend some of his time playing for their development-league team.

Last season, just nine teams had two big men — 6-foot-10 or taller — on the court at once for at least half the game, on average, according to the sports data company Stats LLC. And small-ball lineups outscored traditional ones by 1.2 points per 100 possessions last season, according to research done by the basketball analytics site Nylon Calculus.

The fact that the Knicks have so many big men at the moment is not really by design. Kanter was essentially acquired because his sizable contract helped balance out the money involved in the Anthony deal. Noah is in the second season of an expensive four-year contract that the Knicks’ revamped front office — with the new team president Steve Mills and new General Manager Scott Perry — would surely unload if it could.

On the other hand, Porzingis and Hernangomez are viewed as part of the future core of the team, but whether the Knicks can cope defensively with both of them on the court together in the current, high-octane N.B.A. is an intriguing question.

For now, what is clear is that Anthony is gone, Tim Hardaway Jr. has returned as an expensive free-agent swingman and a lot of tall people are on the roster. And one more thing: The Knicks, in the preseason, did not look good at all.

They went 0-5 in their exhibition games and their defense, which had been such a sore spot last season, looked even worse. The Knicks gave up 112.6 points per game and finished 32nd in defensive rating for the preseason.

Yes, 32nd in a 30-team league. That’s because their rankings included overseas teams who traveled to the United States to play in some of the preseason games. So the only teams with a worse defense than the Knicks this preseason turned out to be the Shanghai Sharks, Guangzhou Long-Lions, Sydney Kings and Maccabi Haifa.

In any case, the preseason is over. On Thursday night, the Knicks will open their regular season in Oklahoma City against none other than Anthony and his two renowned teammates — Paul George and Russell Westbrook. And while the Thunder will be trying to contend for a title, the Knicks will be deploying a small army of big men.

Which is fine with Kanter. “It’s good,” he said. “That means we’ve got an advantage. We can rebound better. We can protect the rim better. I think it’s going to work fine.”

If it does to any degree, it will be because Porzingis bears the burden of being the star of the team and absorbs being the target of opposing defenses and, just as important, stays healthy. He had a number of physical setbacks during his first two seasons and is already battling a hip injury that forced him to miss the preseason finale.

The Knicks also need 19-year-old Frank Ntilikina, their first-round draft pick out of France, to finally get healthy after missing all of the summer league and most of the preseason with knee injuries. He is a 6-foot-5 point guard with enormous potential, but he has yet to gain any real N.B.A. experience.

Meanwhile, the Knicks’ coach, Jeff Hornacek, maintains his club will be a transformed team from last season and will play with more pace. And perhaps a healthy Ntilikina and Hardaway and someone like the 6-foot-5 Courtney Lee can help make that happen. If nothing else, the Knicks are no longer obsessed by the triangle offense so beloved by Phil Jackson, the former team president.

Finally, there is this: On the first day of training camp, Hornacek assigned the team a book — “Chop Wood Carry Water: How to Fall in Love with the Process of Becoming Great.” He asked the players to read it and had them discuss different chapters each morning.

Greatness, of course, is not something that will preoccupy the Knicks this season. Progress is another matter, and how much takes place will be the primary issue. Who will be on the court is another.

That’s not simply because of his age and unthreatening youthful appearance, but because of the depth of his understanding of the power of a brand — an understanding shared by Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Macron. (See the official “behind-the-scenes” video of Mr. Macron arranging various heavily symbolic items on his desk before his official portrait.)

Mr. Kurz branded not only himself, but also his party. He changed its official color from black to turquoise and referred to it as the New People’s Party, the better to transform it from a familiar part of a coalition government to a “movement” (a word seemingly borrowed from Mr. Macron) shaped in his own image. During his election night rally, supporters wore turquoise jackets, shirts or sunglasses and carried turquoise balloons emblazoned with “Team Kurz.” It wasn’t the only thing he gave a specific look.

“Everything he does is styled to the last breath,” said Eugen Freund, a Social Democratic member of the European Parliament. “Not just on the fashion side. Everything is thought through: every movement of his hands, the way he gazes at people with a slight forward tilt of the head as if to indicate his attention. He does not leave anything to circumstance.”

It began very early. In 2009, not long after Mr. Kurz became leader of the youth wing of the party, he went on an image-ineering campaign, with the tag line “Black is hot,” featuring a picture of himself perched on the bonnet of a Hummer, in jeans, an untucked shirt and a come-hither look, surrounded by some equally satisfied-looking peers. It was broadly mocked, but it was also the beginning of a pattern.

Since becoming foreign minister in 2013 at age 27, Mr. Kurz has become known for his slim-line suits, a tendency to forgo ties (though he does wear them in debates and during state occasions), open collars and slicked-back hair. On his website, Kurz2017, not one of the multiple photographs of him staring soulfully out a window at the future, hard at work and talking to “real” men and women, features a tie. Occasionally he is shown in jeans and a pressed shirt, or a jacket, but never a T-shirt. His casual Friday look is not about a rejection of convention, but rather a noncontroversial loosening up.

“People can connect to it very easily,” Ms. Kritzinger said. “The ties symbolized the idea he was trying to do something different.” Though not, it should be said, different from Mr. Trudeau, who is also often tieless (or before him, President Barack Obama). Rather, it’s different from his older colleagues.

“It’s very unlike what you usually see,” Mr. Freund said, noting that ties have always been de rigueur in political dress in Austria, a country that hews closely to tradition and formality. “It makes a statement. And the collars are very specific: shark collars, never a button-down, the two ends spread wide apart.”

Mr. Kurz also flies economy class, works at a standing desk, likes to tweet (he has 253,000 followers) and, like Mr. Trudeau, will engage in selfies with fans for hours. Also like Mr. Trudeau, sports are a key part of his image: His website has videos of him biking, playing tennis and solo climbing a mountain under the stars, only to arrive at the metal cross on the summit as dawn breaks over the Alpine vista.

Subtle it isn’t.

Pointedly, the selfie thing, as well as the slightly hipster suits, were also hallmarks of his rivals, but none of them got quite the same credit for it. Indeed, the current chancellor, Christian Kern, was occasionally criticized as a “slim-fit chancellor” thanks to his suits. Yet Mr. Kurz wears pretty much the same style with impunity, perhaps because, thanks to his age, it seems authentically chosen, as opposed to adopted out of political calculus.

The truth of that is debatable, but it’s the appearance that counted. Which is the point.

Indeed, Gernot Bauer, the national desk editor at the Austrian newsmagazine Profil, told NPR that Mr. Kurz was like Justin Bieber. On Twitter, a fan compared the new chancellor to James Bond. (His critics use “mini-dictator” and even “Baby Hitler.”)

All of which underscored the message that Mr. Kurz represented something new. That the newness seems to be in fact a swing to the right, and may involve a coalition with the far right populist Freedom Party, has been made palatable by the artful way Mr. Kurz used his image to make the medicine go down.

Turkey saw the United States decision to arm military units affiliated with the Democratic Union Party as disregarding its concern for its national security.","In the 2000s Turkey took crucial steps to improve its democracy and economy that brought it close to European Union membership. The “Turkish Model” was widely praised as the way forward for Muslim countries aspiring for reform. The United States was constructively engaged in this process and saw Turkey as a critical pillar of the international liberal order. This policy ran through the Clinton, George W. Bush and a good part of the Obama administrations.

However, the United States-Turkey relationship has a history of ups and downs. After the Turkish intervention in Cyprus in 1974, the United States imposed an arms embargo on Turkey. It took five years to repair the relationship. In 2003, Turkey did not allow American troops to pass through Turkey to Iraq to open a northern front against Saddam Hussein — Turkey did not “approve” of a United States invasion of Iraq. That disagreement brought relations to another low.

The current crisis follows several intense spats pushing both sides deeper into a spiral of mutual distrust. These ranged from President Barack Obama’s deep disappointment with Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s crackdown on the Gezi Park protests in June 2013 to Turkish resentment of the Obama administration’s failure to support its “red lines” against the Assad regime in Syria’s civil war.

Disagreements over Syria widened when Turkey was accused of failure to stop the flow of foreign extremist fighters and the United States deepened military cooperation with the Syrian-Kurdish Democratic Union Party against the Islamic State. Turkey considers the Democratic Union Party an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party that has been conducting an insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s.

Turkish hope that bilateral relations would improve with the arrival of the Trump administration dissipated after violent clashes outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in Washington in May between President Erdogan’s bodyguards and protesters.

The July 2016 coup attempt against the Turkish government and its traumatic aftermath compound the current crisis. In Turkey, there is a strong consensus that Fethullah Gulen, the Islamic preacher based in Pennsylvania, and his movement planned and perpetrated the coup after their alliance with the government collapsed.

The continuous imposition of a state of emergency since the coup attempt and the widespread purge and detentions are difficult to reconcile with the rule of law. The growing practice of detaining foreigners and holding them as “bargaining chips” to pressure foreign governments into handing over Turkish citizens accused of involvement in the coup plot only confirms Turkey’s repressive and authoritarian image.

The United States also shares blame in the crisis. American failure to empathize with what Turkey went through during the coup attempt has damaged the relationship, even fed accusations of United States complicity. Turkey saw the United States decision to arm military units affiliated with the Democratic Union Party as disregarding its concern for its national security.

Turks are worried that weapons provided to Kurdish military units by the Americans would eventually be turned against them. Reassurances about monitoring these weapons through their serial numbers were unconvincing and helped whip up anti-American sentiment in Turkey.

The persistent absence of a United States foreign policy vision and strategy on the situation in Iraq and Syria is raising concerns in Turkey about the wisdom of relying on Washington. Turkey has immense economic and political stakes in greater stability in the Middle East and expects more effective engagement from the United States. Both sides still need each other.

Turkey could help the United States manage Russian and Iranian resurgence, fix the unresolved conflicts in the southern Caucasus, assist in the fight against Islamic State and contribute to find a modicum of stability in Iraq and Syria. But the absence of a clear United States strategy is pushing Turkey into a closer relationship with both Russia and Iran to defend its interests.

Despite its tensions with the United States and Europe, Turkey remains deeply integrated with the West and it is where the Turkish interests lie. More than half of its trade and two-thirds of its sorely needed foreign direct investment come from the European Union and the United States. Unlike Iran and Russia, Turkey is not an oil and natural gas exporter; its economic health is tied to a functioning market economy. Such an economy depends on stability, rule of law and stable markets in both the West and the Middle East.

American and Turkish diplomats need to resolve this crisis so that ordinary people can travel. A new diplomatic engagement can provide the space for the United States to reiterate the unacceptability of the erosion of the rule of law and any suggestions of detaining foreigners in Turkey as bargaining chips.

The United States could be more open to efforts — through the so-called track two diplomacy by influential figures outside government — to understand better the damage the Gulenists inflicted on Turkish institutions and politics.

Further, the United States needs to assure Turkey that the weapons delivered to the Kurds of the Democratic Union Party are not turned against Turkish targets. For their part, Turkish leaders need to avoid populist politics, lift the emergency state rule and focus on rebuilding democracy in Turkey.",How to Fix U.S.-Turkey Relations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/how-to-fix-us-turkey-relations.html

Last spring, she had the T-cell treatment at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.","The treatment was originally developed at the National Cancer Institute, by a team Dr. Steven Rosenberg led. The institute entered an agreement with Kite in 2012, in which the company helped pay for research and received rights to commercialize the results.

Largely on the strength of the new treatment and related research, the drug giant Gilead purchased Kite in August, for $11.9 billion.

“Today marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, said in a statement. “In just several decades, gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer.”

Side effects can be life-threatening, however. They include high fevers, crashing blood pressure, lung congestion and neurological problems. In some cases, patients have required treatment in an intensive care unit. In the study that led to the approval, two patients died from side effects. Doctors have learned to manage them better, but it takes training and experience.

Partly for that reason, Yescarta, like Kymriah, will be introduced gradually, and will be available only at centers where doctors and nurses have been trained in using it.

“Ten to 15 authorized institutions will be ready to go at the time of the launch,” a spokeswoman for Kite, Christine Cassiano, said. “In 12 months, we expect to have 70 to 90. There’s a lot that goes into it, making sure each institution is ready to go.”

Companies have been racing to develop new forms of immunotherapy. The first cell-based cancer treatment — Kymriah, made by Novartis — was approved in August for children and young adults with an aggressive type of acute leukemia. It will cost $475,000, but the company has said it will not charge patients who do not respond within the first month after treatment. Novartis is expected to ask the F.D.A. to approve Kymriah for lymphoma and other blood cancers as well, and may vary its price depending on how well it works for those diseases.

Kite also plans to seek approval for other blood cancers, but does not plan to vary Yescarta’s price, said Ms. Cassiano.

The company also hopes that Yescarta will eventually be approved for earlier stages of lymphoma, rather than being limited to patients with advanced disease who have been debilitated by multiple types of chemotherapy that did not work, said Dr. David D. Chang, Kite’s chief medical officer and executive vice president for research and development.

He said the F.D.A. had “embraced” the concept of cell therapy, designating it a breakthrough and accelerating the approval process to speed its availability to cancer patients, many of whom do not have time to wait.

Kite and Novartis also hope to produce cell therapies for so-called solid tumors — like those of the lung, prostate, breast and colon — which account for about 90 percent of all deaths from cancer.

Before it was approved and named Yescarta, Kite’s treatment was known by other names: axi-cel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or KTE-C19.

The study that led to approval enrolled 111 patients at 22 hospitals; 101 of them received Yescarta. They had one of three diseases: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma or transformed follicular lymphoma.

Initially, 54 percent had complete remissions, meaning that their tumors disappeared. Another 28 percent had partial remissions, in which tumors shrank or appeared less active on scans. After six months, 80 percent of the 101 were still alive.

With a median follow-up of 8.7 months, 39 percent of the 101 were still in complete remission — a much higher rate than achieved with earlier treatments — and 5 percent still had partial remissions.

“Many patients were seriously contemplating their own mortality,” said Dr. Caron A. Jacobson, who helped conduct the study at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center in Boston. “We would be talking to them about other clinical trials, but also about hospice care and quality of life and comfort. You’re really seeing people get their life back. After a couple weeks in the hospital and a couple weeks at home, they go back to work. On its face, it’s quite remarkable and revolutionary.”

The treatment requires removing millions of a patient’s T-cells — a type of white blood cell that is critical to the immune system — freezing them and shipping them to Kite to be genetically engineered to kill cancer cells. The process reprograms the T-cells to attack B-cells, normal parts of the immune system that turn malignant in certain blood cancers. The revved-up T-cells — now known as “CAR-T cells” — are then frozen again and shipped back to the hospital to be dripped into the patient. The turnaround time is about 17 days.

Kite’s cell-processing facility, in El Segundo, Calif., can provide the treatment for 4,000 to 5,000 patients a year, Ms. Cassiano said, adding that the company has applied for approval in Europe, and if it is granted, will probably build a plant there.

Tina Bureau, a fifth-grade teacher from Queensbury, N.Y., was one of the lymphoma patients in the study. Previously, she’d had several types of chemotherapy.

“The cancer would shrink but then it would come right back,” she said.

Last spring, she had the T-cell treatment at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The side effects were ferocious.

“You don’t even recognize your family members,” Ms. Bureau said. “I had some bleeding on my brain, and had to be put in intensive care. The week it was happening, I don’t remember a lot. It was much more difficult for my family than me.”

Within a month, she had a complete remission, which has continued. She is back at work, full time.

“Yes, it can pose life-threatening problems,” Ms. Bureau said. “But when you’re in a situation where your life’s threatened anyway, I don’t feel you have anything to lose.”",F.D.A.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — The Emmy-award winning actor John Lithgow does not have a favorite word, he says, because he loves too many of them to narrow the choice down to a single one. When pressed, he comes up with “eldritch,” an intriguing word that means sinister and eerie, and which seems to have made a kind of comeback in the 20th century. It is exactly the type of word that a logophile like Mr. Lithgow might like, and he savors it as it leaves his lips.

Wordplay Words, Words, Words Audio

Mr. Lithgow himself is anything but eldritch, despite his dazzling and dark portrayal of the serial killer Arthur Mitchell on the Showtime series “Dexter,” for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

As part of the 75th anniversary of The New York Times Crossword, our editor Will Shortz is running a series of crossword collaborations between people of note and popular Times constructors, and today it is Mr. Lithgow’s turn to make a different kind of debut. Rather than walk onto the stage of a theater, step onto a television or film set, or put pen to paper to write one of his books for children, Mr. Lithgow scaled a very steep learning curve with Mr. Quigley, and the result is an entertaining puzzle that definitely has his signature on it.

The language of the new document is more cagey. But the sentiments are chilling.

The report “conflates black political activists with dangerous domestic terrorist organizations that pose actual threats to law enforcement,” the Congressional Black Caucus said in a letter asking for a meeting with the F.B.I.

“It relies on a handful of obviously terrible incidents to paint black Americans who exercise free speech against witnessed police brutality as possible violent extremists,” the letter said. (It was referring to six cases since 2014 in which the F.B.I. said the black identity menace was behind attacks on police officers, including the reprehensible shooting of 11 police officers, five of whom died, in Dallas on July 7, 2016.)

The F.B.I. draws a line from the killing by a police officer of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014 to all those other cases and warns of a “surge” in ideologically motivated violence against the police.

The report also draws a line from the activists of the ’60s and ’70s to the “extremists” of today. The black threat, it said, had simply been dormant.

There is no such connection. The F.B.I. failed even to make any real connection among the six incidents it cited.

The authors of the report act as though there is doubt about the institutional racism in our country and in some police forces. (I am not saying all white police officers are racists.)

The F.B.I. document talked about “perceived injustices against African-Americans” — perceived by anyone who is really paying attention.

The counterterrorism division said it “considered” the possibility that violence against the police is not driven by their phantom B.I.E.s but decided that was “very unlikely.”

Fifty years ago, Hoover’s F.B.I. spied on civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. It forged letters to create friction between rival black-power movements, which led to a shooting at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1969 that left two dead. Undercover police officers were responsible for framing 21 Black Panthers for a fake bombing conspiracy in New York in 1969.

The list goes on and on.

Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology.
Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.
But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply.
Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused.","“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he recalled, saying he wrote them off as mild misbehavior. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

In the hourlong conversation, Mr. Tarantino, 54, apologized for not doing more while also explaining why; admitted his own culpability while also calling for sweeping change in Hollywood’s treatment of women; and condemned Mr. Weinstein, 65, while acknowledging their father-son closeness.

The producer and director have been symbiotic for decades: from 1992, when Mr. Weinstein distributed “Reservoir Dogs,” through “Pulp Fiction,” the “Kill Bill” films, “Inglourious Basterds” and “The Hateful Eight,” until a few weeks ago, when he threw Mr. Tarantino an engagement party.

When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said. But some of the accounts were deeply familiar to him. “Everyone who was close to Harvey had heard of at least one of those incidents” chronicled in the first few articles, he said. “It was impossible they didn’t.”

The Weinstein Investigation

When he and Ms. Sorvino started dating in 1995, she told him that not long before, Mr. Weinstein had massaged her without asking, chased her around a hotel room and even showed up at her apartment in the middle of the night, a story she recently shared with The New Yorker.

“I was shocked and appalled” back then, Mr. Tarantino said. “I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira.” She had won accolades for her performance in “Mighty Aphrodite,” and “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way,” Mr. Tarantino said. “Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

The problem was resolved, he said he felt at the time, because he and Ms. Sorvino were dating. “I’m with her, he knows that, he won’t mess with her, he knows that she’s my girlfriend,” Mr. Tarantino said, describing his attitude back then.

Over the years, he learned of other accounts. Another actress friend told him a troubling story of unwanted advances by Mr. Weinstein in a hotel room. Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology. (She confirmed the account to The Times but declined to be identified.)

Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. Recently, she tweeted that Mr. Weinstein had raped her.

Mr. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex made by Ms. McGowan and others.

There were rumors too, shadowy accounts that Mr. Tarantino continued to hear second- or thirdhand and never pursued further. Now Mr. Tarantino said he regretted not taking the women’s stories seriously enough. “I chalked it up to a ’50s-’60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s O.K. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

In the interview, Mr. Tarantino issued several calls to action. In its treatment of women, Hollywood has been “operating under an almost Jim Crow-like system that us males have almost tolerated,” he said. “We allowed it to exist because that’s the way it was.”

On the discussion of who knew what about Mr. Weinstein and when, he said: “I’m calling on the other guys who knew more to not be scared. Don’t just give out statements. Acknowledge that there was something rotten in Denmark. Vow to do better by our sisters.”

He added, “What was previously accepted is now untenable to anyone of a certain consciousness.”

His own relationship with Mr. Weinstein, who has been fired from his own company and ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, spanned deals and shoots, publicity tours and film festivals. But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply. Mr. Weinstein needs to “face the music,” he said.

Despite their closeness, he said he could offer no insight into Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misdeeds. “I don’t have an answer for why he could do this and be stripped of his entire legacy,” he said.

Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused. “I don’t know,” he said. “I hope it doesn’t.”",Tarantino on Weinstein: ‘I Knew Enough to Do More Than I Did’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html

But for Mr. Nikolaou, the project, called “…Balkaniotheque” and sponsored by the Onassis Foundation, became more than a multifaceted look at the region. It has been a search for his very identity.

“I am a Greek,” said Mr. Nikolaou, who calls both Athens and Chalkis home. “And I have multiple identities. I belong in the East, in the West, but I also belong in the Balkans. This was forgotten for Greeks. None define themselves as Balkan. I had to find myself.”

Early on, Mr. Nikolaou said the project felt like psychoanalysis, a dive into his soul and the way he learned how to feel. He became fixated on the notion of a shared, repressed Balkan identity, one that he could unearth and restore to the collective memory.

“I wish to describe the Balkan soul,” he said. “Which seems to be dark and intractable, but it becomes simple, warm and human when it flames up.”

Mr. Nikolaou said he allowed the places to which he journeyed to choose him, not the other way around. In his travels, he’s been to nearly a dozen countries, exploring bustling capital cities as well as Roma ghettos and mountain villages.

“I made more than 20 trips trying not just to take photos, but to feel the Balkan reality,” he said. “To see those deep characteristics of the Balkan people that I believe are common all over the peninsula.”

The Balkan people were very hospitable, Mr. Nikolaou said, though he preferred to stay in the remote, rural areas. “There I met the most important people,” he said. “People totally free from the stress of our civilization. People with pain in their eyes but firstly, with big, big heart.”

He bore witness to funerals, celebrated at weddings and made intimate connections with those who opened their homes and lives to him. That vulnerability fostered a sense of human unity that Mr. Nikolaou hopes to showcase.

“The Balkans are a place where people look so different, but they are so alike in the way they face life,” he said. “And that must be what will lead us in the future. It may seem utopian, but deep inside me I believe that all people can live without borders. Even in the war-crushed Balkans, we can. It is enough to look at what it is that unites us. And what unites us is more important than what keeps us divided.”

One reason may be that in recent years U.S. democracy has become appallingly dysfunctional.
We are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism.","As Sasha Polakow-Suransky, the author of “Go Back to Where You Came From: The Backlash Against Immigration and the Fate of Western Democracy,” warns in The New York Review of Books:

Liberal democracies are better equipped than authoritarian states to grapple with the inevitable conflicts that arise in diverse societies, including the threat of terrorist violence. But they also contain the seeds of their own destruction: if they fail to deal with these challenges and allow xenophobic populists to hijack the public debate, then the votes of frustrated and disaffected citizens will increasingly go to the anti-immigrant right, societies will become less open, nativist parties will grow more powerful, and racist rhetoric that promotes a narrow and exclusionary sense of national identity will be legitimized.

The threat to democracy posed by the current outbreak of populist nationalism has become a matter of concern for both scholars and ordinary citizens. The central topic at a conference at Yale earlier this month was “How Do Democracies Fall Apart,” and the subject will be taken up again in November at a Stanford conference called “Global Populisms: A Threat to Democracy?”

I contacted several of the participants at the Yale gathering and was struck by their anxiety over the future prospects of democratic governance.

One of the most insightful was Adam Przeworski, a political scientist at N.Y.U., who has written, but not yet published, his own analysis of current events under the title “What’s Happening.”

First and foremost, Przeworski stresses,

there is nothing ""undemocratic"" about the electoral victory of Donald Trump or the rise of anti-establishment parties in Europe.

These parties and candidates, he points out:

Do not advocate replacing elections by some other way of selecting rulers. They are ugly — most people view racism and xenophobia as ugly — but these parties do campaign under the slogan of returning to ‘the people’ the power usurped by elites, which they see as strengthening democracy. In the words of a Trump advertisement, “Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people.”

In support of Przeworski’s argument, it is clear that the success of the Trump campaign in winning the Republican nomination was the result of a classic democratic insurgency: the Republican electorate’s rejection of its party’s establishment.

The danger in the United States, in Przeworski’s view, is the possibility that the Trump administration will use the power of the presidency to undermine the procedures and institutions essential to the operation of democracy:

That the incumbent administration would intimidate hostile media and create a propaganda machine of its own, that it would politicize the security agencies, that it would harass political opponents, that it would use state power to reward sympathetic private firms, that it would selectively enforce laws, that it would provoke foreign conflicts to monger fear, that it would rig elections.

Przeworski believes that

such a scenario would not be unprecedented. The United States has a long history of waves of political repression: the “Red Scare” of 1917-20, the internment of Japanese citizens during World War II, the McCarthy period, the Nixon presidency.

Along similar lines, Anna Grzymala-Busse, a political scientist at Stanford, replied by email to my inquiry:

My big worry is not simply that formal institutions have been eroded, but that the informal norms that underpin them are even more important and even more fragile. Norms of transparency, conflict of interest, civil discourse, respect for the opposition and freedom of the press, and equal treatment of citizens are all consistently undermined, and without these the formal institutions become brittle.

Trump, in Grzymala-Busse’s assessment, “articulates a classic populist message that we see in Europe: the elite establishment is a collusive cartel uninterested in the problems of ‘the people,’” and, she continued, he has begun to follow the path of European populist leaders:

Much of Trump’s language and actions are also familiar: there is a standard authoritarian populist template, developed in Hungary and faithfully followed in Poland and in Turkey: first, go after the courts, then the media, then the civil society, churches, universities.

The attacks on the courts, media and universities

are not simply the ravings of a lunatic, but an established strategy for undermining democratic oversight and discrediting the opposition.

Margaret Levi, another political scientist at Stanford, wrote me that she was

not sure Trumpism per se will survive Trump. But I do think it is the current embodiment of a right-wing populism that is likely to remain the basis of internal opposition within the Republican Party or be the basis of a split in the Party, leading to two new parties.

Some form of right-wing populism, Levi argued,

is already a competitive force in general elections. And it is once again a force in competitive elections in democracies world-wide.

She added that there was no guarantee that right-wing populism “will not transform into the fascist and Nazi forms.”

Unless the Democratic Party in this country and moderate parties in the rest of the world “find a way to address the populace’s underlying economic insecurity and deterioration in the perceived (and actual in many cases) standard of living, the possibility for irreparable damage does exist,” Levi wrote:

Otherwise, both confidence in democratic government, measured by the extent it is a reliable provider of needed goods and services, including domestic and international security, and its legitimacy, the normative belief in its right to rule, will decline significantly and dangerously — perhaps even to the point of no return.

While white identitarianism, anger over immigration and economic dislocation are often cited as causes of the emergence of right-wing populism, another argument is that there is a growing segment of the electorate that is alienated from cultural norms they see as imposed on them by a ruling elite — a repressive elite; politically correct and socially remote.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In a research paper published in the current issue of the Journal of Democracy, “Eroding Norms and Democratic Deconsolidation,” Paul Howe, a political scientist at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, describes the increasing size of the nihilistic segment of the American electorate.

This constituency of the disengaged and profoundly alienated provides a base of support in the United States and Europe for populist leaders who, in Howe’s view, fit the Trump mold:

They compete in the democratic process, yet with words and actions that convey disregard for core democratic principles such as the rule of law, minority rights, and checks and balances on executive power. At the same time, a number of these individuals are prone to brazen, dubious, and sometimes aggressive behaviors that suggest outsized egos, scant respect for others, and a degree of contempt for social norms.

Looking at data from World Values Surveys in recent decades, Howe finds that in the United States,

the rise of antidemocratic sentiment has less to do with dysfunction in the political arena than with corrosive changes that have reshaped the social and cultural landscape more generally.

These corrosive changes include an increase in the number of citizens who say it is O.K. to

claim government benefits to which one is not entitled; take a bribe in the course of one’s duties; cheat on taxes; and avoid a public-transit fare.

When answers to these questions were correlated with political attitudes, Howe found that

indifferent feelings toward democracy are interlaced with a broader set of self-interested and antisocial attitudes that are present among a substantial minority of the U.S. population.

He then argues that the

broader constellation of transgressive and antisocial attitudes among a subsection of the public is an important force behind rising disregard for democratic norms.

Clearly, a sense of isolation, actual isolation, the breakdown of the family, the rise of opiates, the disappearance of associations, a nation “bowling alone” and “coming apart,” have all played a role in creating an antisocial constituency. This very constituency has produced some of the strongest Trump supporters and backing for the so-called alt-right. As Howe writes:

Those with a high-school education or less are substantially more likely than those with a college degree to express skeptical views about democracy as well as tolerance of various antisocial behaviors, by variances that range from 5 to 30 percentage points across the questions.

Few people have looked at these issues as long and as hard as Ron Inglehart, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. In “The Danger of Deconsolidation: How Much Should We Worry?” (published alongside the Foa-Mounk essay in the July 2016 issue of the Journal of Democracy) Inglehart raises this question:

What makes the United States so distinctive? One reason may be that in recent years U.S. democracy has become appallingly dysfunctional. It suffers from 1) virtual paralysis at the top, as exemplified by the willingness of Congress to shut down the federal government, regardless of the damage to the country’s credit, after failing to get its way via normal procedures in a budget standoff with the White House; 2) massive increases in income inequality — greater than those found in any other established democracy, with most of the population’s real income declining during the past few decades despite substantial economic growth; and 3) the disproportionate and growing political influence of billionaires, as money plays a greater role in U.S. politics than in almost any other democracy.

The economic boom in the post-World War II years “produced rising security and an intergenerational shift toward self-expression values,” Inglehart wrote, but “in recent decades most advanced industrial societies have experienced economic stagnation, rising unemployment coupled with massive immigration, and the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.”

The resulting “high levels of existential insecurity,” Inglehart argues,

are conducive to authoritarianism, xenophobia, and rejection of new cultural norms. The economic stagnation and rising inequality of recent decades have led to increasing support for authoritarian, xenophobic political candidates, from Marine le Pen in France to Donald Trump in the United States.

While the contemporary explosion of right-wing populism is a recent phenomenon, its roots go deeper, best captured by Daniel Bell in his 1972 essay “The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism” which foreshadowed the Trump era.

American capitalism, Bell wrote,

has lost its traditional legitimacy which was based on a moral system of reward, rooted in a Protestant sanctification of work. It has substituted in its place a hedonism which promises a material ease and luxury, yet shies away from all the historic implications which a “voluptuary system” — and all its social permissiveness and libertinism — implies.

The conflict between “the principles of economics and economizing” and a culture “rooted in a return to instinctual modes” has produced a “disjunction which is the historic crisis of Western society. This cultural contradiction, in the long run, is the deepest challenge to the society.”

For the moment, the Republican Party has become the main battleground for the struggle over authoritarianism, xenophobia and the erosion of received standards.

At the Yale conference, Daniel Ziblatt, a professor of government at Harvard, warned that Trump and other right-wing leaders have breached traditional political boundaries that serve as “the soft guardrails of democracy.” The two “master norms,” in Ziblatt’s view, are mutual toleration, that is, the acceptance of “the basic legitimacy of our opponents,” and institutional forbearance — the responsible exercise of power by those in office.

Both his detractors and his supporters recognize that Trump has flouted countless rules — and revels in doing so. On Monday, Senator John McCain, awarded the Liberty Medal by the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, challenged Trump on this score:

To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain “the last best hope of earth” for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.

Mounk and Ziblatt, writing for Vox in March of 2016, made the case that “Trump isn’t a fascist; he’s a demagogue.” Their conclusion, however, was that Trump’s demagoguery does not make him any “less dangerous.” Instead, Trump and politicians like him are “a profound threat to the survival of democratic politics.”

Politicians in the Trump mold

wreck the informal rules of civility that democracies require to survive. Once voters are activated along violent lines and fervently believe the myths propagated by the demagogue, the dam is broken; the ordinary rules of democratic politics no longer apply, and there is no telling what might come next.

Timothy Snyder, a historian at Yale and the author of “Bloodlands” and “Black Earth” (and also a contributor to these pages) was a participant at the conference in New Haven. He introduces his most recent book, “On Tyranny,” this way:

The Founding Fathers tried to protect us from the threat they knew, the tyranny that overcame ancient democracy. Today, our political order faces new threats, not unlike the totalitarianism of the twentieth century. We are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so.

Writing in 2012, well before the advent of Trump, three economists, Luigi Guiso, Helios Herrera and Massimo Morelli, argued that the populist political tradition itself is based first on “promises of redistribution to the masses” and second on “concealment of government budget constraints from the voters.” Promising redistribution to the masses and concealing government budget constraints was the essence of Trump’s campaign strategy, as he promised to build a multibillion dollar wall “which Mexico will pay for”; to repeal Obamacare and replace it with “health care which will expand choice, increase access, lower costs & provide better care”; to preserve Medicare; and to enact a gigantic tax cut for the middle class. So far, Trump has failed to fulfill any of these promises, boxed in by the reality of “government budget constraints.”

Paul Waldman, writing in The Washington Post on Oct, 17, summed up Trump’s approach to veracity and to reality itself:

Trump takes his own particular combination of ignorance, bluster and malice, and sets it off like a nuclear bomb of misinformation. The fallout spreads throughout the country, and no volume of corrections and fact checks can stop it. It wasn’t even part of a thought-out strategy, just a loathsome impulse that found its way out of the president’s mouth to spread far and wide.

Trump’s recklessness is disturbing enough on its own. But what makes it especially threatening is that much of the public — well beyond the 40 percent of the electorate that has shown itself to be unshakable in its devotion to the president — seems to be slowly accommodating itself to its daily dose of the Trump reality show, accepting the rhetorical violence that Trump inflicts on basic standards of truth as the new normal.",Democracy Can Plant the Seeds of Its Own Destruction,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/democracy-populism-trump.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming.

The incidence of mouth and throat cancers caused by the human papillomavirus in men has now surpassed the incidence of HPV-related cervical cancers in women, researchers report.

The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that 11 million men and 3.2 million women in the United States had oral HPV infections. Among them, 7 million men and 1.4 million women had strains that can cause cancers of the throat, tongue and other areas of the head and neck.

The risk of infection was higher for smokers, for people who have had multiple sex partners, and for men who have sex with men. Frequent oral sex also increased the risk. The rate was higher among men who also had genital HPV. (Almost half of men aged 18 to 60 have a genital HPV infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

Neither age nor income made a difference in high-risk oral infection rates, but rates among non-Hispanic blacks were higher than other races and ethnicities.

HPV vaccination is recommended starting at age 11 or 12 and is effective, said the senior author, Ashish A. Deshmukh, an assistant professor at the University of Florida, and “it’s crucial that parents vaccinate boys as well as girls.”

The lead author, Kalyani Sonawane, also at the University of Florida, said that behavioral change is important, too, particularly smoking cessation. “The difference in oral HPV infection between smokers and nonsmokers is staggering,” she said.",7 Million American Men Carry Cancer-Causing HPV,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/well/live/7-million-american-men-carry-cancer-causing-hpv-virus.html

The Nuevo Amanecer Mariachi Academy is one of those places where the traditions of Mexico are passed onto new generations. Students between the ages of 6 and 20 meet in a church basement in East Elmhurst, Queens, to learn violin, trumpet or guitar, while more experienced students rehearse for gigs in local restaurants and churches.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

Stop me if you’ve heard this one. The members of an upstanding, upper-middle-class nuclear family are terrorized by a malign force. Their suffering is not entirely arbitrary, because not all of them are completely innocent. (Usually it’s Daddy’s fault.) Their tormentor metes out a cruel and disproportionate kind of justice, and revels in the punishment. Meanwhile, the audience squirms in complicity, taking both masochistic and sadistic pleasure at a game of cat and mouse in which the roles keep shifting.

I’ll stop now. It isn’t quite fair to say, with respect to Yorgos Lanthimos’s “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” that you’ve seen it all before. His methods and sensibility are very much his own. But if you were intrigued, unnerved and tickled by “The Lobster” or by Mr. Lanthimos’s earlier films “Alps” and “Dogtooth” (I was), you might be surprised and a little disappointed to find him traipsing over such familiar territory. His previous work — allegorical, satirical, anti-realist and metapsychological — defies genre labels and can seem scrubbed clean of any trace of influence. “Sacred Deer,” in contrast, rings all kinds of frequently-heard bells.

Video

The premise might remind you of any version of “Cape Fear” (except maybe the one from “The Simpsons”) or countless horror movies. Mr. Lanthimos’s techniques — a hovering, prying camera, an atmosphere of chilly, cerebral detachment — owe a debt to the films of Michael Haneke, in particular those like “Cache” and “Funny Games” that subject the guilty conscience of the bourgeoisie to painful deep-tissue massage. But Mr. Lanthimos is less interested in moral shock therapy or social criticism than in aesthetic estrangement. “Sacred Deer” feels like a dark, opaque bit of folklore transplanted into an off-kilter modern setting.

Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a respected heart surgeon. His wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman), is an equally successful eye doctor. They live with their two children — Kim (Raffey Cassidy), a wide-eyed teenage girl, and her younger brother, Bob (Sunny Suljic) — in a big house in an unspecified, apparently American city. (The film was shot in Ireland and Cincinnati.) Steven also has a curious friendship with an odd, earnest young man named Martin (Barry Keoghan). The two of them have lunch and take walks together and exchange gifts, and the opening scenes invite the audience to guess at the nature of their relationship.

It’s made clear soon enough. Martin, who seems both a little slow and spookily intuitive, turns out to be the evil force who will torment the Murphys. Some years earlier, Steven had performed an operation on the boy’s father, who subsequently died. In lieu of filing a malpractice claim, Martin has chosen a more archaic — and, in the film’s modern setting, a far scarier and more preposterous — form of score settling. He demands that Steven kill Anna or one of their kids. If he doesn’t, the whole family will sicken and die. Martin describes the process in exacting detail, and then it begins.

Is this a curse? A superpower? As in Mr. Lanthimos’s other movies, no explanation is offered. No boundary is marked between the normal and the supernatural. The normal, in this filmmaker’s world, is pretty weird to begin with. All the characters speak in the same droning, matter-of-fact tone until they are provoked to violent rage. They ask puzzling questions and produce overelaborate answers, not so much like machines but like people doing their best to fail a Turing test.

Sometimes this is funny, and sometimes effectively scary. The auditory migraine of the sound design and the visual paranoia of the drone-mounted cameras help create an ambience of perpetual panic. You laugh to break the tension, and also you can’t help but intuit a comic intention under the cast’s deadpan.

Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused.","“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he recalled, saying he wrote them off as mild misbehavior. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

In the hourlong conversation, Mr. Tarantino, 54, apologized for not doing more while also explaining why; admitted his own culpability while also calling for sweeping change in Hollywood’s treatment of women; and condemned Mr. Weinstein, 65, while acknowledging their father-son closeness.

The producer and director have been symbiotic for decades: from 1992, when Mr. Weinstein distributed “Reservoir Dogs,” through “Pulp Fiction,” the “Kill Bill” films, “Inglourious Basterds” and “The Hateful Eight,” until a few weeks ago, when he threw Mr. Tarantino an engagement party.

When Mr. Tarantino read the articles about Mr. Weinstein, he was horrified by the scope and severity of the alleged abuse, especially the rape accusations, he said. But some of the accounts were deeply familiar to him. “Everyone who was close to Harvey had heard of at least one of those incidents” chronicled in the first few articles, he said. “It was impossible they didn’t.”

The Weinstein Investigation

When he and Ms. Sorvino started dating in 1995, she told him that not long before, Mr. Weinstein had massaged her without asking, chased her around a hotel room and even showed up at her apartment in the middle of the night, a story she recently shared with The New Yorker.

“I was shocked and appalled” back then, Mr. Tarantino said. “I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira.” She had won accolades for her performance in “Mighty Aphrodite,” and “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way,” Mr. Tarantino said. “Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The problem was resolved, he said he felt at the time, because he and Ms. Sorvino were dating. “I’m with her, he knows that, he won’t mess with her, he knows that she’s my girlfriend,” Mr. Tarantino said, describing his attitude back then.

Over the years, he learned of other accounts. Another actress friend told him a troubling story of unwanted advances by Mr. Weinstein in a hotel room. Mr. Tarantino confronted Mr. Weinstein, who offered the woman what the director described as a weak apology. (She confirmed the account to The Times but declined to be identified.)

Mr. Tarantino also knew that Ms. McGowan had reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. Recently, she tweeted that Mr. Weinstein had raped her.

Mr. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex made by Ms. McGowan and others.

There were rumors too, shadowy accounts that Mr. Tarantino continued to hear second- or thirdhand and never pursued further. Now Mr. Tarantino said he regretted not taking the women’s stories seriously enough. “I chalked it up to a ’50s-’60s era image of a boss chasing a secretary around the desk,” he said. “As if that’s O.K. That’s the egg on my face right now.”

In the interview, Mr. Tarantino issued several calls to action. In its treatment of women, Hollywood has been “operating under an almost Jim Crow-like system that us males have almost tolerated,” he said. “We allowed it to exist because that’s the way it was.”

On the discussion of who knew what about Mr. Weinstein and when, he said: “I’m calling on the other guys who knew more to not be scared. Don’t just give out statements. Acknowledge that there was something rotten in Denmark. Vow to do better by our sisters.”

He added, “What was previously accepted is now untenable to anyone of a certain consciousness.”

His own relationship with Mr. Weinstein, who has been fired from his own company and ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, spanned deals and shoots, publicity tours and film festivals. But when Mr. Tarantino tried to call Mr. Weinstein several times recently after the disclosures, he said, he got no reply. Mr. Weinstein needs to “face the music,” he said.

Despite their closeness, he said he could offer no insight into Mr. Weinstein’s alleged misdeeds. “I don’t have an answer for why he could do this and be stripped of his entire legacy,” he said.

Asked how the news about Mr. Weinstein would affect how the public views his own record and body of work, Mr. Tarantino paused. “I don’t know,” he said. “I hope it doesn’t.”",Tarantino on Weinstein: ‘I Knew Enough to Do More Than I Did’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus.

He jettisoned increased penalties for assault against utility workers and false advertising in pet sales.

He vetoed a campus sexual harassment bill that won large majorities in the statehouse, where Democrats dominate in both chambers.

“Depriving any student of higher education opportunities should not be done lightly,” Mr. Brown wrote in part, adding, “It is time to pause and survey the land.”

Thad Kousser, a political scientist at U.C. San Diego, said Mr. Brown essentially sees his role as steering California toward the political middle.

“This is a governor who relishes his role as the adult in the room,” Dr. Kousser said.

State lawmakers this year approved a measure directed at President Trump that would have compelled presidential candidates to release their tax returns, something Mr. Trump never did.

The governor rejected it.

“I recognize the political attractiveness — even the merits — of getting President Trump’s tax returns,” he wrote. But he worried, he added, about creating a “slippery slope.”

In at least one case, Mr. Brown appeared to channel his inner libertarian. He vetoed a bill that would have banned smoking at state beaches and parks.

“If people can’t even smoke on a deserted beach,” he asked, “where can they?”

“Krazy” George Henderson is a conductor not of music but of the masses.

His big moment came 36 years ago in front of a packed Oakland Coliseum during a playoff game between the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees.

It was this week in 1981 that Mr. Henderson led a crowd in the first televised audience wave.

He had gotten into leading cheers in the 1960s as a student at San Jose State University, where he was a rabid fan of the Spartans.

The hobby turned into a career after professional teams around the Bay Area began hiring him to whip their fans into a frenzy. The tools of his trade: cut-off jeans shorts, wild blonde hair, a handheld drum and boundless energy.

By the time he unveiled the wave for a national television audience, he had been perfecting it for years in smaller venues. The announcers at the coliseum marveled as fans stood up in turns, waving their arms at Mr. Henderson’s direction.

“It’s amazing,” one said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Washington State fans claimed they had been doing a wave even earlier, but Mr. Henderson’s was the first to be seen by the world.

The wave became a staple of sporting events and Mr. Henderson’s cheerleading career spanned four decades.

Now 73, he lives with his wife in Capitola by Monterey Bay.

Reached by phone, he said he’s only semi-retired. A couple weeks ago he went to San Jose State to lead cheers for his Spartans — free of charge.

With the team down by several touchdowns, he led the half-filled stadium in a wave.

“They don’t get to decide for you based on what you’re assigned at birth,” A. T. said. “Someone can go into a new job as nonbinary and have paperwork to back that up and there’s no way for the employer to know.”

The legislation has faced some resistance. One conservative group expressed concerns that the new law, which eliminates the need for a physician’s letter in support of a gender transition, could lead to identity fraud.

And the California Family Council said the inclusion of a third gender on state documents would create the need for nonbinary sports teams at public schools, at a great expense.

In an opinion article published in The San Diego Union-Tribune in July, the group’s president, Jonathan Keller, warned that if the law were enacted, “California’s nearly 150 public colleges and universities, and all 10,453 public schools would be required to provide not only male and female athletic teams and facilities but nonbinary ones as well,” to comply with the Title IX federal civil rights law.

But legal experts and supporters reject that claim.

“It’s a surprising argument to hear because it’s not as if the Department of Education is increasing its enforcement of Title IX as a protector of transgender civil rights,” Erin E. Buzuvis, a law professor at Western New England University, said in a phone interview. “The regulations are clearly written with the gender binary in mind.”

Kristine E. Newhall, an assistant professor of kinesiology at SUNY Cortland, agreed.

The N.C.A.A. doesn’t regulate gender identity for the purposes of being on a team, Dr. Newhall said. They use biological markers instead.

“It’s not how you identify in terms of your gender,” she said. “You can have that N on your license, and the N.C.A.A. doesn’t care about that.

Dove’s ad was not an isolated case by one company, but the latest in a long line of tone-deaf ads by many companies.

Here are a few examples from the past.

Intel, July 2007

A 2007 ad for Intel’s new processor showed a white man surrounded by six black sprinters bent over in starting poses. “Multiply computing performance and maximize the power of your employees,” the text read.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

“Visibly more beautiful skin,” the ad read.

Edelman, the public relations company representing Dove, said in a statement to Gawker: “All three women are intended to demonstrate the ‘after’ product benefit. We do not condone any activity or imagery that intentionally insults any audience.”

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

A representative of Nivea’s parent company, Beiersdorf, said it had “never intended to hurt anybody or to raise any wrong interpretation.”

But, like Dove, Nivea had offended before.

Six years earlier, after apologizing for an ad that showed a black man preparing to throw away his old Afro-wearing head behind the words “Re-civilize yourself,” it promised to review “current development and approval processes” in order to “avoid any kind of future misleading interpretations.”",Dove Drops an Ad Accused of Racism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

The title of this video explains what’s wriggling unseen inside the artist’s shirt, creating a comically — if powerfully — quasi-erotic ruckus. In another celebrated early video, she exchanges an onion, mouth to mouth, with each of her parents; tears ensue.

For this eagerly awaited exhibition, her largest to date, Ms. Chang (who was born in San Francisco and works in Los Angeles) has created an integrated, multidisciplinary installation of mostly new work that reframes her early investigations of identity and its straying boundaries. Engrossing and deeply moving, “The Wandering Lake 2009-2017,” at the Queens Museum, mostly shifts attention away from the artist’s body, relying on moving water as a metaphor for concerns ranging from gender fluidity and internet surfing to climate change and migration. Curated by Hitomi Iwasaki, the show touches on a child’s birth and a father’s death, as well as more global losses — of languages, cultures and even the geographical features that shape them. A running theme, sometimes elusive but potent nonetheless, is material and psychological instability, and meaning that spills the boundaries of individual works.

At the outset are two videos, each projected onto a big fragmented plywood screen. One shows Ms. Chang standing thigh deep in frigid gray water, sponging down a dead whale found washed up on an island off Newfoundland. Its tail floats on the waves, but its massive head is solidly beached. You hear the cries of hungry gulls, and sense the animal’s stink. (In a phone call, the artist recalled feeling, while whale-side, a weight so profound it displaced thought.) The adjacent video finds Ms. Chang performing another ritual cleansing, this time scrubbing the rusted hull of a big commercial ship. Many others are similarly stranded in what was once the vast Aral Sea, in Uzbekistan, now radically shrunk by Soviet-era irrigation projects.

Ms. Chang was pregnant and then a new mother during the eight-year course of this peripatetic project, and it includes photos, installed irregularly in a plywood labyrinth, showing one or another small bowl filled with breast milk she pumped while traveling. These photographs form a series within the larger project titled “Letdown,” which refers to lactation, and also to the emotional roller coaster of early parenthood. Further along the work’s life cycle are paired videos on small monitors featuring the artist’s parents. Her mother’s voice and her baby’s cries, in one video, overlay a song she sings to her father in the other, as he lies unmoving in a hospital bed. Mr. Chang had progressive dementia for 10 years, the artist said, “so mourning took place while he was living.” It is one of several borderline mortality conditions she explores. (There is also an aborted suicide.)

A mood shift, which briefly reprises the feel of early performances, occurs with a series of works based on female urinary devices, both commercial and homemade. As Ms. Chang demonstrates in a three-channel video, parts of it very funny, they allow a woman to pee standing up. We see her perform, deadpan, the guy thing of shaking a repurposed plastic bottle to get the last drops out. Giving a wry twist to the overheated debate around bathroom access, the artist assails borders between genders, and between bodies and their accessories, with a kind of dignified slapstick.

Water bottles from which she drank and then filled with her urine are the subject of one big mock-serious photograph.

The wide-eyed, pleading look of your dog may melt your heart and cause food to vanish from the table, but that doesn’t really mean your pet has become the master of manipulation.

Sometimes a dog’s expression merely reflects yours.

In a new study, researchers in Britain monitored dogs’ facial expressions — particularly the muscle that raises the inner part of the eyebrows and makes their eyes look bigger — while a person was either paying attention to them or turned away, sometimes holding food and sometimes not.

The dogs also stuck out their tongues and barked more when they got attention, compared with when they were being ignored or given food.

“This simply shows that dogs produce more (but not different) facial movements when someone is looking at them,” Juliane Kaminski, the study’s lead researcher and a senior lecturer at the University of Portsmouth in England, said via email.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Today we get to watch a face-off between the good guys and the bad guys, courtesy of David J. Kahn.

Today’s Theme

The GUNFIGHT AT / THE O.K. CORRAL (28D and 62A) took place in October 1881, and was a 30-second shootout between the lawmen of Tombstone, Ariz., and a group of outlaws called the Cowboys (in those days, it was considered an insult to call a law-abiding cattleman a “cowboy”). Mr. Kahn was able to get only one law man (DOC HOLLIDAY) and one bad guy (IKE CLANTON) into his grid for space reasons.

In addition, we have four entries forming a circular “corral” of sorts (31A, 37D, 52A and 35D). All of them are synonyms for the word “O.K.,” but all are clued as something different, neatly hiding the connection to the theme in plain sight. That’s a pretty nice bonus.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had MACAU and MACAW (wrong, Deb! That’s a bird) before MACAO.

49A: Do you get tripped up by clues where the first word is actually a proper name? “Banks of Chicago” sounds as if it refers to places in Chicago where you can keep your money, but we’ve got only a five-letter slot. The constructor and editors have sneakily used the capital-letter-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence rule against you. “Banks” refers to the baseball player ERNIE Banks.

Constructor Notes

I guess I can say with a smile that this is just an O.K. puzzle. This worked only because I was able to find 4 four-letter synonyms for O.K. that could be clued otherwise, which is why “so-so,” at first an obvious synonym, wasn’t included. I also wanted to include a gunfighter on each side. Fun fact: Kirk Douglas, who played Doc Holliday in the 1957 movie, celebrated his centennial last year.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

I bring this up because I was fortunate to have a few rounds of email correspondence with one of the constructors of today’s puzzle — he happens to be making his New York Times Crossword debut. Each time he wrote, I found myself running to the dictionary to look up at least one of the words that flowed effortlessly from his fingers. And the thing is, he wasn’t doing it to look smart. John Lithgow just is smart.

But at least I now know what a “Savoyard” is. If that makes no sense to you right now, wait until you get to 41D.

Jane Goodall’s observations of chimpanzees in the wild challenged conventional wisdom about what made humans exceptional. Brett Morgen’s documentary “Jane,” which tells Ms. Goodall’s story largely through footage of her expeditions, is such an absorbing account of her experiences at a reserve in what is now Tanzania that you may not pause to think about how its imagery was captured.

If Ms. Goodall — who was 26 and had no scientific degree when she first ventured into the forest, hoping to gain acceptance from chimpanzees inclined to run from her — was mostly exploring on her own, who set up the camera for that incredible shot of her climbing? How is it that the animals are so calm in the presence of moviemaking tools?

Video

As an opening title card explains, most of “Jane” comes from 16-millimeter film shot by Hugo van Lawick, the renowned wildlife photographer who joined Ms. Goodall on her travels and eventually became her first husband.

His footage has appeared before, notably in the 1965 National Geographic documentary “Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees,” narrated by Orson Welles. But Mr. Morgen’s film draws on more than 100 rediscovered hours from National Geographic’s archives. The abundant raw material allows Mr. Morgen to construct the impression of a complete narrative arc, and to show the tedious work of gaining the trust of the chimps and collecting data in fast forward, conveying the excitement of scientific discovery with adventure-movie momentum.

Ms. Goodall, who is seen in a fresh interview with Mr. Morgen and heard in excerpts from an audio version of one of her books, narrates her efforts to make contact with the chimps. The footage has been edited in a way that is not strictly faithful to chronology but complements the storytelling. (Even the visuals accompanying the tale of her initial months were filmed later, once Mr. van Lawick had arrived.) Because the archival footage lacked sound, the natural noises — chimp grunts and bird chirps — have been created, seamlessly, from separate recordings made in the Gombe forest that Ms. Goodall once explored.

Such editing-suite sleights of hand may displease purists, and so will an insistent score by Philip Glass, whose melodious montage glue has become something of a documentary cliché. But the flip side of such freehandedness is that “Jane,” like Mr. Morgen’s “Chicago 10” and “The Kid Stays in the Picture” (which he directed with Nanette Burstein), is involving and immediate. He fashions a firsthand account of what Ms. Goodall learned about the chimps’ capacity for toolmaking, nurturing and cruelty, and what they taught her when she became a parent herself.

Many of you don’t know anyone who knows any one of them.
You know, there’s thousands.
GENERAL KELLY: First of all, that’s a — you know, we are at the highest level of the U.S. government.
I know they’re conducting an investigation.","So that’s the process. While that’s happening, a casualty officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on. And then he knocks on the door; typically a mom and dad will answer, a wife. And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places; if the parents are divorced, three different places. And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until — well, for a long, long time, even after the internment. So that’s what happens.

Who are these young men and women? They are the best 1 percent this country produces. Most of you, as Americans, don’t know them. Many of you don’t know anyone who knows any one of them. But they are the very best this country produces, and they volunteer to protect our country when there’s nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate, but required. But that’s all right.

Who writes letters to the families? Typically, the company commander — in my case, as a Marine — the company commander, battalion commander, regimental commander, division commander, Secretary of Defense, typically the service chief, commandant of the Marine Corps, and the President typically writes a letter.

Typically, the only phone calls a family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine, and that is from their buddies. In my case, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan, telling us what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really mattered.

And yeah, the letters count, to a degree, but there’s not much that really can take the edge off what a family member is going through.

So some Presidents have elected to call. All Presidents, I believe, have elected to send letters. If you elect to call a family like this, it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. There’s no perfect way to make that phone call.

When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, my first recommendation was he not do it because it’s not the phone call that parents, family members are looking forward to. It’s nice to do, in my opinion, in any event.

He asked me about previous Presidents, and I said, I can tell you that President Obama, who was my Commander-in-Chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family. That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say, I don’t believe President Obama called. That’s not a negative thing. I don’t believe President Bush called in all cases. I don’t believe any President, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high — that Presidents call. But I believe they all write.

So when I gave that explanation to our President three days ago, he elected to make phone calls in the cases of four young men who we lost in Niger at the earlier part of this month. But then he said, how do you make these calls? If you’re not in the family, if you’ve never worn the uniform, if you’ve never been in combat, you can’t even imagine how to make that call. I think he very bravely does make those calls.

The call in question that he made yesterday — or day before yesterday now — were to four family members, the four fallen. And remember, there’s a next-of-kin designated by the individual. If he’s married, that’s typically the spouse. If he’s not married, that’s typically the parents unless the parents are divorced, and then he selects one of them. If he didn’t get along with his parents, he’ll select a sibling. But the point is, the phone call is made to the next-of-kin only if the next-of-kin agrees to take the phone call. Sometimes they don’t.

So a pre-call is made: The President of the United States or the commandant of the Marine Corps, or someone would like to call, will you accept the call? And typically, they all accept the call.

So he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could. And he said to me, what do I say? I said to him, sir, there’s nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families.

Well, let me tell you what I told him. Let me tell you what my best friend, Joe Dunford, told me — because he was my casualty officer. He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we’re at war. And when he died, in the four cases we’re talking about, Niger, and my son’s case in Afghanistan — when he died, he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.

That’s what the President tried to say to four families the other day. I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing. A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion — that he’s a brave man, a fallen hero, he knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. There’s no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be, with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.

That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted.

It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred, looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life — the dignity of life — is sacred. That’s gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well.

Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. But I just thought — the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred.

And when I listened to this woman and what she was saying, and what she was doing on TV, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this Earth. And you can always find them because they’re in Arlington National Cemetery. I went over there for an hour-and-a-half, walked among the stones, some of whom I put there because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.

I’ll end with this: In October — April, rather, of 2015, I was still on active duty, and I went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami. And it was dedicated to two men who were killed in a firefight in Miami against drug traffickers in 1986 — a guy by the name of Grogan and Duke. Grogan almost retired, 53 years old; Duke, I think less than a year on the job. (Editor’s note: The F.B.I. agent for which the building is named was named Jerry L. Dove, not Duke.)

Anyways, they got in a gunfight and they were killed. Three other FBI agents were there, were wounded, and now retired. So we go down — Jim Comey gave an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to those fallen men and to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve our country so well, and law enforcement so well.

There were family members there. Some of the children that were there were three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade. Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were and how they gave their lives.

And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there and all of that and talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call he gave the money — the $20 million — to build the building. And she sat down, and we were stunned. Stunned that she had done it. Even for someone that is that empty a barrel, we were stunned.

But, you know, none of us went to the press and criticized. None of us stood up and were appalled. We just said, O.K., fine.

So I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America, that let’s not let this maybe last thing that’s held sacred in our society — a young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country — let’s try to somehow keep that sacred. But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of Congress.

So I’m willing to take a question or two on this topic. Let me ask you this: Is anyone here a Gold Star parent or sibling? Does anyone here know a Gold Star parent or sibling?

O.K., you get the question.

Q Well, thank you, General Kelly. First of all, we have a great deal of respect — Semper Fi — for everything that you’ve ever done. But if we could take this a bit further. Why were they in Niger? We were told they weren’t in armored vehicles and there was no air cover. So what are the specifics about this particular incident? And why were we there? And why are we there?

GENERAL KELLY: Well, I would start by saying there is an investigation. Let me back up and say, the fact of the matter is, young men and women that wear our uniform are deployed around the world and there are tens of thousands, near the DMZ in North Korea [sic], in Okinawa, waiting to go — in South Korea — in Okinawa, ready to go. All over the United States, training, ready to go. They’re all over Latin America. Down there, they do mostly drug and addiction, working with our partners — our great partners — the Colombians, the Central Americans, the Mexicans.

You know, there’s thousands. My own son, right now, back in the fight for his fifth tour against ISIS. There’s thousands of them in Europe acting as a deterrent. And they’re throughout Africa. And they’re doing the nation’s work there, and not making a lot of money, by the way, doing it. They love what they do.

So why were they there? They’re there working with partners, local — all across Africa — in this case, Niger — working with partners, teaching them how to be better soldiers; teaching them how to respect human rights; teaching them how to fight ISIS so that we don’t have to send our soldiers and Marines there in their thousands. That’s what they were doing there.

Now, there is an investigation. There’s always an — unless it’s a very, very conventional death in a conventional war, there’s always an investigation. Of course, that operation is conducted by AFRICOM that, of course, works directly for the Secretary of Defense.

There is a — and I talked to Jim Mattis this morning. I think he made statements this afternoon. There’s an investigation ongoing. An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll. The fact is they need to find out what happened and why it happened.

But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand that these young people — sometimes old guys — put on the uniform, go to where we send them to protect our country. Sometimes they go in large numbers to invade Iraq and invade Afghanistan. Sometimes they’re working in small units, working with our partners in Africa, Asia, Latin America, helping them be better.

But at the end of the day, they’re helping those partners be better at fighting ISIS in North Africa to protect our country so that we don’t have to send large numbers of troops.

Any other — someone who knows a Gold Star fallen person.

John?

Q General, thank you for being here today and thank you for your service and for your family’s sacrifice. There has been some talk about the timetable of the release of the statement about the — I think at that point it was three soldiers who were killed in Niger. Can you walk us through the timetable of the release of that information? And what part did the fact that a beacon was pinging during that time have to do with the release of the statement? And were you concerned that divulging information early might jeopardize the soldiers’ attempt to be (inaudible)?

GENERAL KELLY: First of all, that’s a — you know, we are at the highest level of the U.S. government. The people that will answer those questions will be the people at the other end of the military pyramid.

I’m sure the Special Forces group is conducting it. I know they’re conducting an investigation. That investigation, of course, under the auspices of AFRICOM, ultimately will go to the Pentagon. I’ve read the same stories you have. I actually know a lot more than I’m letting on, but I’m not going to tell you.

There is an investigation being done. But as I say, the men and women of our country that are serving all around the world — I mean, what the hell is my son doing back in the fight? He’s back in the fight because — working with Iraqi soldiers who are infinitely better than they were a few years ago to take ISIS on directly so that we don’t have to do it. Small numbers of Marines where he is working alongside those guys. That’s why they’re out there, whether it’s Niger, Iraq, or whatever. We don’t want to send tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines, in particular, to go fight.

I’ll take one more, but it’s got to be from someone who knows — all right.

Q General, when you talk about Niger, sir, what does your intelligence tell you about the Russian connection with them? And the stories that are coming out now, they’re —

GENERAL KELLY: I have no knowledge of any Russian connection, but I was not, in my position, to know that. That’s a question for NORTHCOM or for — not NORTHCOM — for AFRICOM or DOD.

Thanks very much, everybody.

As I walk off the stage, understand there’s tens of thousands of American kids, mostly, doing their nation’s bidding all around the world. They don’t have to be in uniform. You know, when I was a kid, every man in my life was a veteran — World War II, Korea, and there was the draft. These young people today, they don’t do it for any other reason than their selfless — sense of selfless devotion to this great nation.

We don’t look down upon those of you who that haven’t served. In fact, in a way we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll have never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kinds of things our service men and women do — not for any other reason than they love this country. So just think of that.

And I do appreciate your time. Take care.",Full Transcript and Video: Kelly Defends Trump’s Handling of Soldier’s Death and Call to Widow,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/statement-kelly-gold-star.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Even before the disastrous imposition of collective farming, Russia’s new rulers “once again followed the precedent set by the czars,” Applebaum writes; “they banned Ukrainian newspapers, stopped the use of Ukrainian in schools and shut down Ukrainian theaters.” By the mid-1920s, once Soviet power had been firmly established, the regime tried a new policy, as it did in other non-Russian parts of the Soviet Union, giving official status to the Ukrainian language and allowing the production of a definitive Ukrainian-Russian dictionary.

But rather than making the Ukrainians into happy Soviets, this period of limited tolerance only produced more demands for Ukrainian-language schools for the nearly eight million ethnic Ukrainians living in Russia itself, and for Ukrainian border expansions to include some of those ethnic communities. An alarmed Kremlin quickly reversed course.

The end of the 1920s saw a crackdown on the Ukrainian branch of the Orthodox Church and arrests of tens of thousands of Ukrainian teachers and intellectuals — 45 of whom were the subject of a show trial at the Kharkiv Opera House. Thousands of Ukrainian books were removed from schools and libraries. The dictionary project was now judged subversive, and many of those who worked on it were arrested and shot. Ukrainian-language newspapers and magazines were given lists of words not to be used, and replacements closer to Russian. One letter was even removed from Ukrainian Cyrillic, to make it more like the Russian, as if the very alphabet were guilty of treason and had to be punished.

Then came the senseless scheme of compelling some of the Soviet Union’s most productive farmers to abandon their land and move to the untried new collectives. Not only was this imposing an ideological blueprint that didn’t work; it was carried out with a cruelty that guaranteed millions of people in the ethnically Ukrainian rural areas would starve. Peasant families were allowed to keep no food for themselves: Teams of Communist Party activists ripped up floorboards and poked through haylofts with iron rods, confiscating all they found, including grain being kept as seed for the next year’s crop. Despite the rotting, emaciated corpses of starved adults and children piling up along streets and highways and the wolves that took over abandoned farmhouses, the seizures continued, in part to find grain the state could sell abroad for hard currency. When even loyal party officials raised objections, they were fired, jailed or shot. If resistance to the requisitions and to collectivization was not stamped out, Stalin wrote to Lazar Kaganovich, one of his henchmen, in 1932, “we may lose Ukraine.”

The planned starvation, the execution of the territory’s best artists and intellectuals, the destruction of churches and the crushing of traditional village culture terrified into silence any Ukrainians who wanted autonomy or independence. Then finally, 60 years later, what Stalin had feared happened virtually overnight, and Russia did lose Ukraine. The history of all that happened between these two tragically intertwined peoples in the early 20th century fills in the background to Putin’s ruthless desire to gain influence or control over Ukraine once again.

Applebaum has painstakingly mined a vast array of sources, many of which were not available when the historian Robert Conquest wrote his pioneering history of the famine, “The Harvest of Sorrow,” 30 years ago: oral histories of survivors; national and local archives in Ukraine, including those of the secret police; and archives in Russia, which opened in the 1990s and then partly closed again, but not before various scholars published collections of documents from them.

One account of the famine comes from the young Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, who walked 40 miles through starvation-ridden districts in 1933 and, after he left the country, wrote one of the very few eyewitness descriptions of the carnage to appear in the Western press. Jones has been celebrated before, but Applebaum also tells the less known story of how, after he spoke out, Stalin’s government successfully strong-armed British and American correspondents in Moscow into denying what he said — even though some of them had been his sources, telling him what would have been censored from their own dispatches.

His complaint about life in Florence invokes what he portrays as constitutional violations, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that requires the government to accommodate religious practices. Although he is an observant Muslim, the complaint said, he has not been given halal food prepared according to Islamic law, nor has he been permitted to pray collectively with other Muslims or given access to an imam.

During prayer time, it also said, guards permit “white supremacist” inmates in the special security unit to ""curse, yell, scream, and say things that are religiously insulting and offensive to Muslims,” and guards sometimes displayed pornography to him while he was trying to pray and, while searching his cell, “defiled” his prayer rug and Quran, ripping its pages and leaving a sticky liquid on it.

The press office of the Bureau of Prisons had no immediate response to a request for comment. But Gail Johnson, an attorney for Mr. Abdulmutallab, said in a statement that his rights were being violated.

“Prisoners retain fundamental constitutional rights to communicate with others and have family relationships free from undue interference by the government,” she said. “The restrictions imposed on our client are excessive and unnecessary, and therefore we seek the intervention of the federal court.”

In protest of the treatment he alleges, along with restrictions on communicating with relatives like his sister and nieces and nephews, Mr. Abdulmutallab began a hunger strike, the complaint said. In response, prison officials transferred him to an even more restrictive part of the prison known as Range 13, where human contact, even with guards, is rare. The complaint cited a recent Justice Department inspector general report in which a Florence prison psychologist said Range 13 was “a form of torture on some level” and qualified as solitary confinement.

On several occasions, Mr. Abdulmutallab has engaged in a hunger strike to protest, the complaint said, but ceased after being force-fed. As at Guantánamo, the procedure involves being strapped into a restraint chair and having liquid nutritional supplement poured into his stomach through a nasogastric tube inserted through his nose.

The complaint accuses prison officials of using force-feeding before Mr. Abdulmutallab’s life was in danger, and said they are administering it in an unnecessarily painful way by pouring a large volume in very quickly. On one occasion, it said, they inserted the tube into his windpipe rather than his esophagus and poured the supplement into his lungs, making him feel like he was being drowned.",Underwear Bomber Sues Over Treatment in Supermax Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/us/politics/underwear-bomber-lawsuit-prison-treatment.html

The youngsters also might have experienced milder concussions, since they are smaller and would likely hit with less impact.
The study also was observational, meaning that it can link concussions in youth to a greater risk for M.S., but not prove that one causes the other.","But with more and more young people, including children, being diagnosed with concussions, some experts have begun to wonder if there might be links between an injury early in life and a later diagnosis of M.S.

So for the new study, which was published last month in Annals of Neurology, scientists at Orebro University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and other institutions decided to look at the medical histories of every person in Sweden who had been given a multiple sclerosis diagnosis since 1964, when the diagnosis began to be reported to a national medical database.

They found 7,292 men and women who had been given M.S. diagnoses through the end of 2012.

Then, to provide a contrasting cross-section of these patients’ peers, they matched each of those with M.S. with 10 other Swedes who shared their age, gender and county of residence, pulling this data from another database about every Swedish citizen. In total, the scientists analyzed data involving more than 80,000 people.

Finally, the researchers looked into whether any of these people had visited a Swedish hospital for treatment of a concussion or broken bone when they were young. (The Swedes keep extensive health databases.)

The researchers included the information about broken bones because the symptoms of M.S. often begin to affect people years before a diagnosis and can include clumsiness and falls. If people had stumbled and incurred head injuries because they had early M.S., then their disease might be contributing to their concussions and not the other way around, a statistical issue known as reverse causation.

In that case, however, people with M.S. should also have a high incidence of broken bones because of their falls. So the researchers looked at a range of bone injuries as a way to assess the likelihood that reverse causation might be responsible for their injuries.

They also homed in on concussions that occurred when the people in the study were young, dividing that time frame into concussions among children younger than 11, and adolescents between ages 11 and 20.

Then they analyzed the numbers. The results were concerning. Adolescents who had experienced one concussion were about 22 percent more likely to later develop M.S. than those who had not had such head trauma. The risk rose by about 150 percent if a young person had sustained multiple concussions.

Interestingly, concussions experienced during childhood did not contribute to a greater risk of M.S. later.

The findings suggest that “there could be a link” between head injury during adolescence and the development of M.S. as an adult, says Scott Montgomery, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Orebro University, who led the study.

Adolescent brains seem to be less physiologically resilient than those in younger children, he adds, making them potentially more vulnerable to long-term consequences from concussions than children. The youngsters also might have experienced milder concussions, since they are smaller and would likely hit with less impact.

Still, the absolute incidence of M.S. among young people in the study who had had a concussion remained small, Dr. Montgomery says, and many of those who had been injured in adolescence never developed the disease. It is probable, he says, that other factors are involved, including an underlying genetic susceptibility to the condition that, in some young people, might be awakened by a blow to the head.

The study also was observational, meaning that it can link concussions in youth to a greater risk for M.S., but not prove that one causes the other.

The findings remain important and cautionary, however.

“Physical activity and participation in sports should be encouraged in young people,” Dr. Montgomery says. “But we should try to minimize the risk of young people experiencing head injuries.”

And for those who might have had a concussion or three during youth, “talk with your doctor,” Dr. Montgomery says, “especially if you are experiencing any symptoms” of M.S., such as double vision, dizziness or balance problems. These conditions do not necessarily indicate a developing problem, he says, but should be assessed.",Concussions in Teenagers Tied to Multiple Sclerosis Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/well/move/concussions-in-teenagers-tied-to-multiple-sclerosis-risk.html

Sometimes we practice with new cameras around the office or at home before using them on a story. Other times we send them out on a reporting trip for a trial by fire.

The first time we used the V.R. camera Z Cam S1, we took it to the hottest place on Earth: Danakil, Ethiopia, where temperatures can reach 125 degrees Fahrenheit. In the early days of our V.R. production, we’d had a lot of problems with cameras overheating and turning off. So we weren’t sure how the Z Cam would perform in such a difficult environment. To our delight, it never overheated as it captured stunning images for the resulting film, “The Land of Salt and Fire.”

What have been the strengths of using virtual reality for journalism? What unexpected stumbling blocks have you come across with it?

V.R. is great for creating a sense of place. We often use it for stories in which the place is important to the story and being there can create a visceral experience that is rare in other mediums. V.R. can transport our audience to places they otherwise couldn’t or wouldn’t go, as in “The Antarctica Series,” which takes people below and above the ice of Antarctica.

Unexpected stumbling blocks arise frequently because we’re working on the edges of what we know how to do. There’s often a gap between how we want to tell a story and the tools that we have to do it. That’s when we hack available hardware or software to suit our needs.

I don’t know who will make it, but the first immersive media wearable to be widely adopted will look and function more like a pair of reading glasses than like the V.R. headsets we have today. The first generation of modern V.R. and augmented reality headsets are too clunky to go mainstream. They’re heavy and awkward, sometimes connected to a computer by a cable. They’re good prototypes for getting us started in immersive platforms, but I hope someone builds something that’s more convenient for everyday use.

When that’s possible, I think, glasses will eventually replace smartphones.

How are you thinking about augmented reality and its application toward journalism?

A.R. has huge potential for journalism. There are already a few applications that we’ve seen that could be useful in our reporting.

One is creating three-dimensional objects and putting them in the user’s environment. For example, if we build a 3-D model of how gravitational waves are generated from colliding black holes, you could walk around it to observe the mechanics of an invisible astronomical event.

Location-based A.R. has widespread applications for news, travel, culture and real estate. When visiting the vineyards of Sonoma County, you could access tips and highlights from our Travel section.

I’m also very interested in A.R. portals. Imagine a digital “door” in your living room that leads to a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh.

Of course, I’m most excited about the A.R. applications we haven’t thought of yet.

I often joke that Spotify knows me better than anyone in my life. My favorite feature is Spotify’s Discover Weekly, which serves me a personalized playlist of music I’ve never heard. I save the songs I like, and occasionally make my own playlists out of the ones I love. As with any machine learning algorithm, the more you use it, the smarter it gets. At this point, Spotify is really good (probably better than me) at something I don’t have time for anymore — finding new music I like.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I’m going to do something a bit different today. I’ve spilled a few clues, but I want you to get through the puzzle yourself, mostly so you will appreciate the rest of the column. I’ve been looking for an opportunity to develop my Lewis Black impression, and this is it.

Sometimes, when I’m feeling like I haven’t yet had enough pain and humiliation in my life, I take a Zumba class. No, don’t write me letters about how I’m doing it wrong and if I would just relax I’d learn to enjoy it. No one on the entire planet has ever convinced another human being to do anything that way, especially when it comes to tripping over their own two feet. I’ve accepted my fate when it comes to Zumba.

At other times, I solve puzzles by Byron Walden. It has largely the same effect as the Zumba, minus the muscle pain. Mr. Walden, who is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, quietly takes his aggressions out by writing the kind of clues that make many solvers, myself included, feel a lot like this dog:

That’s called misdirection. Misdirection is when you look at a clue like 20D’s “One who tries to avoid being touched” and your brain starts to run through the names of disorders where people don’t like being touched because that’s got to be what the constructor is thinking, right, and then the answer winds up being an odd word like EPEEIST. (A “touch” is when your fencing opponent scores against you.)

It’s when you see a clue like “Fabulous speaker?” and think O.K., maybe it’s AESOP, because you’ve been trained, I mean trained, to think AESOP’s fables whenever you see the word “fabulous” in a clue, but the answer turns out to be LIAR. And he’s not wrong. Someone who tells tales is a LIAR.

“Why am I putting her through this? Is anybody going to want to read something so awful? I don’t even want to write this story.”

I think I’m becoming the opposite of numb. Each tragedy I’ve covered, each loss I’ve absorbed, has rubbed away a little more of the insulation we all create, or were born with, that keeps the ills of the world safely away. After years of this work, I don’t have much insulation left. Now when I go off on assignment, I’m all nerves.

Even before I met Rajuma, I could barely keep it together. My first day in the refugee camps, watching Rohingya men try to remain dignified as they were herded into lines to wait for a pack of glucose biscuits, made my eyes sting.

I was shocked but soon learned that for decades the Rohingya have been walking around with bull’s-eyes on their foreheads. Scapegoated like the Jews in Nazi Germany, called insects like the Tutsis during Rwanda’s genocide, they are Muslim people in a Buddhist land, dehumanized by their own government and made easy prey.

So I started thinking: If we don’t cover this, that’s even worse. That would be a further injustice, a further insult to the Rohingya’s humanity. It would be like telling Rajuma that the world couldn’t be bothered about what she suffered.

It was very difficult to bring that interview to an end. As we parted ways, what was I supposed to say? In our culture we might say she should “see somebody.” But there were no psychotherapists around and I knew she was headed back to a plastic tarp held up by bamboo poles with nothing to do but think about those moments that I had asked her to conjure up.

I wanted to give her every dollar in my wallet. Or hug her. Or punch someone in the face. This is the worst part of being a journalist: feeling helpless. Not only is there nothing you can do about the horrors in front of you, but in most cases there’s only so much you should do. We are recorders, witnesses, not aid workers. Of course, if Rajuma were bleeding in front of me and needed my help, I wouldn’t hesitate to give it. But that wasn’t the situation here; her baby was dead and she would be traumatized forever.

I stood up and lamely shook her hand and said the only thing that felt close to right:

“Ami dukkhito.”

Mr. Trump announced last week that he was cutting them off and Mr. Alexander said he feared millions of people could now find insurance out of their financial reach.

Despite the serious negotiations, there was no firm commitment that a compromise would reach the Senate floor if one could be struck. In fact, Mr. Alexander deferred to Mr. McConnell last month when Mr. McConnell wanted to take one last shot at overturning the health care law. He broke off his talks with Ms. Murray, resuming them only when the repeal effort faltered once again.

All sides agree that Mr. Trump — in conversations with Mr. Alexander and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader — strongly encouraged the bipartisan talks and initially seemed to embrace the agreement to restore the subsidies as a way to buy time for another repeal push. So backers of the plan were blindsided when the president said on Twitter on Wednesday that he could not back what he considered an insurance industry bailout.

Mr. Schumer said the president was undercutting himself by wavering on deals he had helped set in motion, not just on health care but also on issues like immigration. Mr. Schumer suggested that Mr. Trump caved to conservative opposition to the health care compromise.

“This president cannot govern if whenever the hard right frightens him and says, ‘Jump,’ he says, ‘How high?’” Mr. Schumer said.

Backers of the compromise face a tough task in selling the idea to many Republicans who would now be voting not to repeal the health care law, but to temporarily prop it up to avoid a breakdown in the marketplace. In addition, many on Capitol Hill say the compromise could be an important first step toward stabilizing the overall program, making future attempts to repeal it even more difficult.

Mr. Trump’s view will be crucial. His endorsement could provide important political cover for those nervous about voting to bolster the health care law while his opposition could cause Republicans to flee, fearing they will come under attack from the president and his allies.

Mr. Alexander is not retreating. Trying to build momentum, he and Ms. Murray introduced the legislation on Thursday along with two dozen leading Republican and Democratic co-sponsors — an almost unheard-of event on a major bill in this highly polarized environment.

Among Republicans backing the measure were Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, long active in health policy; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the authors of the most recent repeal plan; Bob Corker, Mr. Alexander’s Tennessee colleague who has been feuding with the president; and the group who thwarted Republican repeal efforts, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

“I don’t believe Congress will want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue,” Mr. Alexander said.

He and Ms. Murray said that they had built in protections to make sure the money went to consumers and that it was a mischaracterization to call it an industry bailout. They said both sides gave substantial ground in the talks. Ms. Murray told fellow Democrats this week that it was the toughest bargaining she had been involved in as a senator.

“It sends a powerful message that when members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done,” Ms. Murray said of the negotiation.

But to a large degree, the ultimate success of the talks depends on Mr. McConnell. He has been quiet so far about the bill and whether he would push it forward. The Senate would no doubt have to give it a strong vote for the plan to have any chance of moving through the House.

The support from a growing list of Republican co-sponsors is no guarantee that the Senate will consider the bill if Mr. McConnell views it as too politically risky. He refused to bring to the floor last year a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul that had broad support because of political considerations — despite the fact that Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, was a chief author.

Last year’s ratings were the lowest since Season 3.

And that was before an off-season in which Mr. Kirkman and several other executive producers sued AMC, charging it with shortchanging them on profits from the show. The complaint follows a similar suit by the other co-creator, Frank Darabont, who was fired during production on Season 2.

So the question going into Season 8 is, are the hiccups simply understandable ebbs within a long-running serial, or the beginning of an aging show’s decline?

The producers and AMC insist that however things look from the outside, everyone involved remains committed to the health of their golden goose. The creators predictably say the next phase of the story is the most exciting yet, and they expect “The Walking Dead” to last another 100 episodes or more.

“We want to keep doing it at least as long as Robert keeps doing it,” Scott M. Gimple, the showrunner, said. “We’re prepared for the long haul.”

Since debuting on Halloween 2010 as a horror curiosity, “The Walking Dead” has become a pop culture institution — earlier this month the series donated a collection of props and costumes to the Smithsonian.

But there’s still plenty of story left to tell. (The events of Season 8 begin in Issue 115 of the comic book; Issue 173 comes out in November.) Charlie Collier, the president of AMC networks, points to recent raucous cast appearances at Comic-Cons and traffic to the Season 8 trailer, which has more than seven million views, as evidence that, for all their kvetching last season, fans remain as engaged as ever.

Another thing in the show’s favor is that it is returning to its roots, creatively, with this season’s “All Out War” arc. A coalition led by the show’s hero, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), will face off against Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and his gang, the Saviors. After testing viewers’ patience by separating fan favorites like Rick, Carol (Melissa McBride) and Daryl (Norman Reedus), the new phase reunites the core group against a colorful villain, a dynamic that animated popular stretches like the Governor and Terminus story lines. And unlike the overhyped arrival of Negan in Season 6, the “All Out War” story line will be resolved within a single season.

“Hopefully the people who said they’d never watch the show again” will come back, Mr. Morgan said. “There are going to be some big payoffs.”

Cast members say viewer criticism of last season was not unexpected. Mr. Gimple warned the show’s stars that the brutal murders of the popular characters Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and especially Glenn (Steven Yeun) at the hands of Negan would be controversial, said Danai Gurira, who plays the katana-wielding warrior Michonne.

While the fan outrage and dipping ratings received plenty of coverage, that didn’t translate into more pressure during shooting for the new season. “It was not felt on the set at all,” Ms. Gurira said. (The production did, however, endure a tragedy: John Bernecker, a stuntman on the show, died after an accident on the set in July. The premiere episode honors him in the credits.)

Viewing numbers for “The Walking Dead” peaked in Season 5, with an average of 13.3 million viewers in the key 18-49 demographic advertisers covet tuning in each week (20.1 million total), according to Nielsen. By Season 7, that had fallen to 10.3 million in the demo, a decline of roughly 23 percent in the key cohort. (Over all the show drew an average of 16.4 million total viewers, or roughly 18 percent fewer than in Season 5.)

Though “The Walking Dead” still nearly doubled its closest competitors last season among viewers aged 18-49, media analysts, some of whom downgraded AMC Networks stock in response to last season’s “Walking Dead” numbers, will be watching Season 8 closely for signs of further slippage, said Michael Nathanson of the research firm MoffettNathanson.

“They really have to come out of the gate strong,” said Mr. Nathanson, whose company downgraded AMC in December. (For the record, the stock is up about 7 percent since then.) “Ratings still matter — it’s a driver of ad revenues.”

Mr. Collier, the AMC president, said the falloff in traditional viewing had been offset by increases online. But digital revenue streams are generally not as lucrative as conventional TV ads.

He’s similarly sanguine, at least publicly, about the hiatus’s other big story: The litigation begun by Mr. Kirkman, Gale Ann Hurd and other series producers, which claims that AMC has denied them what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars by manipulating the show’s reported profits. In a statement, AMC called the suit “baseless and predictably opportunistic,” but both sides have pledged to continue working together to keep “The Walking Dead” and its ancillary properties as successful as possible.

“This is a drama that has continued to reinvent itself and remain relevant, and I think that can happen for a long, long time,” Mr. Collier said.

How long exactly? The smart bet is some version of “as long as it wants to,” and possibly longer.

AMC now thinks of “The Walking Dead” as “not just a show, but really as an incredible piece of content that we engage fans with not just for the 16-week season, but for the remainder of the year,” Mr. Collier said.

Besides “Fear the Walking Dead” — which will have a crossover subplot with the original show, Mr. Kirkman announced at New York Comic-Con — there are the highly rated postshow “Talking Dead,” video games and conventions. AMC just created a fan rewards program that will award points for interacting with the “Walking Dead” universe — watching episodes, posting on social media, creating fan fiction — and will soon debut a quarterly merchandise box subscription, a sort of Trunk Club for “Dead” heads.

As for the show itself, it has officially been renewed only for Season 8. But there are signs that the writers are looking far beyond the current time frame. A moment in the trailer seemed to depict Rick as a much older man, though no one involved will elaborate on whether the scene was a time-shift, a dream sequence or some other storytelling device.

All things considered, the only things that might eventually slow the march of “The Walking Dead” are the human physiques of the grueling show’s increasingly middle-aged stars.

“I still have a little bendiness left in my body, but it does get harder,” Mr. Lincoln, 44, said with a laugh. “There comes a point, when you’re rolling around in the dirt covered in zombie blood with a fellow middle-aged man, that you think, is there any dignity left in this?”

“I’m excited about this season — we get to get the band back together,” he added, more seriously. “I’m hoping the audience is going to feel the same way.”","‘The Walking Dead’ at 100: Still a Hit, but for How Much Longer?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/arts/television/the-walking-dead-season-season-8.html

The series’ most promising innovation has been making the protagonist not the crew’s captain but an outsider. Burnham, a human raised by the superrational Vulcans, wants to redeem herself but resists Lorca’s any-means-necessary ruthlessness. (Ms. Martin-Green’s ice-cool performance is layered, but it’s a handicap for a series to center on a character who’s trained to suppress emotion.)

Burnham exemplifies many of the ideals that we once saw in captains Kirk, Picard et al. — respect for the rights of sentient species, the sense of wonder in exploration, restraint in the use of science. But amid the wartime exigencies of “Discovery” these notions are under siege, not ascendant. The potentially fruitful question of “Discovery” is to ask: what happens to your principles when they become inconvenient?

But a little more than halfway through the season’s first eight-episode run (the “second chapter” begins in January), the story lacks momentum. The dialogue is stilted. The chemistry among the still-forming central team is shaky. The series doesn’t have a voice so much as a mood, and that mood is, usually, a bummer.

Some fans have complained that “Discovery” has betrayed the idealistic, optimistic spirit of its earlier fleetmates. I don’t think that’s the problem. “Star Trek” is a kind of national mythology, and it has every right, maybe even the creative obligation, to change to suit its times. (Weirdly, Fox’s joke-not-a-joke “The Orville” is more slavishly like the original series.) Two decades ago, “Deep Space Nine” (for my money the best “Trek”) also focused on the compromises of war.

Rather, “Discovery” feels like it’s adrift between the adventure-of-the-week format of its network-TV predecessors and the kind of complex serial favored by cable and streaming. It has the trappings of serious pay-TV drama: darkness, willingness to kill major characters “Game of Thrones”-style, even profanity. (This “Trek” sets its phasers to “F.”) But they’re mostly superficial.

The most direct antecedent for “Discovery” might not be any “Trek” series but the 2004–09 reboot of “Battlestar Galactica.” That series was also a bleaker riff on a previous series, turning the struggle of humanity against the Cylons — a society of robots that mankind created — into one of the best fictional treatments of the war on terror. Ingeniously, it rethought the Cylons as monotheistic zealots, murderous but with a culture and ideals that could not be easily dismissed.

It would seem that “Discovery” wants to do something similar for the Klingons, the alien enemies (and eventually, allies) who, here, have just united against the Federation. Here, they’re isolationists whose rallying cry — “Remain Klingon!” — one producer has said intentionally echoes Trump-era nationalism.

These Klingons also have elements of cultlike fanaticism, and there’s reference to their having carried out “terrorist” attacks. (They’ve also gotten a makeover, with more prominent prosthetics than their old forehead ridges.) The result is a generic, bellicose mishmash of an enemy, whose subtitle-heavy scenes slow the show down rather than add depth.

And while he was a prodigious chronicler of vernacular American culture, his own roots were hardly common. Born Walker Evans III, the scion of a prominent family, he grew up in privilege, attending Phillips Academy and then Williams College, dropping out after one year.

A turning point for Evans was his decision — like many young men of means — to go to Paris in 1926 to study for a year at the Sorbonne. His stay filled his head with ideas gleaned from Flaubert and Baudelaire, but it was another Frenchman — Eugène Atget — whose work affected him the most, leading to the dry, observational style that became his visual signature.

Clément Chéroux, a French curator, organized a massive Walker Evans retrospective at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which recently traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, (where he is now the head of the photography department). He said Evans tried to emulate in America what Atget did in Paris.

“Atget has tried to define, through his photographs — what is the Parisian vernacular? What is the visual spirit of Paris? And Evans has done exactly the same with America,” Mr. Chéroux said. “What is so interesting for me, in this exchange between American and French culture, is that he has tried to define the American vernacular culture, but with the method and style of French culture.”

Evans embodied a paradox: a member of the American elite drawn to unfussy places, urban workers and desperate farmers, becoming best known for his seminal project with James Agee, “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,” about America’s poor and downtrodden during the Great Depression.

For Mr. Chéroux, this paradox was an interesting way to understand Evans. The curator has done scholarly research into the vernacular, which he defines as “useful, domestic and popular” in an essay in the exhibition catalog. “Maybe one of the reasons why I’m fascinated with Evans is because there is so much paradox in his work,” he said. “There is this dialectical tension between Europe and the U.S., and there is also this very strong dialectical tension between an aristocratic or elite point of view, and a subject which is definitely popular culture, and workers.”

The specific nature of the Atget-Evans vision, with its emphasis on large format, razor sharp, perfectly observed, almost preternaturally quiet moments, allows the photographs to impress viewers nearly a century later. Evans had a simple explanation: Atget’s photographs had a transcendent quality, which he tried to emulate.

Photo

In an interview with Lincoln Kirstein, who wrote an essay for Evans’s 1938 book “American Photographs,” Evans said, “Take Atget, whose work I now know very well. In his work you do feel what some people call poetry. I do call it that also, but a better word for it, to me, is, well – when Atget does even a tree root, he transcends that thing. And by God somebody else does not.”

By looking at things previously unobserved, or subjects once thought beneath the purview of art, Evans created a vision of America that is still inextricable from our national identity. And while his initial exposure to Atget’s work might have been coincidental — his friend Berenice Abbott showed him a trove of the Frenchman’s work — his subsequent choice of subject matter was not.

In another essay in the exhibition catalog, Evans said his early work was influenced by his feelings about the United States. “I was really anti-American at the time,” he said. “America was a big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment. I could just hear my father saying, ‘Why do you want to look at those scenes, they’re depressing. Why don’t you look at the nice things in life?’ Nothing original about that though.”

This might be the key to understanding his role in the history of photography, as he heavily influenced subsequent generations, including the famed “New Topographics” movement of the 1970s. (When asked via email whether Evans’s work had inspired him and his colleagues, Stephen Shore simply replied, “Yes.”)

According to Mr. Chéroux, Evans was able to adopt a neutral stance and let the magic, or inherent tension, of a scene speak for itself. He notably contrasted this style against the showy, artsy technique employed by contemporaries like Alfred Stieglitz and the Modernists.

“He wants to disappear in front of his subject, to let this emotion transfer from the subject to the viewer,” he said of Evans. “I think this is really what he understood. It’s the reason why he is so close to Atget. All the photographers who think that the subject is more important than themselves are in this position.”

The retrospective, while focusing on the past, and including selections from Evans’s personal collection of vernacular art, also allows viewers to appreciate how photography, a slice out of time, relates to the present. In particular, his 1937 photographs showing people displaced by floods in the South are just as relevant today.

“That’s the power of art,” Mr. Chéroux said, “to address some historical questions, but to address them in the present time. To create a kind of effect that is both present and past, and I think this is something photography is really great at.”

The title of this video explains what’s wriggling unseen inside the artist’s shirt, creating a comically — if powerfully — quasi-erotic ruckus. In another celebrated early video, she exchanges an onion, mouth to mouth, with each of her parents; tears ensue.

For this eagerly awaited exhibition, her largest to date, Ms. Chang (who was born in San Francisco and works in Los Angeles) has created an integrated, multidisciplinary installation of mostly new work that reframes her early investigations of identity and its straying boundaries. Engrossing and deeply moving, “The Wandering Lake 2009-2017,” at the Queens Museum, mostly shifts attention away from the artist’s body, relying on moving water as a metaphor for concerns ranging from gender fluidity and internet surfing to climate change and migration. Curated by Hitomi Iwasaki, the show touches on a child’s birth and a father’s death, as well as more global losses — of languages, cultures and even the geographical features that shape them. A running theme, sometimes elusive but potent nonetheless, is material and psychological instability, and meaning that spills the boundaries of individual works.

At the outset are two videos, each projected onto a big fragmented plywood screen. One shows Ms. Chang standing thigh deep in frigid gray water, sponging down a dead whale found washed up on an island off Newfoundland. Its tail floats on the waves, but its massive head is solidly beached. You hear the cries of hungry gulls, and sense the animal’s stink. (In a phone call, the artist recalled feeling, while whale-side, a weight so profound it displaced thought.) The adjacent video finds Ms. Chang performing another ritual cleansing, this time scrubbing the rusted hull of a big commercial ship. Many others are similarly stranded in what was once the vast Aral Sea, in Uzbekistan, now radically shrunk by Soviet-era irrigation projects.

Ms. Chang was pregnant and then a new mother during the eight-year course of this peripatetic project, and it includes photos, installed irregularly in a plywood labyrinth, showing one or another small bowl filled with breast milk she pumped while traveling. These photographs form a series within the larger project titled “Letdown,” which refers to lactation, and also to the emotional roller coaster of early parenthood. Further along the work’s life cycle are paired videos on small monitors featuring the artist’s parents. Her mother’s voice and her baby’s cries, in one video, overlay a song she sings to her father in the other, as he lies unmoving in a hospital bed. Mr. Chang had progressive dementia for 10 years, the artist said, “so mourning took place while he was living.” It is one of several borderline mortality conditions she explores. (There is also an aborted suicide.)

A mood shift, which briefly reprises the feel of early performances, occurs with a series of works based on female urinary devices, both commercial and homemade. As Ms. Chang demonstrates in a three-channel video, parts of it very funny, they allow a woman to pee standing up. We see her perform, deadpan, the guy thing of shaking a repurposed plastic bottle to get the last drops out. Giving a wry twist to the overheated debate around bathroom access, the artist assails borders between genders, and between bodies and their accessories, with a kind of dignified slapstick.

5A: Hi, kids! I wasn’t around for ADLAI Stevenson’s presidential campaign either, but I got this and I’ll explain how I did it.

In the mid-20th century, it was apparently fashionable among campaign slogan writers to try to make their slogans rhyme, primarily because it would have been considered laughable at the time to suggest that the candidate might want to have a beer with anyone who wasn’t at least a governor. Slogan writers would sit in small, smoke-filled offices with long lists of words that rhymed with their candidate’s name (“Badly for Adlai?” “No. ...” “Sadly for Adlai?” No!”), and they were released only when they hit on something that was not terrible and could fit on a campaign button. My point is, if you see a clue like “‘Madly for ___’ (1952 campaign slogan),” you have enough information to know that you should be thinking about a midcentury candidate whose name rhymed with “madly.”

42A: The holy Kaaba is a CUBE-shaped mosque in the town of Makka.

49A/57D: It’s unusual to see two words that are so close in current meaning in the same puzzle (YEARN and YENS), especially when they are clued so similarly. The etymology of the two words is different, however, so it’s allowable.

67A: “Even Homer NODS” is an idiom that means that even people who are the best at something can make mistakes during a momentary lapse in concentration. It’s an allusion to the epic poet Homer’s work, which apparently contains errors in continuity.

On Wednesday, 2012 Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney became the latest and most decorated American gymnast to speak out about being sexually abused by Larry Nassar, who served as the USA Gymnastics women’s team doctor for two decades. “It started when I was 13 years old, at one of my first National Team training camps, in Texas, and it didn’t end until I left the sport,” Maroney, now 21, wrote of Nassar on Twitter.

“Is it possible for survivors to speak out, without putting careers, and dreams in jeopardy?” Maroney asked. There is increasingly good reason to think that the answer is yes.

Nassar is facing 33 charges of criminal sexual conduct in Michigan and pleaded guilty to federal pornography charges in July; he is expected to spend decades in prison. Last August, the floodgates opened after Rachael Denhollander, who says she was abused by the doctor as a 15-year-old gymnast in Michigan, filed a criminal complaint for sexual assault against Nassar, who was also a faculty member at Michigan State University and team physician at a local club. Now some 140 individuals have accused him of sexual abuse.

After revelations of Nassar’s widespread abuse over several decades, Aly Raisman, a 2012 and 2016 Olympian, criticized USA Gymnastics this summer for its handling of Nassar and for not doing enough to help his victims. She called out the fact that Steve Penny, the former USA Gymnastics president who resigned in March amid criticism that the organization did not act quickly enough, reportedly received a $1 million severance package. Raisman, who has not claimed that she herself suffered abuse, wants to compete in the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Publicly criticizing your sport’s own governing body when you hope to again compete at the highest level is a gutsy move — and a sign of a significant cultural shift in the sport.

“The huddle has been romanticized, with good reason,” said Joe Theismann, a Washington Redskins quarterback for 12 seasons and the league’s most valuable player in 1983. “We did it so often. I know people wondered what was going on in there. Personally, I always found it fascinating that the crowd noise would be deafening but the huddle was usually a very, very quiet place.”

Roger Staubach, the fabled leader of the 1970s Dallas Cowboys and a Heisman Trophy winner, said the huddle was the best time to take the pulse of a team.

“As players in the huddle, you’re all alone in the middle of the field but together at the same time,” Staubach said. “You see who is hurt, who’s tired or who’s spitting mad. You can take that all in, which can be powerful.”

Michael Oriard, a former center with the Kansas City Chiefs, an all-American at Notre Dame and the author of books on football culture, called the huddle a sacred place, because it belonged to the players and not the coaches.

“There was bonding and a kind of sharing of intensity,” Oriard, a professor emeritus at Oregon State, said. “Late in a game, you look around at the faces of your teammates and it’s unspoken, or sometimes spoken: ‘This is our last chance before time runs out.’ It’s a communal experience that will be lost.”

Today’s N.F.L. players, for the most part, do not feel the pull of the huddle in the same way.

“There’s always been some allure of the huddle where people imagine Ray Lewis or some star player yelling and pumping up the whole team,” Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said. “That’s an image on TV and in Hollywood movies. But that doesn’t really happen now.

“Everything is happening so much faster that a whole conversation might be communicated in just a look. There’s no time for theatrics.”

Spencer Long, the center for the Washington Redskins, said the terminology of the modern N.F.L. play is so complex it has overwhelmed the traditional huddle.

“We have plays that are like 20 words long — so there goes the break time in the huddle,” Long said. “And each part of that long play call is aimed at a different part of the team. So people’s minds are going in different directions. Frankly, it’s almost as easy to signal all that without taking the time to get together.”

One of Long’s teammates, outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, said the crowd was so noisy during home games that the defensive unit could not hear what was said in a huddle anyway.

“If we have to talk, it’s one-on-one when you shout in someone’s ear,” Kerrigan said.

Defenses in general are growing more averse to huddling. Before each play nowadays, the middle linebacker simply shouts and signals the defensive scheme called by a sideline coach.

The disappearing huddle is also a function of logistics. The N.F.L. is now a pass-happy league, so it is common for a host of players on both sides of the line of scrimmage to have to dash downfield for 50 yards on several successive plays.

“Do you know how much energy I would waste if I had to run back to a huddle after every sprint down the field?” Jenkins said. “That’s why I don’t even try.”

Even the kickers don’t enter a huddle any longer.

“Not really,” Washington’s Dustin Hopkins said. “Everybody already knows their job on the play.”

The origin of the huddle appears to date to the 1890s, when it was first used by players at a school for the deaf, Gallaudet University, where quarterbacks had been communicating to teammates using sign language. Because both teams in games were often from schools for the hearing-impaired, the opposition could easily discern the coming play call by watching the quarterback’s hands.

Gallaudet quarterback Paul Hubbard’s solution was to summon teammates into a huddle that shielded his team’s intentions. The practice spread throughout football, especially as teams left behind primitive, run-only schemes for more sophisticated formations that included forward passes.

Various other universities have staked a claim to inventing the huddle, including Illinois, Georgia and Oregon, although a majority of early 20th century football historians point to Hubbard and Gallaudet, in Washington, D.C.

What is certain is that a huddle soon followed every play as football spiked in popularity. Stories from and about the huddle, a unique convention in a major American sport, began to color the historical narrative of the game, whether it was the 1939 Heisman Trophy winner, Nile Kinnick, exhorting teammates in the huddle during an upset of Notre Dame or Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas reconfiguring his team’s pass routes on the fly in the huddle.

Befitting a rough game in which tempers run hot, the huddle was also the place where teammates clashed and railed against one another for missed tackles or dropped passes. On the flip side, it could also be used as the setting to calm frayed nerves.

In the Super Bowl in 1989, the San Francisco 49ers trailed by 3 points with a little more than three minutes remaining in the game. In the huddle before a final drive that began at the San Francisco 8-yard line, Montana noticed that his teammates seemed more tense than usual, especially tackle Harris Barton. Spotting the comedian and actor John Candy in the stands, Montana tapped Barton and said, “Look, isn’t that John Candy?”

Barton smiled. The 49ers scored the game-winning touchdown in the final minute.

“Sometimes the huddle is the place to make a joke so everyone can relax and just go about their jobs,” Montana recalled later.

The huddle became so prominent culturally it even went through a period of renovation, like a living room redesigned into a more open concept by a home decorator.

Near the middle of the last century, some teams, most notably the Chiefs of the renegade American Football League, chose a more accessible huddle by forming two rows, like a small choir group. Ten players would have their backs turned to the opposition while facing the quarterback as he imparted the play instructions.

Although it is more in vogue than ever, the no-huddle, or hurry-up, offense, has been around for decades.

In the 1980s, Sam Wyche, the coach of the Cincinnati Bengals, introduced the system to the N.F.L.

In the early 1990s, Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly ran a hurry-up offense called the K-Gun that led to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances.

The main objective of the Buffalo offense was to string plays together so rapidly the defense did not have time to insert fresh players or to substitute strategically to better contest something like an obvious passing situation.

That remains a primary goal of the modern N.F.L. no-huddle offense. In fact, Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson called the term “no-huddle” a misnomer.

“It implies we’re rushing, which is not always true,” Watson said. “What we’re really trying to do is outfox the defense. So we’re just not huddling.”

Still, there are times in every N.F.L. game when both teams will universally huddle: during the mandated TV timeouts.

“The TV timeouts are when we can interact,” Giants quarterback Eli Manning said. “You can go over a route change with a wide receiver or talk to your linemen. Guys will be encouraging each other, you know, ‘Two minutes to go, let’s punch it into the end zone.’ It does happen.”

And then play resumes and the team might not convene again until the game is over.

It is a style of football that does not, however, unnerve the youngest players in the N.F.L. Many of them have been playing in no-huddle or hurry-up offenses since they were young teenagers.

“I’ve never huddled,” Chris Moore, the Ravens’ second-year wide receiver, said. “Not in high school or in college. I don’t know any other way.”

But Moore, 24, wonders if he might someday have to learn to huddle.

Why?

Because opposing teams are cracking the no-huddle code words and signals that offenses use to communicate on the field.

“Maybe eventually they’ll get so good at stealing signals,” Moore said, “we’ll have to come back into the huddle so we’re the only ones who know what’s going on.”

Which would mean the huddle would be reborn. In a twist, it would be newly valued for the very thing that brought about its invention in the first place: the need for secrecy.","Ready, Set, Gone!

Many survivors suffer from “post-Ebola syndrome” — debilitating muscle and joint pain, headaches, fatigue, hearing loss and other lingering ills, sometimes even seizures.

A Virus That Lurks in the Eye

Like the patients he is now trying to help, Dr. Crozier was blinded in one eye by uveitis and recovered — but then lost his sight a second time, to a cataract. He had surgery in March.

His eye disease, described on May 7, 2015, in The New England Journal of Medicine, put the world on alert. Nearly two months after he had seemingly recovered from Ebola, and after his blood was free of it, severe uveitis suddenly developed — and Dr. Yeh was stunned to find that the fluid inside Dr. Crozier’s eye was teeming with active virus. At that time, uveitis was also emerging in West Africa.

Even though the virus may still lurk inside the eye in survivors with uveitis, it is not on the surface or in tears, so patients cannot spread Ebola through casual contact. But operating on them might pose a risk to surgeons who open the eye.

Eventually, the immune system seems to eliminate the virus, but no one knows how long that takes. Eighteen months after the virus was first found inside Dr. Crozier’s eye, a repeat test was negative. But when the virus level actually dropped is not known.

Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Health and Sanitation was eager for Emory’s help, according to Dr. Kwame Oneill, who manages its Comprehensive Program for Ebola Survivors.

“After Ian became ill and had complications, he became a pioneer, a rallying point,” Dr. Oneill said. “Ian’s story was the turning point for survivors.”

The eye hospital in Freetown also welcomed the researchers. Dr. Lowell Gess, who founded the hospital in 1982, had recognized that uveitis was a severe problem in many patients. In 2015, during the epidemic, Dr. Gess, who was 94, began alerting Ebola treatment centers to the condition and recommending medications for it.

How many survivors have eye trouble is not known. Many live in far-flung provinces and have lost touch with health authorities. But a volunteer group, the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors, has tried to find patients who need help, and has helped pay for travel and lodging so they could consult the doctors from Emory.

This is where Alan Jacobs’s absolutely splendid forthcoming book “How to Think” comes in. If Thaler’s work is essential for understanding how the market can go astray, Jacobs’s emphasis on the relational nature of thinking is essential for understanding why there is so much bad thinking in political life right now.

Jacobs makes good use of C. S. Lewis’s concept of the Inner Ring. In every setting — a school, a company or a society — there is an official hierarchy. But there may also be a separate prestige hierarchy, where the cool kids are. They are the Inner Ring.

There are always going to be people who desperately want to get into the Inner Ring and will cut all sorts of intellectual corners to be accepted. As Lewis put it, “The passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things.”

People will, for example, identify and attack what Jacobs calls the Repugnant Cultural Other — the group that is opposed to the Inner Ring, which must be assaulted to establish membership in it.

Other people will resent the Inner Ring, and they will cut all sorts of intellectual corners in order to show their resentment. These people are quick to use combat metaphors when they talk about thinking (he shot down my argument, your claims are indefensible). These people will adopt shared vague slurs like “cuckservative” or “whitesplaining” that signal to the others in the outsider groups that they are attacking the ring, even though these slurs are usually impediments to thought.

Jacobs notices that when somebody uses “in other words” to summarize another’s argument, what follows is almost invariably a ridiculous caricature of that argument, in order to win favor with the team. David Foster Wallace once called such people Snoots. Their motto is, “We Are the Few, the Proud, the More or Less Constantly Appalled at Everyone Else.”

Jacobs nicely shows how our thinking processes emerge from emotional life and moral character. If your heart and soul are twisted, your response to the world will be, too. He argues that by diagnosing our own ills, we can begin to combat them. And certainly I can think of individual beacons of intellectual honesty today: George Packer, Tyler Cowen, Scott Alexander and Caitlin Flanagan, among many.

But I’d say that if social life can get us into trouble, social life can get us out. After all, think of how you really persuade people. Do you do it by writing thoughtful essays that carefully marshal facts? That works some of the time. But the real way to persuade people is to create an attractive community that people want to join. If you do that, they’ll bend their opinions to yours. If you want people to be reasonable, create groups where it’s cool to be reasonable.

Jacobs mentions that at the Yale Political Union members are admired if they can point to a time when a debate totally changed their mind on something. That means they take evidence seriously; that means they can enter into another’s mind-set. It means they treat debate as a learning exercise and not just as a means to victory.

How many public institutions celebrate these virtues? The U.S. Senate? Most TV talk shows? Even the universities?

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

But her teenage discovery that her grandmother’s town was once home to thousands of Jews who perished in the Holocaust set her on a different path: a 30-year journey documenting persecuted religious minorities around the world.

Today she no longer considers herself religious “in terms of attending church,” but she appreciates the spiritual passion and ecstasy she documents in religious settings in far-flung countries. “My work can be a kind of prayer,” she said. “With time, I understood that what is interesting to me is not God — but God in people.”

Her research has led her to photograph Sufis in northern Africa, Christians in the Middle East, Tibetan Buddhist monks, Old Believers in Eastern Europe, Voudou practitioners in Haiti and Hasids in Galilee. Photographs from her work since 2001 are now featured in a book, “Where Gods Whisper,” published by Contrasto Books.

She has documented the unspeakable cruelties committed in the name of religion as well as uplifting moments of fellowship among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Her mission, to photograph oppressed religious minorities, she said, is a “kind of moral and ethical necessity.”

As a teenager, she had photographed Russian Orthodox churches where she felt seduced by the mysticism and the smells, colors and sounds that washed over her. At 19, she wandered along the borders of eastern Poland searching for remnants of communities and interviewing Byzantine Christians, Jews and Muslim Tatars. She has continued this work in pilgrimages to holy sites across five continents — teaching herself photography along the way.

Her grandparents’ house in Warka was a veritable shrine. “In one corner stood Our Lady of Perpetual Help, in another Our Lady of Sorrows,” she said and on Good Friday the townsfolk gathered in a Baroque church overlooking the river, where they knelt in prayer.

She was 6 when she learned that this had not always been the case.

“Beyond the bridge there was a sand hill that reared up steep as a mountain to our young eyes,” she wrote in “God’s People: A Travel Into Another Europe,” an earlier book. “In winter, our favourite sport was sledding down it and breaking the ice around the willows on the riverbank. One day around Christmas, my sled hit a rock and when I looked closely, I could see strange signs under the snow. Digging with my hands, I unearthed a sculpted lion. This lion buried in the snow, with arcane signs like hieroglyphics, left me breathless with astonishment. I felt as if I had discovered something fabulous, like those great sea captains and explorers, Ahab, Fridtjof Nansen and Eric the Red, that I had read about in the books my grandfather kept for us on his bookshelf.”

Ms. Bulaj had stumbled upon remains of a vibrant Jewish culture that had once flourished in her grandmother’s town, but had withered under centuries of virulent anti-Semitism and had ultimately been destroyed during the Holocaust. It was the town’s “total silence” about their former neighbors that led Ms. Bulaj to dedicate her life to documenting religious minorities.

Ms. Bulaj’s photographs bring us into the lives of endangered and oppressed communities while revealing the enduring power of spiritual experiences. Her work is a spiritual experience, too.

“I photograph instinctively,” she said. “I am close to them, I am touching them, I am crying for them.”

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

The appearance came after Mr. Trump and the White House were consumed by criticism after the president’s actions this week — first appearing to criticize former presidents for failing to call the families of fallen service members and later for the words Mr. Trump chose to use in speaking with the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson.

Mr. Kelly defended Mr. Trump by offering a detailed, even excruciating description of what happens to those killed in combat, including how the remains are packed in ice for the flights back to the United States. He testified to the deep pain that parents feel when they get an early-morning knock on the door from an official there to tell them that their son or daughter has been killed in action.

“The casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member,” Mr. Kelly said, his eyes reddening as he spoke.

He said that presidents often are not among those who call family members directly, and he confirmed what Mr. Trump had alluded to publicly this week: that former President Barack Obama had not called him after Lieutenant Kelly was killed.

“That was not a criticism, that was simply to say I don’t believe President Obama called,” Mr. Kelly said, adding that President George W. Bush and other presidents did not always make personal phone calls to family members. He said Lieutenant Kelly’s friends in Afghanistan called him in the hours after his son died.

“Those were the only phone calls that really matter,” Mr. Kelly said. “Yeah, the letters count to a degree. But there’s not much that can take the edge off.”

The controversy over Mr. Trump’s remarks began even before he made the calls to the families, when former Obama administration officials took offense at the suggestion that Mr. Obama had not done as much as Mr. Trump to pay honor to the fallen.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump did not intend that to be a criticism of his predecessor, but rather was repeating what Mr. Kelly had briefed him on before he got the question at an impromptu news conference on Monday in the Rose Garden.

Mr. Kelly expressed frustration and even anger at the fact that the conversation between Mr. Trump and Sergeant Johnson’s widow was exposed to the world by Ms. Wilson, a friend of the family, who was in the car with the family when the president’s call came in.

“I thought at least that was sacred,” Mr. Kelly said, expressing dismay at other aspects of society that were no longer sacred, including women, religion and Gold Star families.

Ms. Wilson had publicized her criticism of Mr. Trump’s call, saying that the president had told Sergeant Johnson’s widow that he “knew what he signed up for,” and that the family was offended by Mr. Trump’s words.

Mr. Kelly said that Mr. Trump had tried, in the call, to express what Mr. Kelly had talked to him about ahead of time — that people like her husband were doing what they loved, and what they had chosen to do, when they were killed serving the country.

“That’s what the president tried to say to four families,” Mr. Kelly said.

Mr. Kelly said that he was so upset on Wednesday that he went to the cemetery to walk among the service members who had died fighting for the country.

Intel said its intent “was to convey the performance capabilities of our processors through the visual metaphor of a sprinter,” but acknowledged, “Unfortunately, our execution did not deliver our intended message and in fact proved to be insensitive and insulting.”

Dove, May 2011

In 2011, Dove was criticized for another ad: this one showing three women standing side by side, each with lighter skin than the woman next to her. Behind them were signs reading “before” and “after”; the “before” sign, positioned behind an African-American woman, showed cracked skin, while the “after” sign, behind a white woman, showed smooth skin.

The fact that the most recent ad was Dove’s second to cause offense was not lost on social media users.

Popchips, May 2012

Popchips drew fire in 2012 for an ad in which Ashton Kutcher played several characters — including a Bollywood producer named Raj, complete with brownface and an Indian accent.

Popchips initially urged viewers to watch the ad in the humorous “spirit it was intended.” Later, its chief executive, Keith Belling, said in a statement: “Our team worked hard to create a lighthearted parody featuring a variety of characters that was meant to provide a few laughs. We did not intend to offend anyone. I take full responsibility and apologize to anyone we offended.”

Qiaobi, May 2016

In a 2016 commercial for the Chinese company Qiaobi’s laundry detergent, an Asian woman shoves a detergent pod into a black man’s mouth and puts him in a washing machine, from which he emerges as a light-skinned Asian.

A spokeswoman for Qiaobi, Xu Chunyan, was unapologetic. “We did this for some sensational effect,” she said at the time. “If we just show laundry like all the other advertisements, ours will not stand out.”

Nivea, April 2017

In April, the skin care company Nivea released a deodorant ad that read, “White is purity.” White supremacists on the internet took note, with one 4chan user writing, “Nivea has chosen our side.”

What You’ll Find

Victorians abound. South of Montauk Highway, the main east-west thoroughfare, grandes dames are set back on deep lots along broad, shady avenues stretching south to the bay.

“A sprinkling of homes have docks,” said Andrea Casey, a salesperson with Century 21 Bay’s Edge Realty. While most of the coastline is reserved for commercial and public use, houses along Sunset Drive and West Lane back up to canals.

At the tip of Foster Avenue, Sayville Marina Park’s three tennis courts, sandy beach and boat docks dominate the waterfront. Nearby, manicured gardens and a gazebo at Land’s End Caterers provide a picturesque bay-front setting for weddings, said Manon Compitello, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who lives in Sayville.

North of Montauk Highway, there are newer two-story houses built on three-quarter-acre lots on cul-de-sacs. Capes and ranches occupy smaller lots. Condos, co-ops, age-restricted rental apartments and an assisted-living facility line Lakeland Avenue, the thoroughfare stretching north to Sunrise Highway’s big box shopping areas.

What You’ll Pay

“We get a lot of first-time home buyers who want to be in Sayville,” said Leesa Byrnes, broker-owner of Leesa Byrnes Realty. A three-bedroom, two-bath ranch in good shape on a quarter-acre lot, she said, will run between $375,000 and $400,000. Homes that need work range from the low- to mid-$300,000s, while trade-up homes with four bedrooms and two and a half baths on half-acre lots will cost about $650,000.

On Oct. 11, there were 39 houses and nine condominiums on the market. The priciest, at $1,199,000, was a restored five-bedroom 1890 Victorian with an in-ground pool on a half-acre. The least expensive, at $245,000, was a two-bedroom, one-level condo at the age-restricted Sunrise Village, a gated community built in 1987.

Good schools are a draw, Ms. Compitello said, and because Sayville is not incorporated, “you get all the benefits of a town without a village tax.”

But “one of our biggest struggles is our lack of inventory” coupled with “lots of buyers,” she added, noting that homes are selling faster and at higher prices than a year ago. The average sales price in 2017, through Oct. 11, was $453,736, a 5.8 percent increase over the average price of the same period the previous year, $428,691.

The Vibe

Locals buzz about plans for the former Island Hills Golf Club, at the hamlet’s northern edge. Developers Gregg and Mitchell D. Rechler, who bought the property last year, have been meeting with community groups, hoping to change the single-family zoning to build Greybarn, a multifamily rental community with 1,378 apartments “geared to keep millennials and downsizers close to home,” Gregg Rechler said.

Clustered in three- and four-story buildings, with rooflines and eaves resembling large Hamptons-style summer houses, the property is being designed to “benefit the people who already live in the community, as well as the residents who live in Greybarn,” Mr. Rechler said. A 22-acre “perimeter park around the property that equates to a two-mile walking and bike trail will have various pocket parks as it goes along,” he continued, including a playground, an exercise park and a dog park. Plans also call for a community farm, a pond, multiple swimming pools and a large clubhouse with a fitness center and screening rooms.

A shuttle will take residents from Greybarn to stores and restaurants downtown.

The Schools

Students in kindergarten through grade five attend Cherry Avenue Elementary School, Lincoln Avenue Elementary School or Sunrise Drive Elementary School. Grades six to eight are served by Sayville Middle School. Students move up to Sayville High School for grades nine to 12.

The latest available mean SAT scores were 533 in reading, 564 in math and 521 in writing, compared to New York State scores of 489, 501 and 477.

Some Sayville properties are zoned for the Connetquot Central School District.

The Commute

Commuters to Manhattan, 56 miles west, can catch a train at the Sayville station on the Babylon branch of the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour rides to Penn Station take from an hour and 16 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes. Most trips to Manhattan require changing trains in Jamaica or Babylon. The monthly fare is $391.

The History

Once the South Side Railroad reached Sayville in 1868, the hamlet became a summer resort. Actors and actresses stayed in hotels and rented houses in the area. From 1909 to 1919, a seasonal trolley — initially horse-drawn, later electric — connected the railroad station with hotels along Candee Avenue, said George J. Munkenbeck, the Islip town historian.","Sayville, N.Y.: A Walkable Downtown and Victorians by the Bay",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/realestate/living-in-sayville-ny.html

SAN FRANCISCO — In an escalation of its ride-hailing war against Uber, Lyft has begun to explore going public in 2018 and is trying to strengthen its position by raising more capital, including $1 billion in new financing led by an investment arm of Google’s parent company.

Lyft has had talks with investment banks about an initial public offering next year, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the conversations are confidential. Lyft has not decided which bank may become its lead underwriter for an I.P.O., the people said.

To bolster itself ahead of any public offering, Lyft on Thursday said it had raised $1 billion in financing led by CapitalG, a venture investment arm of Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet. The funding values Lyft at $10 billion before the introduction of new capital — a significant jump from the company’s last valuation of $6.9 billion.

The new investment further complicates the convoluted web of financial relationships in the ride-hailing industry, where companies like Lyft and Uber have hauled in enormous amounts of funding from firms that often put money into competing companies.

These giant shrooms typically pop up in acidic soils near spruce, oak or birch trees and when they get enough rain. While Mr. Reisz admires them, he probably won’t be feeding these magical-looking mushrooms to his children. They contain two mind-altering neurotoxins called ibotenic acid and muscimol which are known to affect humans and other animals.

Strange things can happen when mammals ingest them, too. In January, news reports suggested that eating fly agaric fungi made fearless coyotes terrorize motorists in the moonlight in California. Reindeer historically have tripped on them too, and in some places fly agaric has even been associated with Christmas. Some historians even chalk the victories of Viking “Beserker Warriors” to the fearlessness induced after ingesting Amanita muscaria.

In studies using rats, muscimol was infused into parts of the amygdala, a brain region that is known to process emotional fear memories in humans. The drug shut down the rats’ ability to learn about and respond to threats.

But in humans, it can also do the opposite. Its effects range from dry mouth and rapid heartbeat to euphoria, hallucinations, feeling closer to God and fear.

Incorrect doses or preparations are poisonous. In at least one case, doctors found the fly agari in the stomach contents of a person found in a coma. Additionally, Amanita muscaria are often confused with relatives: deadly impostors known as the death cap and the destroying angel.

Mr. Reisz thinks that maybe the mushrooms he found were able to get so big and numerous because of recent weather, and that other locals, seeking them for their psychoactive properties, had not yet picked them.

It was well known that Ms. Darrieux’s favorite director was Max Ophuls. After “La Ronde,” her first collaboration with Ophuls, they worked together in “Le Plaisir” (1952), about prostitutes on a country outing, and “Madame de … ” (1953), released in the United States as “The Earrings of Madame de … ,” a tale of jewelry, debt and infidelity.

Ms. Darrieux became an international film star in Anatole Litvak’s “Mayerling” (1936), playing the teenage mistress of Rodolfo (Charles Boyer), crown prince of Austria, in a retelling of the Habsburg tragedy. American critics praised both her beauty and her performance. She was only 19, and it was her 19th film.

Her new stardom was ratified by a timeless phenomenon: women around the world copied her hairstyle. “Danielle Darrieux appears with her hair bundled on top of her head in ‘Mayerling,’ ” Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times in 1938, reviewing another film entirely. “And a few months later, all the girls are building bird’s nests in their tresses.”

Ms. Darrieux had an abbreviated chance at Hollywood stardom, traveling to the United States in 1937 and signing a contract with Universal. She was soon cast as a young woman looking for a rich husband in “The Rage of Paris” (1938), which also starred Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Louis Hayward.

But after dipping her toe in the Hollywood waters, she declined to plunge in, returning to France immediately after making “The Rage of Paris” and, pleading illness (“ill health resulting from nervous strain,” The New York Times reported), delayed her return. Again and again.

By the time she made her next American movie, she was in her 30s and, by Hollywood standards, ready for older-generation roles. She was cast as Jane Powell’s long-lost mother in “Rich, Young and Pretty” (1951). In 1956 she played Richard Burton’s mother (although she was only eight years his senior) in “Alexander the Great.” In between she starred in Joseph Mankiewicz’s espionage drama “Five Fingers” (1952), as the Polish love interest of a British spy (James Mason).

Back in France, directors who had grown up adoring Ms. Darrieux clamored to work with her. Claude Chabrol cast her in “Landru” (1963) as one of a Blackbeard-like character’s victims. Jacques Demy’s musical comic drama “Les Demoiselles de Rochefort” (1967) was one of several occasions when Ms. Darrieux played Catherine Deneuve’s mother; among the others was François Ozon’s 2002 all-star musical whodunit, “Huit Femmes” (“8 Women”), about a household with only one man in it, a dead one.

No one ever had to dub Ms. Darrieux’s voice in a movie musical. She recorded and sang dozens of songs onscreen over the decades, most recently Charles Trenet’s “La Folle Complainte” in the 2006 film comedy “Nouvelle Chance,” in which she played an alcoholic.

With and without music, Ms. Darrieux had a long and varied stage career in France, taking on dozens of roles in works by Noël Coward, Françoise Sagan, Feydeau and other playwrights. She played the ultimate older woman in a 1995 French production of “Harold and Maude” and capped her stage career in 2003, at 86, as the star of “Oscar et la Dame Rose,” Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt’s tale of an elderly hospital worker helping a dying boy. She won the Molière, France’s national theater award.

Ms. Darrieux appeared on Broadway twice. In 1970 she replaced Katharine Hepburn in “Coco,” the Tony Award-nominated musical about the fashion designer Coco Chanel. Perhaps more qualified for the role than her predecessor, because she was both French and a singer, Ms. Darrieux was nevertheless in awe of Hepburn. She was, Ms. Darrieux said in interviews, the only person she ever asked for an autograph.

Ms. Darrieux’s only other Broadway appearance was in the short-lived musical “Ambassador,” with Howard Keel, in 1972.

Danielle Yvonne Marie Antoinette Darrieux was born on May 1, 1917, in Bordeaux, France. Her father, Jean Darrieux, an ophthalmologist who was serving in World War I when she was born, died when she was 7. She grew up in Paris, where her mother, the former Marie-Louise Witkowski, gave voice lessons to make ends meet. Danielle studied cello at the Conservatoire de Musique.

She was only 14 when she auditioned for and won a role in the film “Le Bal” (1931), playing an upwardly mobile couple’s neglected daughter whose behavior drives the plot.

Her early stardom was a mystery to her. “Maybe I succeeded because my type wasn’t commonplace on the screen,” she was quoted as saying in “Noir & Blanc: 250 Acteurs du Cinéma Français 1930-1960,” by Olivier Barrot and Raymond Chirat (2000). “I mean that I was simply a young girl, while other 14-year-olds were already playing the vamp.”

In her early film career, she was directed in “Mauvaise Graine” (1934), a drama about car thieves, by a young Austrian immigrant who soon left for Hollywood: Billy Wilder. Aside from her brief Hollywood visits over the years, Ms. Darrieux stayed home, becoming eternally associated with a string of films that remained relatively unknown in the United States, among them “Battement de Coeur” (1940), “Premier Rendez-Vous” (1941), “La Vérité sur Bébé Donge” (1952) and “Marie-Octobre” (1959).

Photo

Ms. Darrieux was a chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur and an officer of the Ordres des Arts et des Lettres, but she never won a César Award, the French equivalent of the Oscar. She received an honorary César in 1985, as if her career were over, but then went on to be nominated twice — for André Téchiné’s “Scene of the Crime” in 1987 (at 70) and for “8 Women” in 2002 (at 85).

She continued acting well into her 90s, making nine films in the first decade of the 21st century. Her last big-screen appearance was in “Pièce Montée” (2010), a comedy about a family wedding. She also appeared in a 2011 television movie, “C’est Toi C’est Tout,” playing a Corsican grandmother.

After her death, France’s minister of culture, Françoise Nyssen, posted on Twitter: “Her talent, her generosity have illuminated the French cinema. Danielle Darrieux knew how to play everything with a prodigious spontaneity.”

Ms. Darrieux was 18 when she married Henri Decoin, a screenwriter and film director who became her mentor. Their divorce in 1941 was so friendly that he directed her in another three films more than a decade later. Her second husband was Porforio Rubirosa, the Dominican-born playboy diplomat who later married the American heiresses Doris Duke and Barbara Hutton. Rubirosa and Ms. Darrieux married in 1942 and remained in France during the Occupation, working for Continental, a German-controlled film company, which led to accusations that she was a Nazi sympathizer. She later said that she had been forced to do the films because of death threats against Rubirosa.

Ms. Darrieux and Rubirosa divorced in 1947. The next year she married Georges Mitsinkides, a Greek-born writer and producer, and they were together until his death in 1991. Her only son, Mathieu Mitsinkides; her brother, Olivier Darrieux, a French comic actor; and her sister, Claude Hussenot-Desenonges, also died in the 1990s, within four years of one another. She is survived by Mr. Jenvrin.

Ms. Darrieux was known for keeping her private life private, and when she gave interviews she tended to be modest. Asked the secret of her successful life in an interview with Cinémotions in 2004, she offered: “I have always put more effort into my private life than my career. I have never let success go to my head, and I never thought it was forever, nor that I was amazing.”

She also exhibited a clear view of reality. “The world is truly bizarre,” she told the weekly magazine L’Express in 1997. “In that context, the role of artists is to bring a little release and pleasure.” She described herself as a woman subdued in her later years, but when asked if she was melancholy, she answered, “But don’t you think everybody is?”

On the other hand, she pointed out, “It is no crime to be happy.”","Danielle Darrieux, French Film Star Over 8 Decades, Is Dead at 100",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/obituaries/danielle-darrieux-french-film-star-is-dead-at-100.html

She has sued the city over a program that provides identification cards to residents, trying to block officials from destroying records that might be used to identify people for deportation.

And she has repeatedly spoken out against a bill that would allow undocumented immigrants to be eligible for state financial aid.

“My father is from Greece, my mother is from Cuba, and I understand very much the aspirations of wanting to achieve the American dream,” she said from the Assembly floor in 2014, in prefacing her opposition to the student aid bill, which she called misguided and unfair.

These days, in campaign visits — to Korean senior centers in Queens, a church in Harlem — Ms. Malliotakis, 36, regularly invokes her family story, but for a different purpose: She knows that it is one of the best ways she can connect with voters in a liberal-minded city where nearly 40 percent of residents are foreign-born.

Her appeal as a child of immigrants may be compromised by her conservative voting record and positions on issues that directly affect many of those same people.

“I, too, am the daughter of immigrants,” said Linda Rosenthal, a Democratic assemblywoman from Manhattan, whose parents fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s. “But when someone says that, at least in the New York City context, your next thought is they relate to other children of immigrants in supporting their attempt to stay in this country, not the other side. So it’s almost like trying to have it both ways.”

Yet the immigrant story is root and branch of Ms. Malliotakis’ political career. Her mother fled Cuba in 1959, shortly after the triumph of Fidel Castro’s Revolution and she instilled in her daughter a fiery hatred of communism, matched by a veneration of American democracy.

And it was her mother, spurred by her passion for her adopted country, who gave Ms. Malliotakis her first push into politics.

Ms. Malliotakis was born on Nov. 11, 1980, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, a week after Ronald Reagan was elected president. The family lived in an apartment on East 56th Street until she was about 2, when her parents bought a two-story house on Staten Island, in Great Kills. Her father worked a variety of jobs; he was a headwaiter at the Chateau Madrid nightclub in Manhattan and operated a string of hot dog carts during the day.

For a while, her parents owned a restaurant called Gyro Snack on East 54th Street. Later, they operated a business importing bibelots from Italy: Capodimonte figurines and Murano crystal. As a teen, during summer vacations, Ms. Malliotakis helped out at the warehouse in Brooklyn.

Her mother, Vera, would often talk about life in Cuba. As a girl, she met Fidel Castro in his guerrilla years, when he came down from the mountains to her town, Contramaestre, to visit friends, bringing along a chicken to cook. He was charming, she said. But things changed when he came to power. The two gas stations that her father owned were seized by the government. Her father stayed, thinking Castro couldn’t last, but Vera and other relatives left the country.

“I understand where my mother came from, not being able to elect your leaders,” Ms. Malliotakis said.

It was her mother, too, who inadvertently set her political career in motion.

“It was my fault,” Vera Malliotakis, 73, joked, speaking in Spanish in an interview in a Staten Island diner. “When Nicole was small, she was shy. I wondered what I could do with her. She didn’t like music, she didn’t sing or dance.”

Her child’s pediatrician suggested that Nicole try acting or sports. Mrs. Malliotakis had a different idea.

“I put her in politics,” she said. “I picked it because I wanted her to talk to people.”

Nicole Malliotakis volunteered to work on the campaign of a candidate for Congress. “She stuffed envelopes, talked to people on the phone, handed out palm cards,” Vera Malliotakis said.

The candidate, Vito J. Fossella, won, and Ms. Malliotakis caught the political bug.

Soon enough, she won a campaign of her own: She was elected senior class president at New Dorp High School on Staten Island, and her friends sensed more was in her future. “Most of us would write in her yearbook something like, ‘Dear Senator,’ or ‘first female president,’” said Salvatore Chieffo, a high school friend.

But it was her own inscription, beside her Class of 1998 portrait, that could serve as a guidepost for her bid to unseat Mayor de Blasio in the Nov. 7 election.

“Be courageous and bold,” she wrote. “When you look back on your life, you’ll regret the things you didn’t do more than the ones you did.”

By her senior year, Nicole Malliotakis had clearly overcome her shyness: In the yearbook of the New Dorp Class of 1998, Nicole was named “class citizen,” “class chatterbox” and “class flirt.”",She’s a Conservative Who Loves Cher.

A line in the dance-theater show “/peh-LO-tah/” hits a timely raw nerve: “The Defender explains why Americans suck at soccer.” When these words flash on the back wall of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theater, they are a biting reminder that the U.S. recently failed to qualify for the next World Cup, and in ignominious fashion at that.

This collision of sports and Milton Friedman may give you an inkling that “/peh-LO-tah/” (the pronunciation for “pelota,” Spanish for “ball”) has more on its mind than a mere ode to scoring goals — though we do see stellar examples on video, along with less inspiring images, such as Zinedine Zidane’s infamous 2006 head butt.

“Why am I putting her through this? Is anybody going to want to read something so awful? I don’t even want to write this story.”

I think I’m becoming the opposite of numb. Each tragedy I’ve covered, each loss I’ve absorbed, has rubbed away a little more of the insulation we all create, or were born with, that keeps the ills of the world safely away. After years of this work, I don’t have much insulation left. Now when I go off on assignment, I’m all nerves.

Even before I met Rajuma, I could barely keep it together. My first day in the refugee camps, watching Rohingya men try to remain dignified as they were herded into lines to wait for a pack of glucose biscuits, made my eyes sting.

I was shocked but soon learned that for decades the Rohingya have been walking around with bull’s-eyes on their foreheads. Scapegoated like the Jews in Nazi Germany, called insects like the Tutsis during Rwanda’s genocide, they are Muslim people in a Buddhist land, dehumanized by their own government and made easy prey.

So I started thinking: If we don’t cover this, that’s even worse. That would be a further injustice, a further insult to the Rohingya’s humanity. It would be like telling Rajuma that the world couldn’t be bothered about what she suffered.

It was very difficult to bring that interview to an end. As we parted ways, what was I supposed to say? In our culture we might say she should “see somebody.” But there were no psychotherapists around and I knew she was headed back to a plastic tarp held up by bamboo poles with nothing to do but think about those moments that I had asked her to conjure up.

I wanted to give her every dollar in my wallet. Or hug her. Or punch someone in the face. This is the worst part of being a journalist: feeling helpless. Not only is there nothing you can do about the horrors in front of you, but in most cases there’s only so much you should do. We are recorders, witnesses, not aid workers. Of course, if Rajuma were bleeding in front of me and needed my help, I wouldn’t hesitate to give it. But that wasn’t the situation here; her baby was dead and she would be traumatized forever.

I stood up and lamely shook her hand and said the only thing that felt close to right:

“Ami dukkhito.”

Of the few Bengali words I learned, those were the ones I used the most. I said them to dozens of Rohingya who lost everything.

Sometimes, it’s the only thing to say.

Some are musicians, some are scientists, all of them are very smart. They’re definitely an erudite bunch, and Mark MacLachlan is no exception: He’s a chemist who was last seen taking us on a cruciverbal roller coaster ride.

In comparison, I bang out words about solving crossword puzzles on a daily basis, and my greatest achievement this week is to try to win a bet with my editor that I can get through an entire column about noble gases without making a joke about breaking wind. Let’s see how long I last.

My point is, we should appreciate our constructors. These people take time out of their busy lives to make puzzles that challenge and entertain us, and they are much smarter than I am, except perhaps when it comes to gas puns.

Yet for much of the last century, until 1994, photography in the city’s rapid transit system was illegal (though it was a spottily enforced offense). In the late 1930s — soon after the city imposed its ban — Helen Levitt, a young Bensonhurst native, apprenticed with Walker Evans as he photographed unsuspecting commuters.

Mr. Evans hoped to capture the “parade of unselfconscious captive sitters,” so to avoid being caught, he painted his 35 mm camera black, tucked it into his coat with the lens poking out from between buttons, and triggered the shutter with a cable release that snaked down his sleeve.

Ms. Levitt’s task? She distracted the passengers.

Not surprisingly, Ms. Levitt was soon taking her own subway portraits, first with Mr. Evans’s gear, and then with her own camera, possibly using the same technique. Though Ms. Levitt moved into cinematography and was eventually nominated for an Academy Award, she would, three years after Mr. Evans died in 1975, return underground to photograph passengers. A new book called, “Manhattan Transit: The Subway Photographs of Helen Levitt,” released by Walther Konig Verlag, compiles photographs from both decades.

It is clear which photographs were taken when, with those from the 1930s featuring art deco posters, elaborate furs, and jauntily-tilted hats, while those from the 1970s had equally elegant sitters, but against the backdrop of graffiti. In some photos, the subjects appear to be looking right at Ms. Levitt, adding further mystery about her technique.

It’s hard to know how she operated, since Ms. Levitt, who died at age 95 in 2009, spoke little of her work. “If it were easy to talk about, I’d be a writer,” she said. “Since I’m inarticulate, I express myself with images.”

11A: Do you get confused as to whether the idiom is “TOE the line” or “tow the line”? A good way to remember that is to visualize a track event where athletes are required to put their toes on the starting line.

17A: I know what you’re thinking, and no, the answer is not the president of the United States. Note that the word “Sun” in the clue “One might stare at the Sun” is capitalized, which means that it’s a proper name. The answer is BALTIMOREAN, because someone from Baltimore is likely to “stare at,” or read, The Baltimore Sun newspaper. And while you are staring, please make sure to read John McIntyre’s blog “You Don’t Say,” an educational and often funny treatise on language, usage and journalism.

40A: When you have made and solved a lot of crossword puzzles, your brain tends to make interesting associations with answers that can be hard to break. For example, as soon as I see the name “Whitney,” I immediately assume that the answer is going to be ELI, the cotton gin inventor. But here’s no Eli Shasta as far as I know, so that’s not right. Today, the abbreviated answer is MTNS.

63A/24D: Wordplay would like to welcome HIS and HER Royal Highnesses to The New York Times.

4D: I’m all for guessing at an answer, but here’s what can happen when you try anticipate an entry based on its letter pattern: I had G_TSBY and was positive that the answer was going to be GATSBY, as in “The Great Gatsby.” That messed me up in the northwest for a while, until I realized that 14A was IVIED, which made 4d the still great GETSBY. Sorry, I meant GETS BY.

10D: Were you pojnted in the wrong direction by the “<—” clue? All you had to do is look at the number of the clue. The answer, like the clue, is TEN.

11D: I was surprised that THINK SMALL just made its debut today. While it’s clued today as “Set one’s sights low,” I always think of the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign from their agency Doyle Dane Bernbach. The campaign launched in 1959, but since I spent some time in the ad agencies of New York City in another lifetime, it’s a campaign I know well because of its effectiveness.

13D: I was not familiar with the word ETEXT, but I suppose if you can have e-textbooks, you can have ETEXT.

32D: For the most part, you are going to see PETRI clued as a vessel for growing bacteria, or its bacteriologist namesake, Julius PETRI. Alexandra Petri, the hilarious ComPost opinion writer at The Washington Post, has become very popular in recent years, and I hope to see her as an alternative clue soon.

46D: ‘The STRATA’ would actually make a really good name for a rock band, so it makes sense to me that the misdirected clue “Rock bands?” has that as its answer.

They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry.
They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.
It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces.
Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area.","Privacy is also good, particularly for tasks that require intense concentration, the thinking goes. That doesn’t mean a return to the glory days of private offices, but it does mean workers have more space and more places to seek solitude than in the neo-Dickensian workbench settings. The new designs often include “isolation rooms,” soundproof phone booths, and even lounges where technology is forbidden.

And it’s meant to be tweaked as needs change. “This continues to be iterated,” said Frank Cuevas, who is working on a major redesign at IBM — and whose use of the word “iterated” hints at the kind of start-up mentality the changes are intended to evoke.

“It’s not something we’re going stop and say, ‘This is it,’” he said.

The corporations setting the new standard are not young Silicon Valley companies known for free food, slides and foosball tables at work — or for carefree spending, as at Apple, whose new corporate mothership cost a reported $5 billion. Nor are the designs one-of-a-kind projects that veer toward eccentricity. Salesforce’s new skyscraper campus in San Francisco, for example, has areas on every floor for meditation, partly inspired by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk.

Instead, the companies behind the emerging new norm in workplace design are a lineup of more staid companies across a range of industries, and they may spend heavily but also systematically. They include Microsoft, IBM and General Electric. Certain workspace innovations may surface first at Google or Facebook, but the older stalwarts are combining and refining them for mainstream businesses.

“These workplace ideas are beginning to be adopted across all industries,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal at Gensler, an architecture and design firm whose clients include Facebook and G.E.

The new designs are not about looks. They are an attempt to adapt to the spread of internet-era digital technology — and its hurry-up ways — into every industry. Space drives behavior, experts say, and the goal of the new designs is to hasten the pace of sharing ideas, making decisions and creating new products. They are also meant to appeal to millennial recruits, many of whom are more comfortable working in a Starbucks than in a traditional office.

The new model eschews the common dogmas of work life: Everybody gets an office, or everyone gets a cubicle, or everybody gets a seat on a workbench. A diversity of spaces, experts say, is more productive, and the new concept is called “activity-based workplace design,” tailoring spaces for the kind of work done.

“Office geography matters, and it can be a key managerial lever to increase communication and the cross-fertilization of ideas,” said Christopher Liu, an assistant professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

One of the most aggressive makeovers is happening at Microsoft, a change forced by business necessity. The company faces a new wave of technology, as the market has shifted to software delivered and constantly updated as a service over the internet cloud, as opposed to being loaded onto individual computers, with the code often stored on compact discs and sold as a product every few years. To compete, Microsoft has had to adopt a faster pace.

“You have to collaborate more,” said Michael Ford, Microsoft’s general manager of global real estate. “We absolutely have to change.”

For decades, the company, based outside Seattle, housed its software engineers in secluded offices, thinking that the privacy helped employees focus while writing computer code. But in 2010, Microsoft started testing open designs with a quarter of a floor, and then expanded. Since 2014, it has opened 10 renovated buildings without offices, including four this year.

Microsoft, Mr. Ford said, has taken a test-and-learn approach. It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to “do a turtle,” researchers say, and retrench and communicate less — colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example

Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. “That’s the sweet spot for Microsoft,” Mr. Ford said.

The company thinks it is working. Microsoft’s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company’s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.

Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.",Don’t Get Too Comfortable at That Desk,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/business/the-office-gets-remade-again.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
