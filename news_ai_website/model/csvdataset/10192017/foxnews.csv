A day after showcasing Republican unity, President Trump is warning a GOP Senator about new attacks.

FOX's Jared Halpern has more from Capitol Hill:

Arizona Senator John McCain warned against half-baked, spurious nationalism in a speech last night, this morning telling reporters his remarks are not specifically aimed at President Trump:

(McCain) ""I was referring to the whole atmosphere and environment around here. This idea that quote America firsters.""

In a radio interview, President Trump warned, at some point, he would fight back and it won't be pretty.

McCain response: that's fine, saying he's faced some fairly significant adversaries in the past.

NEW YORK — OCTOBER 4, 2017 — FOX News Channel (FNC) is expanding the FOX & Friends franchise by one hour, announced Suzanne Scott, president of programming for FNC. Beginning October 9th, FOX & Friends FIRST will be presented from 4-6AM/ET and FOX & Friends will continue in the 6-9AM/ET timeslot. The 4AM hour of FOX & Friends First will be solo-hosted by Heather Childers, while the 5AM hour will be co-anchored by Jillian Mele and Rob Schmitt.

With the expansion of the franchise, FNC now has more women anchoring and hosting programs than any other cable news network on weekdays from 4AM-12AM/ET. Additionally, upon the debut of Fox News @ Night on October 30th, FNC will have live weekday programming for 20 hours a day.

In making the announcement, Scott said, “As FOX & Friends continues to mark its most-watched year in network history, we are thrilled to give our viewers more of the morning franchise they love.”

FOX & Friends FIRST is presented prior to the network’s signature morning show, previewing the day ahead by covering the latest news headlines in politics, business, entertainment and health. The early morning program is the number one cable news program in its timeslot, dominating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers and the 25-54 demographic.

On pace to have its highest-rated year in network history, FOX & Friends has been FNC’s signature morning program for more than 19 years. Co-hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, the show has eclipsed the competition for 190 consecutive months.

The musician appeared on a YouTube video alongside his bandmate, and brother, Brad Fischetti, to announce to fans that a tumor was discovered on the 40-year-old singer’s adrenal gland, which affects his kidneys and heart. In the video, Fischetti notes that the human adrenal gland is supposed to be the size of an acorn, while Lima describes his as “Hulk-sized.”

The video was posted on Wednesday night, announcing a major surgery to remove the tumor on Thursday morning. The duo asked fans for prayers and “positive vibes” as there is a possibility that the surgery could affect his kidney, spleen, part of his colon and more depending on the severity doctors see once inside. Fischetti specifically asked fans to hope that the tumor wasn’t cancer.

While there’s no information about the extent of the surgery or Lima’s recovery, the band’s Twitter page updated fans on how things were going, and the news was positive.

The first House candidate Mr. Bannon has blessed is former Rep. Michael Grimm, who was forced to resign his New York seat in 2015 after pleading guilty to tax fraud. Recently released after seven months in the federal pen, Mr. Grimm will challenge his successor, Rep. Dan Donovan. Presumably Mr. Grimm won’t campaign in his orange prison jumpsuit.

Mr. Bannon has also tried recruiting his first gubernatorial candidate: Colorado’s former Rep. Tom Tancredo, a nativist who once said President Obama was “a more serious threat to America than al Qaeda,” who routinely attacks immigrants for turning America into a “Third World country,” and who earlier this year accepted a speaking invitation from a white-nationalist group.

Mr. Bannon is also throwing support to upstart Senate challengers. In Nevada, where Sen. Dean Heller is up for re-election, Mr. Bannon supports Danny Tarkanian, a perennial candidate who has lost five races for four different state and federal offices. Mr. Tarkanian’s sixth time is unlikely to be the charm.

Continue Reading Below

Taylor met with Trump last Wednesday and he’s become a favorite of Vice President Mike Pence because he believes Taylor represents “sound monetary policy,” according to sources familiar with the matter.

When Pence represented Indiana in the House of Representatives, he tried to rein in the powers of the Fed through a bill that required it to focus only on achieving low inflation and to cut back on the so called dual mandate, which centers on stabilizing prices and maximizing U.S. employment.

A spokeswoman for Pence declined to comment on who the vice president prefers for the job but did say he “has been heavily involved in the process for picking the Fed chair. He and the president will be on the same page when the decision is made.”

Taylor is a professor of economics at Stanford University and served as the undersecretary for the Treasury during President George W. Bush’s first term. He’s also known for a paper he proposed in 1993 called the “Taylor Rule,” which was a recommendation about how nominal interest rates should be determined.

If the Federal Reserve followed the rule, it would raise interest rates when inflation is above target or when GDP growth is too high and above potential. On the other hand, the rule recommends the Fed should lower rates when inflation is below the target level or when GDP growth is too slow and below potential. When inflation is on target and GDP is growing at its potential, rates should remain neutral, according to the model.

Still, even with Taylor being the preference to lead the Fed for Pence, his need to raise interest rates may not sit well with a president who has said in the past he thinks rates should stay low.

“I do like a low-interest-rate policy, I must be honest with you,” Trump said when asked in April about Yellen’s policies on gradually raising rates.

Predict It, which allows participants to bet on who will become the next Fed chair, has Taylor in fourth place under Jerome Powell, Janet Yellen and Kevin Warsh.

Beacon Policy Advisors, a policy research firm out of Washington, D.C., explained to clients in a note on Thursday why Pence and conservatives prefer Taylor to replace Yellen while insisting that it will likely be Powell, a current Fed governor, who will get the job.

“A favorite of conservatives, including Vice President Pence, Taylor checks the list of accomplishments in academia, experience in Republican administrations, and espousal for a more hawkish monetary policy. Taylor's stricter adherence to systematic rules for raising interest rates does not mesh with Trump's view of keeping interest rates low to bolster asset prices though. However, optics matter more than policy for the president. Our base case is that Trump chooses Powell as chair and Taylor as vice chair, but vice-versa is also a possible outcome,” the note said.

The decision on whether or not Yellen will stay on as chair could come as early as Friday, according to those who are part of the discussions, and, if not, Trump is leaning toward deciding next week.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is focusing on the informant amid scrutiny of the 2010 approval of a controversial uranium deal with a Russian company. He’s raising questions about potential “conflicts of interest” for Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration, and especially wants to know whether the committee that approved the deal was aware of the FBI probe involving a subsidiary of the same Russian firm.

On Thursday, President Trump called the issue “your real Russia story” and said “it’s a disgrace” that the “fake news won’t cover” it.

The deal in question, which was previously reported, involved the 2010 approval of a partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company. The U.S. was involved because the sale gave the Russians control of part of the uranium supply in the U.S.

TRUMP BLASTS 'FAKE MEDIA' FOR IGNORING URANIUM DEAL STORY

Grassley wrote in letters last week to federal agencies that he’s not “convinced” by previous “assurances” that there were no unresolved national security concerns, and revealed Thursday that he wants to hear from the FBI informant in the Russia corruption probe.

“Witnesses who want to talk to Congress should not be gagged and threatened with prosecution for talking. If that has happened, senior DOJ leadership needs to fix it and release the witness from the gag order,” Grassley said in a statement.

Victoria Toensing, a lawyer for the former FBI informant, told Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” that her client has “specific information about contributions and bribes to various entities and people in the United States.”

She said she could not go further because her client has not been released from a nondisclosure agreement but suggested the gag order could be lifted soon. Toensing also claimed that her client was “threatened by the Loretta Lynch Justice Department” when he pursued a civil action in which he reportedly sought to disclose some information about the case.

In a letter sent Wednesday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Grassley said such an NDA would “appear to improperly prevent the individual from making critical, good faith disclosures to Congress of potential wrongdoing.”

He asked for a copy of the NDA by Nov. 1 and requested that, should one exist, “you release him from it and pledge not to engage in any form of retaliation against him for good faith communications with Congress.”

Sessions separately sent a letter to Toensing asking to set up an interview with the former informant. Grassley wrote, “It appears that your client possesses unique information about the Uranium One/Rosatom transaction and how the Justice Department handled the criminal investigation into the Russian criminal conspiracy.”

The Hill reported earlier this week that the FBI had evidence as early as 2009 that Russian operatives used bribes, kickbacks and other dirty tactics to expand Moscow’s atomic energy footprint in the U.S. Grassley on Wednesday released a series of letters he fired off last week to 10 federal agencies, raising the question of whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which approved the uranium transaction was aware of that FBI probe -- and pointing to potential “conflicts” involving the Clintons. The committee included then-Secretary of State Clinton.

It had been previously reported that figures tied to the transaction gave donations to Bill Clinton and his family foundation, but Grassley wrote that he has learned additional details about a $500,000 fee the former president got from a Russian investment bank for a June 2010 speech. He wrote that the bank’s senior officers include former Russian intelligence personnel, and sources had described the company as an “extension” of the Russian government.

“Notably, in the same month as the Clinton speech, Uranium One and Rosatom notified CFIUS of the Russian government’s intent to acquire 20 percent of the United States’ uranium assets. The next month, in July 2010, Renaissance Bank reportedly assigned Uranium One a ‘buy’ rating, a move that would principally benefit its Russian investors,” Grassley wrote. “The donations raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest for Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration.”

As noted in The Hill, the feds did eventually go after Vadim Mikerin, a Russian nuclear industry official, in connection with the investigation. He was later sentenced, in 2015, to 48 months in prison in connection with money laundering allegations.

When details of the Uranium One deal first emerged in 2015, Clinton’s campaign downplayed the allegations.

""No one has produced a shred of evidence that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State in order to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation,"" a spokesman said at the time. ""To suggest the State Department, under then-Secretary Clinton, exerted undue influence in the U.S. government's review of the sale of Uranium One is utterly baseless.”

On Wednesday, social media users all over the globe blasted a series of billboards and television commercials for Nivea’s new Natural Fairness moisturizer, marketed to women living in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Senegal, The Sun reported.

In the campaign, as the former Miss Nigeria Omowunmi Akinnifesi applies the moisturizer, her skin turns noticeably lighter.

“I need a product that I can really trust to restore my skin's natural fairness,” Akinnifesi says. “Now I have visibly fairer skin, making me feel younger.”

Across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, users started sharing the hashtag #PULLITDOWNNOW to protest the ad and petition for its removal.

“This is why black businesses need to rise up and cater for our needs. Nivea can’t get away with pushing this skin lightening agenda across Africa. Appalling,” tweeted British entrepreneur William Adoasi.

Others chimed in with similar outrage, noting the ""very dangerous issue of colorism"" and questioning the meaning ""overactive melanin"" in the moisturizer’s product description.

However, there is a demand for skin-lightening products throughout Africa, Metro reports. According to a recent study by the University of Cape Town, about 75 percent of Nigerian women use skin lightening products, which are also popular in Ghana, Senegal and Kenya, according to the site.

Damning new evidence appears to show that Hillary Clinton used her office as Secretary of State to confer benefits to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband.

But there’s more. It seems it was all covered up for years by the same three people who are now involved in the investigation of President Donald Trump over so-called Russian “collusion.”

The incriminating evidence was uncovered by The Hill (John Solomon and Alison Spann) and Circa News (Sara Carter). Their dogged reporting reveals that the FBI gathered a multitude of documents, secret recordings, intercepted emails, financial records, and eyewitnesses accounts showing that Russian nuclear officials directed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bill Clinton during the very time that Hillary Clinton presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia.

The corrupt scheme is said to have been financed by the Russians through bribes, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering. The FBI and the Department of Justice reportedly had the evidence in their possession before the uranium sale, but kept the matter secret and never notified Congress which would surely have stopped the transfer of uranium to Russia.

Indeed, the entire sordid affair remained hidden for seven long years. Until now.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

Criticism of the Electoral College was resurgent in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss. Clinton recently said she wants the system ""eliminated."" The latest effort isn’t aimed at dismantling the structure entirely – but rather, the winner-take-all system used by 48 states in awarding electors, which ends up focusing presidential races on a handful of battlegrounds.

“With a winner-take-all, most of America is ignored,” professor Lawrence Lessig said in previewing his legal case – which, like any challenge to the Electoral College, faces a steep uphill climb.

Lessig, though, argues the system violates the 14th Amendment’s one-man-one-vote principle. Currently, all but two states award all electors to the winner of the state’s popular vote. Lessig said 24 people have volunteered to be plaintiffs, though he’s still deciding which states to focus on.

“We are looking for a Republican from a blue state whose vote never counts and a Democrat from a red state whose vote never counts,” he said.

Lessig, who was very briefly a Democratic candidate for president for the 2016 cycle, insists this isn’t a partisan endeavor and will consist of at least two separate lawsuits. If he were to beat the odds and prevail, the kind of overhaul he seeks could have mixed results -- theoretically allowing Democrats to pick up electoral votes in deep-red territory and Republicans to win electors in deep-blue states like California and New York.

While it would require a constitutional amendment to ditch the Electoral College for a national popular vote system, the Constitution does not mandate how states award electors. Maine and Nebraska actually divvy up electors by congressional district. Donald Trump picked up one Maine elector in 2016 and Barack Obama won a Nebraska elector in 2012.

Another alternative—which Lessig prefers—would be a proportional system, where a losing candidate could still get a percentage of the state’s electors based on the popular vote.

Lessig contends other proposals, such as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, could take decades to fully implement. By contrast, a court ruling could force states to move to a proportional system by 2020.

Lessig, meanwhile, warns that election results that defy the popular vote could become more common.

“Two of the last three presidents were inaugurated without winning the popular vote,” he noted, referring to Trump’s victory in 2016 and George W. Bush’s in 2000. It has happened in just three prior elections: 1888, 1876 and 1824. “The number of times the Electoral College doesn’t conform with the popular vote will go up given the demographics,” Lessig predicted.

'The Supreme Court could knock this out.' - Election lawyer Roger Austin, casting doubt on an Electoral College court challenge

The current system undoubtedly concentrates campaign spending. Just 14 battleground states saw 99 percent of ad spending and 95 percent of candidate visits for campaign purposes in 2016, according to Equal Citizens.

David Boies, who was the lead counsel for former Vice President Al Gore in the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case in 2000, and Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics attorney under President George W. Bush, are part of the legal team for the case.

But the system has its defenders.

Gary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University and author of “Haywire: A Chronology of the 2016 Presidential Contest,” said it provides stability.

“Under a district plan, we could see a number of third-party candidates emerge, competing for a narrow portion of the vote by just running in congressional districts,” Rose told Fox News. “A proportional system would be a recipe for France, a multi-party system, with a plethora of small parties that are hardly bigger than an interest group.”

Interestingly, fear of third parties brought Congress to its closest point of scrapping the Electoral College. After third-party candidate George Wallace won 46 electoral votes in 1968, the House of Representatives voted 338-70 in 1969 to abolish the Electoral College and require the winner to a presidential election to carry at least 40 percent of the vote. The proposed constitutional amendment was blocked by a Senate filibuster.

While candidates visit only a handful of swing states now, Rose said, under a national popular vote system, presidential candidates would ignore smaller states.

“A national popular vote would be a detriment to the American people, and many voters would really feel disenfranchised if the campaign moved only to the urban areas,” Rose said.

Proving standing for the litigation could pose a challenge depending on which court hears the cases, added Roger Austin, an election lawyer and former general counsel for the Florida Republican Party who also questions the case’s legal merits.

“The Supreme Court could knock this out as a political question that they do not want to tackle or leave to the political branches,” Austin told Fox News. “The court has ducked a lot of cases this way.”

Trump won 306 electoral votes in 2016 to Clinton’s 232, though Clinton won a plurality of the popular vote, with 48.5 percent to Trump’s 46.4 percent. The irony might be that Trump could still have triumphed under a reformed system.

Under a district plan, Trump would have won 290 electoral votes, according to an analysis by the website 270toWin.com. The analysis found under a proportional system, Trump would have won 267 votes to Clinton’s 265. A third party would have gained six electoral votes, sending the matter to the House of Representatives.

But Lessig’s own analysis of a proportional system found Clinton winning the needed 270 to Trump’s 267.

While technically looking ahead to future elections, Lessig hasn’t quite given up on the last one. He recently penned a Medium post imagining a scenario where Trump is impeached, eventually leading to House Speaker Paul Ryan becoming president – and then handing the presidency to Hillary Clinton.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business.
How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business?
Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does.
It’s a genuine investment that will pay dividends – for your family business, yes, but more importantly, for your family’s sense of belonging.","Just last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intention to dedicate an extra $144 million towards fighting the opioid crisis – a decision which, while helpful, is long overdue. Substance abuse, and opioid abuse in particular, continues to wreak havoc on this country. Ninety-one Americans die each day from opioid abuse, and drug offenders make up the large part of our nation’s incarcerated population.

It’s a health care problem, it’s a criminal justice problem – but it’s also a family problem, and it’s one that is especially challenging for families who run a family business. I’ve spent all of my life and much of my career observing and advising family businesses, and time and time again I’ve seen that substance abuse plays a large role in the sad fact that 70 percent of family-owned businesses don’t make it past one generation. The collateral damage when a family business falls apart extends to the employees, the stockholders, the lenders, the suppliers, the customers, and even the tax base and economic health of the entire community.

And, economic consequences aside, addiction has deep emotional consequences and can destroy what is an otherwise healthy family business. A longtime friend of mine recently confided in me his sorrow over his two sons, both of whom had been doing wonderfully in college – until they discovered alcohol and quickly become addicted.

My friend tried putting his sons in treatment programs, but it didn’t work. He tried tough love, but his kids wound up hating him. His business prospered, but today his children won’t speak to him. He can’t hand his business on to them, his hoped-for legacy is in tatters, and much of what gave his life meaning has vaporized. What good, he asks himself, does it do to succeed financially and fail as a family?

I was deeply saddened by my friend’s story, but even more saddened to learn that he’s not alone.

One study found that more than half of family businesses had or were struggling with an addiction issue within the family. This may sound shocking, but it stacks up with other statistics: One in ten Americans have struggled with some kind of drug abuse and one in eight with alcohol abuse. Many American families don’t know whether their life’s work will live beyond them into the next generation or whether addiction and substance abuse will have the final say.

So – what to do? How to create a substance-free family culture that can sustain a family business? How to avoid heartbreaking situations like the one my friend found himself in?

There’s no one single answer, and even among healthy families, things will look different. But I’ve generally found that among the families that last, three core values were emphasized:

Be clear. Make no bones about the fact that substance abuse is not what your family does. Parents have far more influence than they know. According to Joe Califano, former Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter and the founder of the Center on Addiction and Substance (CASA), “Parent power is the greatest weapon we have to curb substance abuse.”

He encourages parents to emphasize that substance abuse is not simply illegal but seriously dangerous, and to take the same attitude towards it that they do towards asbestos. Most parents would be in an uproar if they found out their child’s school has asbestos, but are willing to let substance abuse in school slide. And kids respond to this kind of clear condemnation: Those who know their parents would be “very upset” are more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol than those who know their parents would only be “a little” or “not upset at all.”

Be together. Oftentimes, risky behaviors result from unloving homes. When children do not feel loved and valued by their parents, they are far more likely to look for love elsewhere – and oftentimes, that means succumbing to peer pressure to win admiration and acceptance.

Simply spending time together – without screens and without distractions – will increase family bonding and a child’s sense of worth and belonging. CASA found that teens who eat dinner with their parents fewer than three nights each week are more susceptible to smoking, drinking and drug abuse than those who eat with their parents five nights or more each week.

Be fun. Teach kids early on that you can have fun and be creative without substances. If they see you getting creative and enjoying yourself without alcohol and drugs, they’re less likely to turn to those things as a way to have fun.

Whatever you do, whether it be sports, board games, arts and crafts, or music, it’s important to intentionally set aside time to do it.

These things are important for all families that want to develop a strong family culture – but they are especially important for parents who themselves come from families that struggle with substance abuse. Creating a stable family is particularly hard when you have genetics and family patterns working against you – but not impossible.

Dr. Falk Lohoff, a scholar at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, argues that “While genetic factors can increase the risk of becoming addicted, they are not deterministic.

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

Once that happens, blood no longer circulates to the brain, which means brain function halts ""almost instantaneously,"" Parnia said.
Recent studies have shown that animals experience a surge in brain activity in the minutes after death.
And people in the first phase of death may still experience some form of consciousness, Parnia said.
They find a new meaning to life having had an encounter with death,"" Parnia said.","Driven by ambition and curiosity to learn what lies on the other side of death, five medical students deliberately stop their hearts in order to experience ""the afterlife"" in the new thriller ""Flatliners"" (Sony Pictures), which opened in U.S. theaters on Sept. 29.

They quickly discover that there are unexpected and terrible consequences of dallying with death — but not everything they experience after ""dying"" is in the realm of science fiction. A growing body of research is charting the processes that occur after death, suggesting that human consciousness doesn't immediately wink out after the heart stops, experts say.

But what really happens in the body and brain in the moments after cardiac arrest?

The terms ""cardiac arrest"" and ""heart attack"" are frequently used interchangeably, but they are not identical conditions, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). During a heart attack, a blocked artery prevents blood from reaching a portion of the heart, which can cause that section to die — though the heart continues to beat, the AHA explained.

INSURER ALLEGEDLY SEND COVERAGE DENIAL LETTER TO 9-MONTH-OLD WITH BRAIN CANCER

During cardiac arrest, the electrical signals driving the heart's pumping action are disrupted, the heart ceases beating and death shortly follows, the AHA said.

In the vast majority of terminal cases, physicians medically define death based on when the heart no longer beats, said Dr. Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation research at NYU Langone School of Medicine in New York City.

""Technically speaking, that's how you get the time of death — it's all based on the moment when the heart stops,"" he told Live Science.

Once that happens, blood no longer circulates to the brain, which means brain function halts ""almost instantaneously,"" Parnia said. ""You lose all your brain stem reflexes — your gag reflex, your pupil reflex, all that is gone.""

A trajectory of cell death

The brain's cerebral cortex — the so-called ""thinking part"" of the brain — also slows down instantly, and flatlines, meaning that no brainwaves are visible on an electric monitor, within 2 to 20 seconds. This initiates a chain reaction of cellular processes that eventually result in the death of brain cells, but that can take hours after the heart has stopped, Parnia said.

Performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) does send some blood to the brain — about 15 percent of what it requires to function normally, according to Parnia. This is enough to slow the brain cells' death trajectory, but it isn't enough to kick-start the brain into working again, which is why reflexes don't resume during CPR, he said.

""If you manage to restart the heart, which is what CPR attempts to do, you'll gradually start to get the brain functioning again. The longer you're doing CPR, those brain cell death pathways are still happening — they're just happening at a slightly slower rate,"" he told Live Science.

Recent studies have shown that animals experience a surge in brain activity in the minutes after death. And people in the first phase of death may still experience some form of consciousness, Parnia said. Substantial anecdotal evidence reveals that people whose hearts stopped and then restarted were able to describe accurate, verified accounts of what was going on around them, he added.

""They'll describe watching doctors and nurses working; they'll describe having awareness of full conversations, of visual things that were going on, that would otherwise not be known to them,"" he explained. According to Parnia, these recollections were then verified by medical and nursing staff who were present at the time and were stunned to hear that their patients, who were technically dead, could remember all those details.

Death and beyond

Parnia and his colleagues are currently investigating the pervasiveness of consciousness after death. They're looking at large numbers of people in Europe and the United States who have suffered cardiac arrest, in the largest study of its kind, he said.

""In the same way that a group of researchers might be studying the qualitative nature of the human experience of 'love,' for instance, we're trying to understand the exact features that people experience when they go through death, because we understand that this is going to reflect the universal experience we're all going to have when we die,"" he said.

The study researchers are also observing the brain in detail during the period of cardiac arrest, death and revival to understand how much oxygen is reaching the brain, when exactly the cortex comes ""back online"" and how these experiences relate to brain activity itself, Parnia added.

For these scientists, the most important next steps are finding more accurate methods of monitoring the brain from beyond the threshold of death and improving the quality of resuscitation, to do a better job of preventing brain injuries while restarting the heart, Parnia said.

""At the same time, we also study the human mind and consciousness in the context of death, to understand whether consciousness becomes annihilated or whether it continues after you've died for some period of time — and how that relates to what's happening inside the brain in real time,"" Parnia said.

The ""Flatliners"" movie also suggests that death and resuscitation could enhance normal brain activity after revival, as the students who ""died"" and woke up can suddenly remember obscure passages in long-forgotten books. However, in the real world, a return ticket from death doesn't include newly acquired cerebral superpowers — though it does frequently provide a new perspective on life, Parnia noted.

""What tends to happen is that people who've had these very profound experiences may come back positively transformed — they become more altruistic, more engaged with helping others. They find a new meaning to life having had an encounter with death,"" Parnia said.

""But there isn't like a sudden magical enhancement of their memories,"" he added. ""That's just Hollywood jazz.""

November 2007 arrest

The former child star was arrested after allegedly refusing to leave a Chicago Walgreens while seemingly intoxicated, People reported in December 2007. Though LaBeouf was charged with trespassing, the charge was dropped because Walgreens declined to press charges, the report said.

LaBeouf later called the incident “complete and utter insanity” and “a mistake I’m still completely embarrassed about.”

March 2008 warrant

LaBeouf was ticketed for unlawful smoking while on a sidewalk in February 2008 in Burbank, Calif., and a bench warrant was issued after the actor didn’t attend a hearing, the Los Angeles Times reported. LaBeouf’s attorney was in court one day later, and pleaded not guilty for his client. The charge was dropped and LaBeouf was fined $500, the report said.

July 2008 DUI arrest

LaBeouf was involved in an early morning crash in California in which he injured his hand. Police arrested him on a drunken driving charge. Authorities said the actor wasn’t at fault, as another driver had run a red light.

In September 2008 a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said that there wasn’t enough evidence to charge LaBeouf.

SHIA LABEOUF APOLOGIZES FOLLOWING RACIAL RANT DIRECTED AT POLICE OFFICER

2011 bar fights

LaBeouf was reportedly punched in the face by a man at a bar in Sherman Oaks, California, in February 2011. Police handcuffed both men, who each decided not to press charges, the Hollywood Reporter said. In October 2011, LaBeouf was struck by a man on a sidewalk in Vancouver, Canada. The man and Shia earlier may have ""got into it"" in a bar, TMZ reported.

Alleged rape comes to light, 2014

LaBeouf told Dazed and Confused magazine in its Winter 2014 issue that a woman raped him at his #IAMSORRY performance art show in Los Angeles in February 2014, where guests could meet him on an individual basis.

“One woman who came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened, whipped my legs for ten minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me,” LaBeouf recalled. He claimed the woman “walked out with dishevelled hair and smudged lipstick.”

“As soon as we were aware of the incident starting to occur, we put a stop to it and ensured that the woman left,” LaBeouf’s collaborators Luke Turner and Nastja Säde Rönkkö tweeted in early December 2014.

February 2014 paper bag incident

LaBeouf made headlines for when he walked out of a Berlin Film Festival news conference for “Nymphomaniac Volume I.” At the film’s premiere, he wore a tuxedo - plus a paper bag on his head. The bag had openings for his eyes and featured the words “I am not famous anymore.”

June 2014 arrest

LaBeouf was watching a performance of the musical ""Cabaret"" at a New York City theater when he began to smoke cigarettes, yell at actors, and swear at security guards, according to court papers.

He had faced multiple charges, and would eventually plead guilty to disorderly conduct in November 2014 in a deal with no jail time or probation. A prosecutor said the deal was made because the star had “been in continuous treatment since his arrest.”

October 2015 arrest

LaBeouf was in Austin, Texas, in October 2015 when he was arrested in the city’s Sixth Street district for public intoxication around 7:30 p.m., Austin police said. He was booked into jail and released on his own recognizance.

“Obviously he gets arrested a lot, he came down here, he acted up and APD doesn’t put up with that,” Ben Blake, who saw the actor’s arrest, told KXAN. “So he got what he got, you know?”

“He Will Not Divide Us” project launch and arrest, January 2017

LaBeouf's live stream project at the Museum of the Moving Image, called “He Will Not Divide Us,” began on January 20, the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. It invited participants to say “He Will Not Divide Us” in front of a camera set up outside.

LaBeouf was arrested outside the museum on January 25. He had yanked a man’s scarf, scratching his face in the process, and also shoved him, according to authorities. Assault and harassment charges were later dropped, the New York Post reported.

The museum shut down the project, saying Feb. 10 that it “resulted in an unexpectedly volatile situation and serious public safety hazards.” The installation was moved to Albuquerque, N.M., where it was vandalized, and was eventually taken on by the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology in Liverpool, the project website says.

April 2017 incident

Video showed LaBeouf yelling at bartender David Bernstein and calling him ""racist,"" according to the Hollywood Reporter. Bernstein had reportedly refused to serve the actor alcohol.

Bernstein later sued LaBeouf. LaBeouf's lawyer has argued that LaBeouf's comments were free speech.

July 2017 arrest

LaBeouf was arrested early July 8 in Savannah, Georgia. At about 4 a.m. that day, LaBeouf had asked a police officer and bystander at an intersection for a cigarette, Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan police said.

“When LaBeouf wasn’t given a cigarette, he became disorderly, using profanities and vulgar language in front of the women and children present,” authorities wrote. “He was told to leave the area and refused, becoming aggressive toward the officer.”

LaBeouf fled to a hotel when the officer tried to arrest him, and he was taken into custody in the lobby, police said.

At a police station, LaBeouf was caught on camera telling a black police officer that he was “going straight to hell, straight to hell, bro.” LaBeouf later said the man would go to hell “because he’s a black man.”

In a statement posted to Twitter, LaBeouf said, “I am deeply ashamed of my behavior and make no excuses for it.”

LaBeouf appeared before a Recorder's Court judge on Oct. 19. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction and will spend the next year on probation. He also pleaded no contest to a charge of disorderly conduct. Prosecutors dropped a charge of public drunkenness.

His plea deal requires anger management counseling, and he must also complete a drug and alcohol evaluation.

The 40-foot tall memorial became known as the ""Peace Cross.""

In 2014, the American Humanist Association -- a group that believes in ""being good without a god"" -- filed a lawsuit alleging the cross-shaped memorial is unconstitutional and demanding it be demolished, altered, or removed.

They alleged the cross carries ""an inherently religious message and creates the unmistakable appearance of honoring only Christian servicemen.""

On Wednesday, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and ruled the historic memorial must be torn down -- all because the Bladensburg Memorial is in the shape of a cross.

The Fourth Circuit said the memorial excessively entangles the government in religion because the cross is the “core symbol of Christianity” and “breaches” the wall separating church and state.

Writing separately, Chief Judge Gregory wrote, “This Memorial stands in witness to the VALOR, ENDURANCE, COURAGE, and DEVOTION of the forty-nine residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland ‘who lost their lives in the Great War for the liberty of the world.’ I cannot agree that a monument so conceived and dedicated and that bears such witness violates the letter or spirit of the very Constitution these heroes died to defend.”

Mike Pompeo said the U.S. is threatened by other militant groups as well.

""IS' capability to conduct an external operation remains,"" Pompeo said. ""But I wouldn't put them in a singular bucket. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has for a long time had this mission statement, which includes the taking down of a commercial airliner bound for a western country. Certainly, among those would be the United States.""

Speaking a day after President Donald Trump's acting homeland security chief invoked the possibility of another 9/11-style attack, Pompeo said America's enemies around the world ""are intent upon using commercial aviation as their vector to present a threat to the West."" However, he also worried about a terrorist capability ""we just don't see.""

The typically blunt threat assessment came during a wide-ranging discussion at a Washington think tank, in which Pompeo also underscored President Donald Trump's intent to counteract North Korea. He said Pyongyang is only months away from perfecting its nuclear weapons capabilities.

""They are closer now than they were five years ago, and I expect they will be closer in five months than they are today, absent a global effort to push back against them,"" Pompeo said. ""From a U.S. policy perspective, we ought to behave as if we are on the cusp of them achieving that objective.""

On another nuclear concern, Iran, Pompeo stressed that Trump wants to ensure the U.S. foe has no pathway to developing the bomb. To that effect, he said, the Iran nuclear deal President Barack Obama and America's allies negotiated with Iran was insufficient.

The notion that the agreement would ""curtail Iranian adventurism or their terror threat or their malignant behavior has now ... two years on, proven to be fundamentally false,"" said Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas who keenly opposed to the seven-nation accord when it was reached.

He said the Iran deal put the United States in a better place with respect to inspections of Iranian facilities. But from an intelligence perspective, he said, even more ""intrusive inspection"" is needed.

""The Iranians have on multiple occasions been capable of presenting a continued threat, through covert efforts to develop their nuclear program along multiple dimensions ... the missile dimension, the weaponization effort, the nuclear component itself,"" he said.

Trump has provided the CIA with the authority it needs to track Iran's compliance with the deal, he said.

Pompeo also said it's an ""open secret"" that Iran has links to al-Qaida.

""There have been relationships, there are connections. There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside al-Qaida,"" Pompeo said. ""There have been connections where, at the very least, they have cuts deals so as not to come after each other.""

Pompeo and Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who also spoke at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies event, both said the U.S. must counter Iran's aggression in the region. They noted Iran's support for the Lebanon's Hezbollah militants, who threaten Israel; backing of Shia militias in Iraq and Syria; cyber activities; ballistic missile efforts; and a long history of proliferation ties with North Korea.

Pompeo said Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps controls as much as 20 percent of the Iranian economy. McMaster said the United States needs to raise the cloak on the IRGC's financial network and urge companies worldwide not to do business with it.

""Don't enrich the IRGC,"" McMaster said. ""Don't enable their murderous campaign. Don't enable their threat to our friends in the region, especially Israel, but also Saudi Arabia and others.""

Pompeo also discussed Pakistan's help in getting an American woman, her Canadian husband and three children released last week from the Haqqani militant network.

It's been almost two weeks since the Las Vegas massacre. 59 people were killed, nearly 500 injured and investigators are still baffled by motive... or lack of one...

""We don't know yet what the motive is, but that's not for lack of trying."" FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Thursday. ""And if you know anything about the Bureau, we don't give up easy.""

But there are also questions about the timeline of the massacre. This week Las Vegas law enforcement said it appeared the suspect Stephen Paddock opened fire on a Mandalay Bay security guard six minutes before he opened fire on the concert. The guard Jesus Campos was checking out a door alarm down the hall from Paddock's room when he was hit in the leg by gunfire.

MGM has issued a statement refuting that. That the timeline was constructed earlier, but they now believe shots were being fired at the concert at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the security guard first reported shots were fired.

“Volcanic eruptions may have had a central role in the eventual collapse of the Ptolemaic dynasty,” the journal noted in a summary.
The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C.
Both periods of turmoil, the researchers found, coincided with major volcanic eruptions.
“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.","Sun-choking debris cast off by volcanoes more than 2,000 years ago starved headwaters feeding the Nile river and hastened the downfall of ancient Egypt’s last kingdom, researchers claim.

Eruptions in the 3rd and 1st century B.C. — including one of the biggest blasts in the past 2,500 years — coincided with crop failures, large-scale revolts and the withdrawal of Egyptian armies from the battlefield, they reported in the journal Nature Communications.

Up to now, researchers had struggled to find an explanation for these events.

“Volcanic eruptions may have had a central role in the eventual collapse of the Ptolemaic dynasty,” the journal noted in a summary.

The findings, the authors said, also highlight the risk today of climate engineering schemes that would combat global warming by injecting billions of tiny particles into the stratosphere — just like a volcano — to block some of the sun’s rays.

Even if so-called solar radiation management lowers the planet’s temperature a notch or two, it could inadvertently cause major disruptions in rainfall patterns.

“Ptolemaic vulnerability to volcanic eruptions offers a caution for all monsoon-dependent agriculture regions,” which today include 70 percent of the world’s population, the authors wrote.

The Ptolemaic empire began in 305 B.C., shortly after the death of Alexander the Great, and ended in 30 B.C. with the suicide of Cleopatra. After that, the region became a Roman province.

The kingdom mostly thrived, nourished by the silt-rich Nile overflowing its banks in summer across a far-flung network of grain fields. An ingenious system of channels and dams stored water after the river receded in September.

VIOLENT UPRISINGS

“When the flood was good, the Nile Valley was one of the most agriculturally productive places in the ancient world,” said Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College Dublin and co-author of the study.

But in some years, the river failed to rise, and trouble followed. Why this happened was not known.

Drawing from climate models, Greenland ice cores, and ancient Egyptian writings, researchers led by Joseph Manning of Yale University pieced together a narrative that showed an unmistakeable link with major volcanic eruptions around the world.

In 245 B.C., for example, the ruler Ptolemy III suddenly, and inexplicably, abandoned a successful military campaign against his arch nemesis, the Seleucid Empire, centred in present-day Syria and Iraq.

“This about-face changed everything about Near East history,” Manning said.

Historical records also pointed to simultaneous food shortages due to insufficient flooding of the Nile, as well as violent uprisings in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which stretched across northeast Africa and parts of the Middle East.

A similar confluence of social upheaval, disease and starvation struck the empire in its final two decades.

Both periods of turmoil, the researchers found, coincided with major volcanic eruptions.

From more recent records, scientists know that the tens of millions of tons of sulphur dioxide particles ejected into the upper atmosphere by a major eruption can prevent monsoon weather from moving far enough north of the equator to thoroughly soak the Ethiopian highlands, the headwaters of the Nile.

This happened in 939 when Eldgja, in Iceland, blew its top, and again in 1783-84, when Iceland’s Laki erupted.

The Islamic Nilometer, a log of Nile water levels since 622, showed a corresponding impact on the river.

“The volcanic eruptions didn’t cause these (social) upheavals on their own,” Ludlow said.

“But they likely added fuel to existing economic, political and ethnic tensions.”

The New York-based low-cost carrier said the move to terminate its relationship with 12 OTAs will mark the first part of a new “online distribution strategy.” Going forward, the airline will focus on booking directly through its own website as well as “select third-party channels,” which includes Expedia, Travelocity and Priceline.

JetBlue said direct bookings will save the company third-party transaction fees, which it said will allow the airline to keep ticket prices low, while still allowing customers access to promotions and fare sales, including ones that might not be available through the OTAs.

HOW IT WORKS

OTAs rely on fare and flight data that comes from global distribution systems (GDS), such as Amadeus and SABRE, in order to sell tickets for flights. The fees airlines pay for using such services can range between $3 and $5, according to Michael Boyd, president of Boyd Group International, an aviation consulting firm.

Mike Julianelle runs the Instagram account Got Toddlered, where he shares memes and photos featuring “things children have ruined.” But as it turns out, his kids have affected not only his household and his old way of life, but his appearance as well.

FATHER SUPPORTS BREASTFEEDING PARTNER WITH HILARIOUS, SWEET GESTURE

On Oct. 12, Julianelle shared side-by-side photos of himself. One was from 2006, before he had kids, and it shows him looking youthful and rested. In the other one, from 2016, Julianelle appeared unshaven and exhausted.

“Wanna see something REALLY scary? Here’s me, before and after I had kids!” he wrote alongside the images.

The father of two, who has a seven-year-old and almost two-year-old, told HuffPost that after sharing the picture, he got a message from a follower suggesting he ask for submissions from other parents, as well. So Julianelle encouraged everyone to share their “scariest ‘Before and After Kids’ pics” for him to post on the account.

“Let the nightmares begin!” he wrote.



Julianelle has since shared over a dozen before-and-after photos. He said he’s received far more of those submissions than any of the “my toddler destroyed something” memes he previously got.

“Obviously, it’s meant to be lighthearted, and no one is seriously blaming their children for the state of their faces or lives, except for me when I seriously blame my kids for the state of my face and my life, which is basically all I do on my blog and Facebook page and Twitter,” he told HuffPost.

He said he hopes the pictures make people laugh and let parents know they aren’t alone in feeling overwhelmed.

“My blog and everything else have always been about the fact that it’s OK to be honest about the pitfalls of parenthood,” Julianelle said. “There’s no shame in admitting that for all the peaks, there are plenty of pits. Kids are the worst best thing that’s ever happened to us and if we don’t laugh about the havoc they wreak we’d have to cry instead, and I’m not a crier.”",Dad's viral side-by-side photos show what kids do to you,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/18/dads-viral-side-by-side-photos-show-what-kids-do-to.html

It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.","A California bill which prohibits pet stores from selling dogs, cats or rabbits unless they are rescues was approved by Gov. Jerry Brown last week.

The bill requires pet stores to obtain the animals from “a public animal control agency or shelter, society for the prevention of cruelty to animals shelter, humane society shelter, or rescue group … that is in a cooperative agreement with at least one private or public shelter.”

The bill's passage makes California the first state to ban the sale of animals from so-called puppy mills or mass breeding facilities, according to the Associated Press.

Below are some some other things California has banned or might soon.

Plastic bags

California became the first state in the U.S. to ban single-use plastic bags in 2015, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Businesses that continue to offer the bags have to charge customers a fee.

Travel

California blocked state-funded travel to multiple states in June that had what the state attorney general considered anti-LGBT policies. Those states were: Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas.

Non-essential state-funded travel was already banned from Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Certain pets

California bars the possession of certain “restricted animals” without a specific permit, including hamsters, ferrets and gerbils.

Hedgehogs, certain parakeets and piranhas are also banned from being kept as pets.

Cars with internal combustion engines

Cars with internal combustion engines could soon be banned in California.

Mary Nichols, the California Air Resources Board chair, told Bloomberg that Gov. Jerry Brown is interested in a potential ban. However, she said banning cars with internal combustion engines wouldn’t happen in the next 10 years.

Foie gras

California’s foie gras ban was reinstated in September by a federal appeals court. It found that a state law preventing sales of the food product made by force-feeding ducks and geese was not preempted by federal authority to regulate poultry products.

The ban was signed into law in 2004 after proponents said the process of fattening the birds’ livers was cruel and inhumane. The law took effect in 2012, but was blocked by a court in 2015, delighting chefs who wanted to serve it.

The decision won’t immediately go into effect.

Motive can illuminate a lot when evidence is missing, and that is why even courts consider motive so strongly.

On President Trump's call to fallen soldier La David Johnson's wife, the president's motives are important...

Either the president called to wish the wife well, and to give her America's condolences, or the president called to antagonize a fallen soldier's wife.

When you consider the motive of the accuser, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., there is a long history of evidence that could be considered to point to her motive to bring down this president.

Logic dictates that the president wouldn't simultaneously make a call to console and hurt a grieving military wife. It simply doesn't make sense.

But more importantly, fame is a great motivator. Most Americans, if surveyed, would say that they have never heard of Congresswoman Wilson before now, despite her many attempts to throw outlandish accusations at President Trump. There is a history of attention-getting behavior that has not worked. (For instance, she has repeatedly called for Trump's impeachment and has called him mentally ill.)

For those desperately seeking attention, when their tactics to fill their appetite for attention don't work, they seldom give up. Ordinarily, they take it to a new level.

When the Congresswoman was privy to part of a conversation she could exploit for her well-documented purpose of getting attention on the back of the president, she may have seen this as her ticket to her fifteen minutes of fame.

Since she made the accusation that the president said that fallen soldier Johnson ""knew what he signed up for"" (as if somehow insinuating that he deserved death for his decision), she has had a lot of attention.

The only problem: The motivations don't add up in her favor.

Her history of desperate, attention-seeking tactics, using the president, present an illuminating case in favor of the president.

Logic dictates that the president wouldn't simultaneously make a call to console and hurt a grieving military wife. It simply doesn't make sense.

Neighbors tell KABC-TV that the woman who lived nearby may have been in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend. They're afraid she may have tried to harm herself and the children.

Initially, Kelly said he instructed the president not to make the phone call.","White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said Thursday he was “stunned” and “broken-hearted” after a condolence call President Trump made to the widow of a slain soldier turned into a public and political spectacle pitting the administration against a Democratic lawmaker.

In a rare and emotional moment from the White House briefing room podium, Kelly condemned Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., for listening to that phone call and then criticizing the president's tone in the press.

“I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning and broken-hearted, at what I saw a member of Congress doing -- a member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the president"" to the widow, Kelly told reporters.

“It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation, absolutely stuns me. … I thought at least that was sacred,” he said, blasting what he called Wilson's ""selfish behavior.""

Kelly, whose son Second Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in battle in Afghanistan in 2010, said he was so shocked by the escalation of events that he went to Arlington National Cemetery to take a walk.

The Trump call in question was made to the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, one of four Americans killed in an ambush in Niger on Oct. 4.

Wilson within hours went to the press to criticize Trump for allegedly saying during that phone call that ""he knew what he signed up for,"" claiming the remarks were insensitive.

Trump denied it, while Wilson stood by her account.

Kelly on Thursday seemed to back up part of Wilson's account, but sought to put the president's words in the proper context -- while blasting Wilson for listening to the conversation at all.

Kelly said Trump was trying to say something akin to what Gen. Joseph Dunford, now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him when his own son died: That ""he was doing exactly what he wanted to do … he knew what he was getting into.""

Soon after Kelly's remarks, Wilson responded.

""Let me tell you what my mother told me when I was little. She said 'The dog can bark at the moon all night long, but it doesn’t become an issue until the moon barks back',"" Wilson told reporters.

Trump ignited a political controversy over how presidents interact with Gold Star families earlier this week after he questioned whether former President Barack Obama called the families of fallen troops during his eight years in office. This was as he faced questions about his administration's response to the Niger ambush.

Obama did call and write letters to families of some fallen soldiers, though Kelly said Thursday that Obama did not call him when his son died. However, he stressed that he did not say that as a ""criticism"" of Obama.

When Trump called Johnson's widow 12 days after the attack, Wilson later spoke to the media and criticized his choice of words.

Jeffrey Gonzalez, a self-described paranormal expert, said he heard about the sighting from a local farmer who said he saw the creature and five others running on his ranch near Avocado Lake.

“One of them, which was extremely tall, had a pig over its shoulder,"" Gonzalez said in comments obtained by Fox 26, a Fox News affiliate. ""And the five scattered and the one with the pig was running so fast it didn’t see an irrigation pipe and it tripped, with the pig flying over.""

'BIGFOOT' REPORTEDLY SPOTTED IN NORTH CAROLINA FOREST

According to his Facebook page, Gonzalez is a talk show host and an investigator at Paranormal Central, in addition to being a technician at AT&T. He also founded the Sanger Paranormal Society.

Gonzalez said that the sighting is not that uncommon, with three additional Bigfoot sightings in the past five years, all located in East Fresno County.

“I would have never guessed in a million years that you would have told me there were Bigfoot on Shields or Ashlan Avenue. Right? So, I want to know what’s going on. Is this for real?” Gonzalez added.

He recounted two others stories, including one from a woman who said her two sons saw a Bigfoot in their orchard and one from a man who saw five creatures in the same orchard.

“What are the odds of three people, three different families, who don’t know each other, within a radius of 2 to 3 miles, come and tell me what they witness, and it matches up,” Gonzalez said.

The images are reminiscent of the famous Patterson-Gimlin film footage from the 1960s.

In fact, the Kansas State University researcher tells National Geographic that when he first broached with alligator experts the question of whether alligators eat sharks, some of them thought he was kidding.

Nifong wasn't, and he found that in addition to the expected prey —crustaceans, fish and wading birds, per his study in Southeastern Naturalist — he documented alligators eating a lemon shark, a nurse shark and a bonnethead shark, along with an Atlantic stingray.

This, even though sharks and rays are not freshwater creatures.

Nifong explains it's not uncommon for sharks to enter freshwater, where ""opportunistic alligators"" then pounce. GPS trackers also found the gators wade into estuaries where the two types of water mix, and where shark nurseries can be found.

But it may be a two-way street. Says Nifong, it's ""really about size dynamic.

“Fast-forward to today, now I turn on the TV and the gentlemen are kneeling,” he added. “I know I’m not diminishing their cause, but there’s just no justification to disrespect our national anthem and the men and women who served in the armed forces.”

Wilson said Trump told Army Sgt. La David Johnson’s pregnant widow that he “knew what he signed up for…but when it happens, it hurts anyway.” Johnson was killed earlier this month during an attack in Africa.

But Wilson has often voted against legislation that would help veterans and their families, according to a vote-tracking website.

What is the feud between Wilson and Trump?

Army Sgt. La David Johnson and three other service members died in an Oct. 4 attack in Niger. Islamic militants ambushed the soldiers.

Wilson said she was riding with Myeshia Johnson, the soldier's widow, as they went to Miami International Airport to meet his body when Trump called. The president said Johnson “knew what he signed up for … but when it happens, it hurts anyway,” Wilson said.

The congresswoman called the remark “so insensitive” during an interview with WPLG-TV.

The fallen soldier’s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, told the Associated Press Wednesday that the congresswoman’s account was correct.

Trump denied Wilson’s claims in a tweet Wednesday.

“Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!” he tweeted.

FAMILIES OF FALLEN HAVE MIXED EXPERIENCES WITH TRUMP, IF ANY

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Wilson’s criticism “appalling and disgusting” and accused her of “politicizing” the issue. She said the call wasn’t recorded but other White House officials, including chief of staff General John Kelly, were present during the call.

But Wilson hasn’t backed away from her claim and later said that Myeshia Johnson told her Trump “didn’t even remember his name.”

""I was stunned when I came to work, when I saw what a member of Congress was doing, listened in on a phone call from the president,"" Kelly said Wednesday.

""It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation…I thought at least that was sacred,"" he said.

A spokeswoman says Wilson had no comment on Kelly's remarks about her Thursday.

What has Wilson’s voting record on veteran’s issues been?

VoteSmart.org, a site that tracks voting records, shows that Wilson hasn’t supported several measures that would have helped veterans and their families – including financially.

Specifically, she opposed a measure that would have given the families of four soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan in 2013 death and burial benefits.

TRUMP SAYS DEM REP 'FABRICATED' ACCOUNT OF CALL TO SOLDIER'S WIDOW, HAS 'PROOF'

She has also opposed measures to reform the embattled Department of Veterans Affairs.

And Wilson has voted against measures multiple times that would ensure veterans and their families would still receive benefits despite government shutdowns.

What else do we know about Wilson’s political career?

A former elementary school principal, Wilson was elected to Congress in 2010. She previously served in the Florida State Senate from 2002-2010 and the State House of Representatives from 1998-2002.

Her House of Representatives website lists several issues of concern, including education, gun violence, health care, immigration and jobs.

When it comes to Social Security, Wilson says that she ""will vote against any measure to privatize the program, cut benefits, or increase the eligibility age.""

This year, Wilson voted against the Republican health care bill.

In February 2015, she sponsored a bill that was introduced on what would have been Trayvon Martin's 20th birthday. The bill called for the House to press ""any State legislature to reject or repeal Stand Your Ground legislation.""

What about her personal life?

Her husband, Paul Wilson, died in 1988 after their three children were born, according to a Miami Herald profile.

In addition to her three children, Wilson also has five grandchildren, her House bio says.

She’s also spoken several times about her attire, specifically her penchant for wearing unique hats.

""It all started with my grandmother, whose name was Frederica also. She wore hats and gloves. I just wanted to be like her, so I started wearing hats. I just like to dress up, I guess, and I got that from her,"" Wilson told Roll Call in 2012.

“I’ve never counted, but I've been wearing them almost 30 years,” Wilson told Politifact in 2010. ""It's almost like a fetish. ... I have hundreds.”

While other colleges and universities offer classes or certificates in marijuana policy and law, Northern Michigan breaks ground to offer the first four-year degree dedicated to the science and business of growing marijuana.

Canfield was inspired to design the curriculum after attending the American Chemical Society’s annual meeting last year and hearing about the need for analytical chemists.

University officials believe that the program fills a growing need. To date, 29 states have legalized medical marijuana, including the eight states where marijuana is also permissible for recreational use, Fox 6 Now reports.

Lauded for its gorgeous mountain setting, commitment to sustainability and strong sense of community, it’s logical that Boulder citizens would be happy people. The city is also famed for his frontier history, and serves as the home to the main campus of the University of Colorado.

It's not too crowded, either. The population of Boulder — settled in 1858 — currently rests at about 108,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months,"" Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom. We dedicate this night to you and everyone who has experienced loss or tragedy in the last few months.""

Aldean closed out the night with a defiant and rollicking group performance of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty with Urban, Stapleton and Little Big Town.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single ""Fast,"" and Stapleton singing his song ""Broken Halos,"" a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad ""H.O.L.Y."" and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song ""Blue Ain't Your Color.""

Phillip Phillips added some blues licks to Sam Hunt's mega hit ""Body Like a Back Road,"" which was named song of the year by CMT.

Near the end of the night, Bryan took a moment to honor his friend Aldean.

""It could have been any one of us standing on that stage two weeks ago,"" Bryan said. ""It's a nightmare that nobody should have to face. Jason has responded with dignity, care, respect and, some ways, defiance. And we all proud of him, especially me.""

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

Furthermore, the Riverfront Times of St. Louis reports that the “drunk” man has yet to be criminally charged for causing a disturbance aboard the flight, despite police and EMS workers being called to deal with him upon arrival.

WOMAN SAYS DELTA AIR LINES PREVENTED HER FROM SINGING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The incident originally took place aboard a flight from St. Louis to Denver on June 10, though footage of the altercation was only shared on YouTube earlier this week. In the video, the man can he heard using profanity and repeatedly telling Cannon — who is black — that he was “pulling his white card” when she asked to be re-seated.

WARNING: Footage contains profane language. Viewer discretion is advised.

Cannon told the Riverfront Times that she first saw the unidentified man drinking in the airport terminal while flirting with the redheaded woman who was later seated to his left. Aboard the flight, she says Frontier continued to serve him alcohol despite being visibly drunk. Cannon also says he continued flirting inappropriately with the redheaded woman, telling her how he wanted to take her to the plane’s restroom, and describing the size of his penis. He also began rubbing his crotch area, she says.

""When he described his penis size, I couldn’t take it no more,” said Cannon. ""I told [the flight attendants] what he’d said.”

Cannon alleges that a flight attendant came by and told the man he was no longer allowed to order alcohol, which prompted him to turn to the redheaded woman and say, ""Don't worry, I have white privilege, I have a white card.""

""I went from zero to a million,” remembers Cannon. “I looked at him and I said, 'You’re a racist son of a b----.'”

AIR BERLIN FLIGHT MAKES STRANGE MANEUVER, SPARKING SAFETY PROBE

In the above footage, subsequently captured by Cannon, the man can be heard repeating that he’d be “pulling his white card” after Cannon told the crew to “get him away from me.”

Cannon also told the Riverfront Times that she was moved to a different seat, but that the man continued arguing with flight attendants.

Police were called to meet the flight upon arrival, at which point they subdued the man, Cannon says.

""He kept screaming, 'I'm a business owner, I'm a business owner,'"" she told the Riverfront Times. ""He wanted everybody to know that he is a business man and he had white privilege and a white card. He was flailing and fighting everybody.""

Later, inside the terminal, Cannon says she met a woman who claimed to have captured footage of the unidentified man being rolled through the airport on a gurney.

Cannon’s lawyer later received a letter from the airline apologizing for the incident. However, Frontier wrote that they felt the crew’s actions “were appropriate for the situation and regret any discomfort caused to Ms. Cannon.” They also issued her a $250 flight voucher.

No, not Trump. His name is Andrej Babis and by this time next week, he will probably be the prime minister of the Czech Republic, which holds elections this weekend.

This is another chance for Europeans to tell the European Union to stop trying to run their lives. It happened earlier this month in Austria, where 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz led his right-of-center party to victory, and in Germany, where an anti-immigrant party posted a surprisingly strong second-place showing. If Czech voters do what the polls predict, they will join Poland and Hungary in electing a leader who opposes the E.U.’s encroachment on the rights of its member states.

There is no surer sign that Babis and his Ano party are gathering steam than a New York Times headline calling him “a new threat to European unity.”

As in those countries, increasing numbers of citizens are tired of being told what to do by Brussels. They don’t want to adopt the euro, preferring their currency, the koruna. They don’t want to take in more immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, as Germany’s iron-willed chancellor Angela Merkel has mandated for the past two years. Merkel got her comeuppance in her country’s national elections, where her Christian Democrats came in first but garnered far fewer votes than it did in 2013.

The Czech Republic, which spent decades decaying behind the Soviet-era Iron Curtain, flourished in its early years of political independence. But the worldwide economic meltdown in 2008 convinced Czechs that their traditional parties were corrupt and too willing to take orders from the E.U.

Like President Trump, Babis is a wealthy businessman, and he has earned his share of detractors. He has been indicted on criminal charges of misusing European Union funds during his time as finance minister. His tax returns are also under intense scrutiny. So far, those flaws have not cut into his popularity, according to recent opinion polls.

The technology that has amplified the private citizen also amplifies the corporate executive, the tech-savvy oppressor, and the billionaire dilettante with political aspirations. Everybody hates Amazon. It’s kind of weird. Donald Trump, as a candidate, threatened to bring antitrust actions against Amazon and accused the Internet retailer of dodging taxes, and as president Trump has taken a special interest in the company’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, which offends Trump by reporting on his antics from time to time. “Believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems,” he said. “They are going to have such problems.”

Torrey Twane McNabb, 40, has challenged the humaneness of the state's lethal injection procedure. He was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 6 p.m. CDT, but the Supreme Court granted a stay after McNabb's attorneys filed a flurry of appeals. The justices could still decide Thursday night to go ahead with the execution.

McNabb was convicted in the 1997 shooting death of Montgomery police Officer Anderson Gordon. Prosecutors say McNabb was fleeing a bail bondsman when he walked up and shot Gordon five times while the officer was sitting in his parked patrol car.

McNabb and several other inmates have challenged the state's use of midazolam at the start of lethal injections, arguing that it violates Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment because the sedative would not reliably render them unconscious before other drugs stopped their lungs and heart.

A lawyer for McNabb has argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabb's lawsuit.

The attorney general's office has asked justices to let the execution proceed. The state has argued they have allowed multiple executions to proceed using the sedative midazolam and that McNabb presents ""nothing new"" to justify halting the execution.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.
Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

Clowns have always been a traditional, albeit time-consuming and slightly strange Halloween costume, but amid a rash of reports of evil jesters cropping up across the country, such outfits are getting close scrutiny.
These were just two incidents of creepy clown sightings across the U.S last year with “killer clowns” popping up everywhere from Florida to Colorado and leading many schools to not clown around with Halloween costumes.
“If anyone shows up with a clown related costume, they will be asked to change or sent home.”","It’s that time of the year again, when the leaves turn, the air becomes crisp and Americans of all ages don masks and costumes to hit the streets in search of sweets, shindigs and maybe a bit of mischief.

But as the U.S. gears up for Halloween, young people are finding that their outfit choices are becoming increasingly limited as institutions from grade schools to major universities clamp down on controversial costumes.

From creepy clowns to Caitlyn Jenner outfits, schools across the country have in recent years issued everything from warnings to bans on costumes that could be construed as inappropriate, publicly incorrect or culturally insensitive.

“This obnoxious undertaking of public shaming is perpetrated by a temperamental culture who engages in it simply to avoid looking at its own inconsistency and ugliness for one more day,” comedian Jim Norton wrote in an opinion piece for Time. “True tolerance would be encouraging people to dress up on Halloween however they wish and if they make fools out of themselves, they would hopefully learn from the embarrassment.”

Tufts University last year threatened investigations by campus police against any student whose costume was deemed offensive, especially if the outfit is thought to be culturally appropriated or “relating to tragedy, controversy, or acts of violence.” Some costumes that have fit that description in the past include geishas, Native Americans, Confederate soldiers or anything involving wearing blackface and/or a sombrero.

The University of Texas handed out a 29-point checklist for avoiding offensive costumes, as noted by The College Fix. It included any “generalized representation” of Asian culture or “Indigenous” cultures, such as “Cowboys and Indians.”

St. Thomas University in Minnesota recently distributed a flier outlining “unacceptable” costumes that included, “Wearing Native American headdresses, dressing up as a ‘Mexican’ by wearing a sombrero, dressing as a ‘geisha,’ any form of blackface.”

Princeton University has planned a seminar with students to “engage in a dialogue about the impact of cultural appropriation, Halloween, and why culture is not a costume.”

While the warnings by universities – some of which are also offering counseling to offended students and encouraging them to report offensive costumes – are nothing new and are meant to create a more tolerant environment, some critics question how far is too far.

“One wonders what’s left,” Robby Soave, an associate editor at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank, wrote last year in the Daily Beast. “Many students who heed the above guidelines are presumably restricted from dressing up as samurais, hombres, geishas, belly dancers, Vikings, ninjas, rajas, French maids, Bollywood dancers, Rastafarians, Pocahontas, Aladdin, Zorro, or Thor.”

Soave added: “Garden-variety Halloween costumes — vampires, zombies, etc. — would seem to run afoul of the prohibition on ‘tragedy and acts of violence.’ And this year’s topical costumes — Harambe, Cecil the Lion, Donald Trump — invoke controversy, so they’re out, too.”

Disaffected minority groups are only one part of the costume crusade. Another type of outfit that schools have taken issue with are ones that are just in bad taste.

The company HalloweenCostumes.com recently pulled an outfit of Holocaust victim Anne Frank from its website after it was hit with a slew of criticism.

“There are more appropriate ways to commemorate the legacy of Anne Frank than through a Halloween costume, which is offensive and trivializes her suffering and the suffering of millions during the Holocaust,” Alexandra DeVitt, a spokesperson for the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, told Fox News. “We are pleased that the costume has been pulled.”

From costumes of murdered teenager Trayvon Martin or ones of Caitlyn Jenner to Bill Cosby groping a woman or Donald Trump grabbing a woman in her private parts, any outfit that addresses rape or violence is a no-go. Some grade schools have gone so far as to ban superhero costumes or ones where a child carries a toy weapon.

“We send out letters a few weeks before Halloween telling parents that their children cannot wear masks or bring weapons of any kind to the school,” said Kenneth Smith, the principal at Strathmore Elementary School in Aberdeen, N.J., told the New York Times. “We know that kids are kids…but times have changed.”

Then there are the creepy clown costumes.

Clowns have always been a traditional, albeit time-consuming and slightly strange Halloween costume, but amid a rash of reports of evil jesters cropping up across the country, such outfits are getting close scrutiny.

Two clowns were spotted in Greenville, S.C., last year trying to lure a young boy into the woods. Later a knife-wielding clown was arrested for allegedly chasing a teenager through a New York City subway station. These were just two incidents of creepy clown sightings across the U.S last year with “killer clowns” popping up everywhere from Florida to Colorado and leading many schools to not clown around with Halloween costumes.

“I am asking for your cooperation in not allowing your children to dress up as clowns at any school event due to the possible disruption and fear it may cause,” Ron Bolandi, the interim superintendent of schools in Montclair, N.J., said, according to the Guardian. “If anyone shows up with a clown related costume, they will be asked to change or sent home.”","Halloween costume crackdown: Schools ban creepy clown, culturally insensitive outfits",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/18/halloween-costume-crackdown-schools-ban-creepy-clown-culturally-insensitive-outfits.html

Some public schools will reopen next week, more than a month after Hurricane Maria swept over Puerto Rico, though dozens of buildings were destroyed and others are still being used as refugee centers, education officials said Thursday.

The U.S. territory's 345,000 public school students have been out for more than a month. Education officials say classes will begin at schools in two regions Tuesday — Mayaguez and San Juan. Teachers will arrive a day earlier.

Classes for students in two other regions, Bayamon and Ponce, will begin Oct. 30. It's not clear yet when schools in the rest of the island's seven regions will open. About 80 percent of the island is still without power, though 71 percent has water service now.

There are more than 1,100 schools in the system, but at least 70 were too badly damaged to re-open. Roughly 190 are open as community centers, where students can go until noon, and dozens more are housing about 5,000 people who lost their homes in the devastating storm.

Education Secretary Julia Keleher has said she would like to get students back to class as soon as possible, but she is balancing many different priorities, including safety, repairs, teachers' needs, and finding homes for those staying at the schools.

At least 30,000 students have left for the United States, but some of those are attending private schools, and education officials say they aren't sure how many will return once classes resume on the island.

So hydrogen fuel cells could dramatically reduce fuel costs.","A team of Army researchers did not set out to prove that human pee could fuel U.S. military vehicles and bases in the future — but their unexpected urine discovery could transform how the armed forces get energy in the field.

A U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) team at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland believes it has discovered a way to use urine to provide power.

Soldiers can be required to carry more than 80 pounds on a typical 72-hour mission, and more than 15 pounds of those pounds can be batteries.

Could this urine discovery reduce the load a soldier carries by a whopping 20 percent?

In future war zones, soldiers may be using their own urine to produce electricity for the devices they need on the move — from drones and night vision devices to laptops and communications equipment.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

While urine could be used to power devices and greatly lighten the load for soldiers, fuel cells could also be used on a much, much larger scale like powering vehicles and theoretically even entire bases.

Why urine?

It is the hydrogen in the urine that Army scientists are keen to exploit to yield power.

They get the hydrogen by adding the ARL team’s special aluminum nano-powder to the urine, igniting a chain reaction that releases hydrogen.

In under three minutes, one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the powder can produce 220 kilowatts of power from urine, researchers say.

AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR'S SHOW

Hydrogen is important because it has enormous potential to power fuel cells.

With hydrogen harvested from urine as fuel, the fuel cell yields electricity as well as water and heat, all three of which could be utilized by the military.

How do fuel cells work?

Fuel cells work like batteries. They contain chemicals and the chemicals are converted into electricity. With hydrogen fuel cells, the process of converting hydrogen and oxygen into water produces the electricity.

But fuel cells are different to batteries in the sense that they do not go dead or need to be recharged.

As long as there is hydrogen harvested from urine or elsewhere, the fuel cell will deliver endless electricity.

But why is pee important?

Why the excitement over this urine and hydrogen discovery? After all, hydrogen is one of the most common elements and can come from a range of sources.

AUSA 2017: THIS MILITARY ATV CAN 'THINK' AND DRIVE ITSELF

Hydrogen fuel cells could greatly lighten the load for soldiers so they would not have to carry battery weight anymore. But they need fuel for the hydrogen fuel cell.

One thing a soldier would always have access to in any war zone, anywhere in the world, no matter how remote and isolated ... is urine.

So this discovery could help pave the way to constant, easy access to fuel and power.

From Polaris MRZR ATVs to tanks, hydrogen fuel cells could be a future source of fuel. As far as military vehicles go, another fuel cell advantage is that they generate electricity quietly. By reducing noise, it could help reduce detection by enemy forces and enable a stealthier approach.

Again, with the fuel accessibility of urine, soldiers would always have easy, immediate access to fuel to potentially power a motorcycle or a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).

AUSA 2017: THIS NET MAKES US SPECIAL OPERATIONS VEHICLES 'DISAPPEAR'

In some ways, Forward Operating Bases bear certain similarities to the International Space Station. Resources are very limited and resupply can be challenging since they are remote and difficult to access.

Energy is a vital resource there to keep critical tech powered.

If urine could be converted to provide fuel, then the base would have constant access to energy.

To resupply fuel to a base, soldiers can be exposed to threats like IEDs and attacks by enemy forces. With immediate access to an endless power supply through urine, fuel cells could put an end to the need to resupply conventional fuels and therefore reduce the risk to U.S. soldiers.

PODCAST: HOME DEFENSE AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILY LIKE THIS SOF SURVIVAL EXPERT

Other advantages to fuel cells

Hydrogen fuel cells are a very clean, efficient and effective way to produce electricity. If fuel cells can be cracked, they could truly revolutionize power for the military.

AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES

They are more energy-efficient than combustion engines — they can convert the fuel chemicals to electrical energy up to about 60 percent more efficiently, according to the Department of Energy.

It is also far cheaper to use urine as fuel rather than JP-8, diesel and other conventional fuels used in war zones. So hydrogen fuel cells could dramatically reduce fuel costs.

They also yield far lower emissions than their combustion engine counterparts. The only emission is water. While benefiting from the efficiency and cost reduction, the military could help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and air pollutants.

Discovery? The pee advantage

While the Army scientist team was working on developing materials and tech to improve capabilities for soldiers, they developed a special new nano-galvanic aluminum-based powder. When the powder comes into contact with water, it yields pure hydrogen.

But it doesn’t just work with water. Tests revealed that when the powder was added to lots of different liquids with water it also yielded hydrogen.

ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'

Their research was already important. And then they made an additional discovery — an unexpected one.

The Eureka moment? Urine.

With urine, there was a twofold increase in the reaction rates. So when the special powder was added to urine, it produced hydrogen far faster than even water.

What’s next?

The team is continuing to advance and also looking at how other fluids readily available to a soldier downrange could be harnessed — including saliva.",Will combat vehicles use urine for fuel?,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/19/will-combat-vehicles-use-urine-for-fuel.html

Leaver said that Myers eventually apologized, but it was “not enough,” and she has heard he harasses women on a regular basis.

“The apology is weak, and only inspired by public humiliation and fear of consequence. This is a Weinstein microcosm,” Leaver wrote. “Anyone else who has been harassed by this man, or any other, I stand by you. Over and out.”

Myers, who deactivated his Twitter account after Leaver started tweeting her story, is a known feminist who has written stories such as, “Men’s rights activist are cave dwelling idiots.” In the 2015 story, Myers wrote, “There is a new, global group dedicated to undermining significant social change. They wear the mask of an online avatar and use technology to harass, threaten and silence their targets. Their cause? To prevent steps towards the equality of men and women. They are the ‘Men’s rights activists.’”

Daily Caller reporter Ian Miles Cheong had harsh words for Myers, tweeting, “Male feminists who claim the moral high ground, who turn their noses up at the ‘misogynists’ below, are the very demons they claim to fight.”

Myers also has written stories mocking President Trump, declaring that there is “no such thing” as an illegal immigrant and bragged about being photographed with the alleged writer of the infamous Russian dossier of Trump information.

Sadly, this is one of those rare issues in which people of every political ilk can find common ground. This issue is not about liberals or conservatives, race or religion. It’s about something deeper and more primal.

Hollywood in all its excesses is, of course, the perfect incubator for the worst in human behavior. The Harvey Weinstein story is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s my hope that Hollywood’s Pandora’s Box is open, because of the brave women who have come forward to tell their stories. Yet it’s not only the women who have suffered at the hands of powerful men.

Child actor Corey Feldman has courageously spoken out against the culture of pedophilia in Hollywood. He said it wasn’t only him, that his friend Corey Haim was raped as a child. Yet, while he wouldn’t “name names,” he maintains that one of his attackers is a prominent person who still works in the Hollywood business today. This is only the beginning of the offenses in the entertainment industry. I hope Corey starts naming names soon.

Sadly, this is one of those rare issues in which people of every political ilk can find common ground. This issue is not about liberals or conservatives, race or religion.

But then again, the law wasn’t designed to improve the nation's health care system - it was designed to sabotage and undermine health care as we knew it.
President Trump was right to restore law and order to our health care system.","If you’ve turned on the news and heard any of the outrage from Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and others on the left accusing President Trump of “vast, pointless sabotage,” you might assume that the president had repealed the Affordable Care Act last week through executive fiat.

Hysteria makes for a nice messaging tactic, but facts are stubborn things. Let’s put the House and Senate minority leaders’ talking points aside and look at what’s really happened with this executive order.

For starters, President Obama’s “cost sharing reimbursements” (CSR’s) to insurance companies were illegal. The executive branch cannot allocate money that Congress hasn’t appropriated. Avik Roy wrote a piece in Forbes this weekend that appropriately characterized President Trump’s decision to end CSR payments as “not a health policy decision, but rather a constitutional one” because “it is simply illegal for the federal government to spend money that Congress hasn’t authorized it to spend.” David French also outlined this idea in National Review when he said, “They [the CSRs] were never lawful because Congress never appropriated the money.”

It’s ironic Pelosi and Schumer are accusing the president of sabotaging ObamaCare given the fact that they were the ones who sabotaged our nation’s health care by passing ObamaCare in the first place, before even knowing what was in it.

Ultimately, this alone should be enough to justify the president’s decision. It was not a “sabotage” of ObamaCare, as Schumer and Pelosi called it. It simply restored the rule of law by undoing the unconstitutional actions of the Obama administration.

But looking at Pelosi and Schumer’s accusations in context, it’s ironic they are accusing the president of sabotaging ObamaCare given the fact that they were the ones who sabotaged our nation’s health care by passing ObamaCare in the first place, before even knowing what was in it.

Remember: ObamaCare was sold on false promises that could never be kept. Recall what they told us in order to sell this bill: If you like your health care plan, you can keep it; if you like your doctors, you can keep them; premiums will go down – and for families they’ll go down by an average of $2,500; deductibles will go down; emergency room visits will go down.

All of these assertions were false. Seventy-five percent of the ObamaCare-created state health care co-ops have gone out of business. Premiums have gone up drastically. Deductibles have risen. People lost their health care plans and couldn’t keep their doctors. This law made health insurance costlier and it made the business of offering it riskier.

Sadly, such deception was knowingly used to sell this disastrous health care law. Jonathan Gruber, who the New York Times called the “architect of ObamaCare,” told us as much when he said, “Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical to get for the thing to pass.”

It’s difficult to explain your motives any more clearly than that.

But then again, the law wasn’t designed to improve the nation's health care system - it was designed to sabotage and undermine health care as we knew it. Former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told us as much when he was asked in 2013 whether the country would have to have a health care system that “abandoned insurance as the means of accessing it.” His answer? “Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.”

So let’s be honest about what has happened here: Democrats, led by Pelosi and Schumer, rammed through a government takeover of health care that was nothing more than a leap toward single-payer health care deceptively sold as a market-based solution. And as the system collapsed, it has become evident that ObamaCare, through skyrocketing premium increases and taxpayer-funded CSRs, was designed to fail. Now that it’s failing, they’re blaming Republicans and calling for single-payer.

The Pelosi and Schumer outrage is baseless, but the American people’s outrage is not. They elected President Trump because they are tired of politicians who say one thing and do another. They’re tired of their elected officials making promises and then abandoning those commitments once they get in office. That must end. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it well: If you’re not strong enough to do what you said and vote to repeal ObamaCare, you don’t deserve to stay in office.

President Trump was right to restore law and order to our health care system. And he was right to remind Congress that Americans are tired of inaction, and want us to repeal ObamaCare. Now it’s the Republican Party’s turn, and we must deliver on our promise. Failure would be truly outrageous.

Today, even though its mechanical body has been vaporized, the information it sent back during its time in orbit continues to surprise scientists. The most recent example of this is a newly-discovered quirk with Saturn's atmosphere which researchers are struggling to explain.

During Cassini's daring trips between Saturn and its iconic rings, the spacecraft's powerful mass spectrometer picked up a puzzling mix of chemicals that made NASA's scientists scratch their heads. The most likely explanation? Saturn's gorgeous rings are shedding.

Cassini's discovery wasn't just blind luck; NASA's earlier missions, dating back to the 1970s, provided data that suggested Saturn's upper atmosphere was littered with bits of ice, and scientists believed it was coming off of the planet's rings. In an effort to test that theory, Cassini checked it out for itself, finding not water but methane and potentially carbon monoxide. Other unidentified molecules were also detected, and scientists are still trying to isolate what exactly they could be.

The concentrations of these chemicals are greater near the planet's equator, which points once again to the possibility that the material is raining down on Saturn from its own rings. That makes sense, but there are still some very puzzling questions that haven't been answered, including the process by which the particles depart from the rings and find their way to the planet's atmosphere.

""We have a lot of work to do to understand how they are getting in there,"" Planetary scientist Mark Perry of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory explains. ""None of the models predict this.""

It's a completely unexpected discovery, and one that will surely lead to further theories about how Saturn and its rings behave. Without Cassini there to provide further data, answers might he hard to come by.

A new AAA study found that 28 percent of new cars sold today aren’t equipped with a spare tire. Many automakers have eliminated spare tires to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency in recent years, replacing them with repair kits or run-flat tires.

But according to Consumer Reports, that number is down from 36 percent last year, due to an increase in the sales of trucks and SUVs, which are more likely than cars to come with a spare.

Nevertheless, AAA reports that it responded to over 450,000 emergency calls last year from motorists who suffered flat tires and didn’t have a spare. The organization says many were surprised at the discovery, which can aggravate an already harrowing event.

To avoid this situation, AAA recommends that new car shoppers always ask if the car they’re interested in comes with a spare, which is sometimes offered as an option. If not, owners should learn how to use their repair kits ahead of time, instead of trying to figure it out during a roadside emergency.

That goes for changing tires, as well. A recent AAA survey found that 20 percent of drivers don’t know how to do it at all.

And since a bad spare tire or repair kit is the same as not having either, car owners need to remember to check them periodically, to make sure they’re properly maintained and ready to go.","1 in 5 drivers can't change a flat tire, but many don't have a spare anyway",https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/19/1-in-5-drivers-cant-change-flat-tire-but-many-dont-have-spare-anyway.html

But some retailers are using the viral campaign to sell products, and not everyone agrees with this decision.

One product in particular has sparked a wave of backlash, with many accusing the designer of profiting off others’ pain. Jewelry company Adornia announced its latest product, a lariat necklace spelling out “Me Too,” which retails for $44.

Initially, the brand promised to donate 10 percent of all proceeds to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network. However, it later amended that amount to 100 percent, though it’s unclear whether this was spurred on by harsh criticism of the product or was simply a typo.

Allure reports that Adornia’s PR company followed up their initial email, correcting the error. “Apologies for the typo — 100% of the proceeds from this necklace is being donated to RAINN. Designer Moran Amir was inspired by her own experience as a survivor of adolescent sexual abuse to help women speak out loud.” However, according to Refinery29, Adornia designer Moran Amir made the change in an effort to assuage people’s criticism of her motives. “To eschew any controversy that I was profiting off of other people's pain, I raised the donation to RAINN to 100%,” she said.

But despite the altruistic element, reactions to the necklace were fierce, with people on Twitter calling the product “opportunistic” and “gross.”

“Today in the complete and utter reprehensible cooptation of feminist causes, a brand is selling a ""ME TOO"" necklace,” one Twitter user wrote.

“It seems really opportunistic and tone-deaf to be commodifying an organic movement for awareness of sexual assault with #MeToo jewelry,” another user wrote. ""I really like the idea of wearing our beliefs on our sleeve proverbial or not.""

FITNESS COMPANY SLAMMED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE' POSTER BLASTS CRITICS AS 'WHINY FEMINAZIS'

Others argue that there’s nothing wrong with the necklace, and is simply a symbol of female empowerment.

“I think it's cool. Feminists have always used fashion to get the message across, from Suffragette sashes to throwing away bras. Dope,” another user tweeted.

In spite of the harsh feedback to the product, Amir is standing by the necklace, and the company has responded to critics multiple times on Twitter.

“We mean no offense so decided to increase the donation to 100% for this necklace in order to state our mission more clearly,” Adornia wrote.

“I appreciate your feedback. Our intention was to unite women through this expression, not profit off their pain,” the company wrote.

Amir explained to Refinery29 why she created the necklace in the first place, noting how shocked she was by the controversy.

As in those countries, increasing numbers of citizens are tired of being told what to do by Brussels. They don’t want to adopt the euro, preferring their currency, the koruna. They don’t want to take in more immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, as Germany’s iron-willed chancellor Angela Merkel has mandated for the past two years. Merkel got her comeuppance in her country’s national elections, where her Christian Democrats came in first but garnered far fewer votes than it did in 2013.

The Czech Republic, which spent decades decaying behind the Soviet-era Iron Curtain, flourished in its early years of political independence. But the worldwide economic meltdown in 2008 convinced Czechs that their traditional parties were corrupt and too willing to take orders from the E.U.

For as far back as anyone can remember graduates wore gowns reflecting the school colors. The guys wore navy blue gowns and the gals wore blue gowns.

But that tradition just got deep-sixed for the sake of gender inclusivity – and now graduates will only be allowed to wear one color that represents all genders.

“This is a very big national initiative,” Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Penelope DeLeon told the student newspaper. “It is not about gender equality as much as it is about being respectful to everybody’s choice to select a gender or not to select a gender, and we have students who choose not to.”

Wait. What?

So, kids now have the option of being genderless? Is that the latest fad among the sex and gender revolutionaries?

The Stinger, in a well-written report, noted that not everyone is on board with the school district’s gender neutral color palate.

“I understand that gender neutrality is a growing topic,” student Drew Reyes told the newspaper. “I just think we could have [found] a solution that allowed us to keep both colors, since they’re both shades of blue.”

Well, that’s not going to happen because the school district is 50 shades of stupid.

“The whole school shouldn’t have to wear one color just to accommodate some people,” student Isaac DeLara told the newspaper.

School staffer Lori Pristera was happy to tackle that question.

“That’s like saying you have three percent of your graduating class who are deaf so we don’t want a sign language interpreter there because that’s not what 97 percent of the students need,” she told the newspaper.

Ironic – seeing how the school district is absolutely tone deaf on this issue.

But there might be a simple fix for students who want to honor tradition and wear gender-specific graduation gowns.

The guys should show up on graduation day wearing navy blue and the girls should wear blue.

If the principal objects, just them tell you are “color neutral.” And as a color neutral student, your navy blue gown actually identifies as a blue gown – or vice versa.

Shannon Kepler, 57, a former Tulsa police officer, was found guilty of killing Jeremy Lake, 19, in Aug. 2014. Lake was dating Kepler’s then 18-year-old daughter, Lisa, at the time.

The jury, which deliberated for about six hours, recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison.

Lake’s death occurred four days before a white police officer fatally shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The killing sparked months of protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which decried police violence against minorities and called for greater transparency from law enforcement officials.

The issue of race had become an undercurrent in Kepler’s trial after a single black juror was seated for each of the four trials, and civil rights activists accused Kepler’s lawyers of purposely trying to exclude potential black candidates. They denied the accusation.

PROSECUTOR GRATEFUL FOR VERDICT IN EX-COP’S 4TH MURDER TRIAL

Kepler’s attorneys said the former officer was trying to protect his daughter because she ran away from home and was living in a crime-ridden area. Defense attorney Richard O’Carroll said Lisa had been in and out of a homeless shelter after her father forbade her to bring men into the home.

Lisa Kepler met Lake when he was a volunteer at the homeless shelter where she was residing, the Daily Mail reported. She said her parents booted her out of the house and left her at the shelter after she was caught sneaking out of their home.

Kepler told investigators Lake was armed and that he was acting in self-defense, but police did not find a weapon on Lake or at the scene.

Kepler, a 24-year-police veteran, retired from the force after he was charged with the shooting.

Prosecutors said Kepler watched his daughter and Lake from his car before approaching them on the street. Lake’s aunt disputed Kepler’s self-defense account and has said her nephew was reaching out to shake Kepler’s hand to introduce himself when Kepler fired.

Kepler told the court he called his wife, Gina Kepler, who was also an officer in Tulsa, after he fled the scene.

Kepler turned himself in to police the next day with his wife. Gina Kepler was arrested for being “an accessory to the crime” but was never formally charged.

Kepler will be formally sentenced on Nov. 20.

The New York Times reported that as recent as last week, these ads were found on sites like PolitiFact and Snopes.

The report said the ads took the reader to sites that looked like major media websites, like Vogue and People. The headlines read, for example, “Melania Trump is leaving the White House!”

The articles looks similar to a standard news site, but they transitioned to an ad. In one case, an anti-aging skin cream, the report said.

Nearly a year after Facebook and Google launched offensives against fake news, they’re still inadvertently promoting it — often at the worst possible times.

Online services designed to engross users aren’t so easily retooled to promote greater accuracy, it turns out. Especially with online trolls, pranksters and more malicious types scheming to evade new controls as they’re rolled out.

In the immediate aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Facebook’s “Crisis Response” page for the attack featured a false article misidentifying the gunman and claiming he was a “far left loon.” Google promoted a similarly erroneous item from the anonymous prankster site 4chan in its “Top Stories” results.

A day after the attack, a YouTube search on “Las Vegas shooting” yielded a conspiracy-theory video that claimed multiple shooters were involved in the attack as the fifth result. YouTube is owned by Google.

None of these stories were true. Police identified the sole shooter as Stephen Paddock, a Nevada man whose motive remains a mystery . The Oct. 1 attack on a music festival left 58 dead and hundreds wounded.

The companies quickly purged offending links and tweaked their algorithms to favor more authoritative sources. But their work is clearly incomplete — a different Las Vegas conspiracy video was the eighth result displayed by YouTube in a search Monday.

“As always, when we find deceptive ad practices on our platforms we move swiftly to take action, including suspending the advertiser account if appropriate,” Chi Hea Cho, a Google spokeswoman, told The Times in a statement. “In addition, we give publishers controls so they can block specific types of ads and advertisers.”

PARENTS OF MISSING TEXAS GIRL, 3, WHO WAS SENT OUTSIDE FOR NOT DRINKING MILK NOT COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATION

Attorney Bree West is a former Dallas County assistant district attorney who is not involved in the case. She says most of the items collected at the Richardson home were pretty standard. But some items that stood out to her were: a blue string, dark hair-like fibers, vacuum contents, two yellow gloves, dish scrubber inside two grocery bags and the washer and dryer.

“If we think it's true that he washed clothes, then what can we find in this washer? Is there going to be DNA evidence? Is there potentially going to be blood evidence?” West said. “If you're talking about dryers, is it possible there's going to be fibers or hairs? All of those things that may help police connect some of the dots.”

While they have not said where, police say there are still active searches happening on Wednesday. They’ve focused on areas south of the family’s Richardson home.

Just before noon on Wednesday, a family member or friend showed up at the home and stayed for about an hour before backing out of the garage and driving off. It was the first time we've seen anyone coming or going from this home in days.

The vehicle he was driving was one of three belonging to the Mathews family that police seized and searched Court records show the Lexus SUV had DNA swabs, dried grass and debris taken from it.

But it's another family vehicle that police have given the most attention — the Acura MDX that police say was driven away from the home for one hour on the morning of Sherin’s disappearance.

Court records show a navigation unit likely from the Acura was sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia.

“Even if you didn't plug in an address and say make a right or a left, it’s still recording where you were going,” West said. “And it's also going to pinpoint where you stopped.”

Sherin has been missing for 11 days. Her father, Wesley Mathews, is charged with child endangerment.

He told police he put her outside alone very early on Oct. 7 as punishment for refusing to drink her milk. He said she was gone when he returned 15 minutes later.

People lost their health care plans and couldn’t keep their doctors.
Sadly, such deception was knowingly used to sell this disastrous health care law.
But then again, the law wasn’t designed to improve the nation's health care system - it was designed to sabotage and undermine health care as we knew it.
President Trump was right to restore law and order to our health care system.","If you’ve turned on the news and heard any of the outrage from Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and others on the left accusing President Trump of “vast, pointless sabotage,” you might assume that the president had repealed the Affordable Care Act last week through executive fiat.

Hysteria makes for a nice messaging tactic, but facts are stubborn things. Let’s put the House and Senate minority leaders’ talking points aside and look at what’s really happened with this executive order.

For starters, President Obama’s “cost sharing reimbursements” (CSR’s) to insurance companies were illegal. The executive branch cannot allocate money that Congress hasn’t appropriated. Avik Roy wrote a piece in Forbes this weekend that appropriately characterized President Trump’s decision to end CSR payments as “not a health policy decision, but rather a constitutional one” because “it is simply illegal for the federal government to spend money that Congress hasn’t authorized it to spend.” David French also outlined this idea in National Review when he said, “They [the CSRs] were never lawful because Congress never appropriated the money.”

It’s ironic Pelosi and Schumer are accusing the president of sabotaging ObamaCare given the fact that they were the ones who sabotaged our nation’s health care by passing ObamaCare in the first place, before even knowing what was in it.

Ultimately, this alone should be enough to justify the president’s decision. It was not a “sabotage” of ObamaCare, as Schumer and Pelosi called it. It simply restored the rule of law by undoing the unconstitutional actions of the Obama administration.

But looking at Pelosi and Schumer’s accusations in context, it’s ironic they are accusing the president of sabotaging ObamaCare given the fact that they were the ones who sabotaged our nation’s health care by passing ObamaCare in the first place, before even knowing what was in it.

Remember: ObamaCare was sold on false promises that could never be kept. Recall what they told us in order to sell this bill: If you like your health care plan, you can keep it; if you like your doctors, you can keep them; premiums will go down – and for families they’ll go down by an average of $2,500; deductibles will go down; emergency room visits will go down.

All of these assertions were false. Seventy-five percent of the ObamaCare-created state health care co-ops have gone out of business. Premiums have gone up drastically. Deductibles have risen. People lost their health care plans and couldn’t keep their doctors. This law made health insurance costlier and it made the business of offering it riskier.

Sadly, such deception was knowingly used to sell this disastrous health care law. Jonathan Gruber, who the New York Times called the “architect of ObamaCare,” told us as much when he said, “Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical to get for the thing to pass.”

It’s difficult to explain your motives any more clearly than that.

But then again, the law wasn’t designed to improve the nation's health care system - it was designed to sabotage and undermine health care as we knew it. Former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told us as much when he was asked in 2013 whether the country would have to have a health care system that “abandoned insurance as the means of accessing it.” His answer? “Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.”

So let’s be honest about what has happened here: Democrats, led by Pelosi and Schumer, rammed through a government takeover of health care that was nothing more than a leap toward single-payer health care deceptively sold as a market-based solution. And as the system collapsed, it has become evident that ObamaCare, through skyrocketing premium increases and taxpayer-funded CSRs, was designed to fail. Now that it’s failing, they’re blaming Republicans and calling for single-payer.

The Pelosi and Schumer outrage is baseless, but the American people’s outrage is not. They elected President Trump because they are tired of politicians who say one thing and do another. They’re tired of their elected officials making promises and then abandoning those commitments once they get in office. That must end. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it well: If you’re not strong enough to do what you said and vote to repeal ObamaCare, you don’t deserve to stay in office.

President Trump was right to restore law and order to our health care system. And he was right to remind Congress that Americans are tired of inaction, and want us to repeal ObamaCare. Now it’s the Republican Party’s turn, and we must deliver on our promise. Failure would be truly outrageous.

You have no right, nor should any employer tolerate attempts, to damage that business by alienating its customer base.
These kneeling player-employees have put their NFL team owners in a difficult spot.
The ramifications of that damage will impact the employees and team owners for some time to come.","Like many Americans, I find it distressing to see multi-millionaire athletes kneeling during the playing of our national anthem before professional football games. In my lifetime, football has been a big part of our image as Americans.

In my working-class Cleveland, Ohio family, Sunday football was always a big event. One of my cousins was married to Lenny Dawson who would become a Hall of Fame quarterback. It was a rare Sunday during football season when we weren’t gathered around our TV or radio for the Cleveland Browns or the Kansas City Chiefs game (both if possible).

As we watched those games, I had no idea the political affiliation of any of the players and I certainly don’t recall any political discussions during the games (a rarity). We ate, the adults drank, some smoked, and we all felt a part of something both exciting and uniquely American.

I came to love the game. Seeing Jim Brown run down the field is as much a part of my youth as JFK’s inaugural address. I’m not equating their historical relevance. But, both inspired and encouraged my generation regardless of your race, religion or political affiliation. They were simply uplifting.

Employees have no constitutional right to alienate a business’ customer base, damaging the business that employs both them and their co-workers, not to mention the owners who have taken the financial risks to create that business.

In more recent times, I would take my youngest son to Super Bowl games. He was a fan and it was something we could share apart from his siblings. He went on to play on his high school team that had a very successful record in his senior year. I happily worked the chain gang for those games, measuring to see if we had a first down. Football taught my son important lessons about hard work, individual achievement and being part of a team. It was a unique experience. It too was simply uplifting.

I’m not watching professional football anymore. It’s not that I’ve stopped being a fan. I just find it hard to cheer on individuals who have so clearly benefitted from the opportunities our nation offers but refuse to acknowledge the sacrifice of so many Americans who risked or even lost their lives to protect the freedoms we (and they) all enjoy.

Given the uncharacteristically low ratings and empty stadium seats in recent weeks, it appears that I’m not alone. You may or may not like Donald Trump and you may or may not believe he should have gotten involved in this issue. But, as he often does, the president articulated what a lot of Americans were feeling. We simply do not support what these players are doing and, just as they have the right to kneel, we have the right to turn off the games or, like Vice President Pence, we have the right to leave.

The NFL could have prevented this. Honestly, any competent employer would have. Employees do not have the right to alienate a business’ customer base, damaging the business that employs them. As an owner, you can respect your employees’ First Amendment rights without destroying your business. In fact, it could be argued that you are obligated to do so in defense of your other employees - who count on the jobs and incomes you provide - not to mention the investments your shareholders, franchisees or, in this case, team owners all make to build, operate and acquire these businesses.

I ran the company that owns the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s restaurant chains for almost 17 years. Along with our franchisees, we employed about 75,000 Americans and we flew the American flag in front of many of our restaurants. Had any company employees decided to disrespect that flag in front of our customers, in our brand’s uniform and during their hours of employment, I would have encouraged our general managers to first warn them to stop and, if they refused, to fire them.

I am very supportive of First Amendment rights and would encourage employees to express their opinions openly and freely, on their own time. But employees have no constitutional right to alienate a business’ customer base, damaging the business that employs both them and their co-workers, not to mention the owners who have taken the financial risks to create that business. When you accept employment, you accept the responsibility to advance the interests of the business that employs you. You have no right, nor should any employer tolerate attempts, to damage that business by alienating its customer base.

These kneeling player-employees have put their NFL team owners in a difficult spot. On the one hand, they certainly do not want players alienating their customers. On the other hand, team unity is important to a winning season and they naturally want to be sensitive to their players’ concerns. But, they never should have been put in this position.

The NFL has rules as to the decorum players are to demonstrate during the playing of our national anthem. They don’t have to sing along or hold their hands to their hearts (although some notably do). But they do have to show the respect to which our flag and those who have sacrificed for it deserve.

The NFL’s failure to enforce this rule and late to the game efforts to resolve this problem, have hurt the sport. The ramifications of that damage will impact the employees and team owners for some time to come. It’s too bad. A lot of us really enjoyed the game - and our dollars helped pay those multi-millionaires’ salaries.","Former Carl’s Jr. CEO: NFL could have prevented protest mess, as any competent employer would",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/18/former-carl-s-jr-ceo-nfl-could-have-prevented-protest-mess-as-any-competent-employer-would.html

Recently, one sweet young dad went above and beyond to ensure that his partner didn’t feel self-conscious over a breastfeeding stain.

Taking to Facebook on Oct. 12 to share the story, Chris Lopez of Chino, Calif, wrote that she and her partner, Cee Grant, were running errands one morning when Grant surprised her with a funny stain on his button-down dress shirt. Grant’s spot wasn’t accidental, but rather intentional, to show support for the mother of his two children, who is currently nursing their youngest.

The gesture gave Lopez much more than a laugh. According to Lopez, Grant was recovering from a substance abuse problem back when she was breastfeeding their first child Dominic, who is now three, and his love and support as she breastfeeds little Camilla, almost 11 months old, makes all the difference.

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch.

According to Racer.com, the series is also using the tests to see if any tweaks are needed for the track’s layout, which turns the 1.5-mile quad-oval into a 2.4-mile-long, 18-turn circuit.

For as far back as anyone can remember graduates wore gowns reflecting the school colors. The guys wore navy blue gowns and the gals wore blue gowns.

But that tradition just got deep-sixed for the sake of gender inclusivity – and now graduates will only be allowed to wear one color that represents all genders.

“This is a very big national initiative,” Oxnard Union High School District Supt. Penelope DeLeon told the student newspaper. “It is not about gender equality as much as it is about being respectful to everybody’s choice to select a gender or not to select a gender, and we have students who choose not to.”

Wait. What?

So, kids now have the option of being genderless? Is that the latest fad among the sex and gender revolutionaries?

The Stinger, in a well-written report, noted that not everyone is on board with the school district’s gender neutral color palate.

“I understand that gender neutrality is a growing topic,” student Drew Reyes told the newspaper. “I just think we could have [found] a solution that allowed us to keep both colors, since they’re both shades of blue.”

Well, that’s not going to happen because the school district is 50 shades of stupid.

“The whole school shouldn’t have to wear one color just to accommodate some people,” student Isaac DeLara told the newspaper.

School staffer Lori Pristera was happy to tackle that question.

“That’s like saying you have three percent of your graduating class who are deaf so we don’t want a sign language interpreter there because that’s not what 97 percent of the students need,” she told the newspaper.

Ironic – seeing how the school district is absolutely tone deaf on this issue.

But there might be a simple fix for students who want to honor tradition and wear gender-specific graduation gowns.

The guys should show up on graduation day wearing navy blue and the girls should wear blue.

If the principal objects, just them tell you are “color neutral.” And as a color neutral student, your navy blue gown actually identifies as a blue gown – or vice versa.

The 77-year-old Midwesterner plowed that phrase into his bean crops - a massive message spanning the length of two football fields - in response to the controversial protest undertaken by some NFL players who've begun kneeling during the playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

“I go with [President] Trump on this one,” Hanson told Fox News on Tuesday. “If you want to protest, that’s not the place to do it.”

He added: “A lot of people died over our flag. We’re able to voice our opinion because of it. If you’re going to show respect for anything, do it for the national anthem.”

Hanson has a track record of designing and digging massive messages – many political – using his old Massey tractor on his 850-acre farm.

And Hanson doesn’t use GPS or any technology for the work, which he says “works out pretty good in a harvested bean field.”

Then he flies his two-seater plane, and if his design passes the test, he snaps a pic with a Cannon camera and posts it on Facebook. He said he's only been unsuccessful twice.

Hanson told Fox News he got his “We Stand for the National Anthem” message right on the second try. During the first attempt, he was interrupted by a passerby with only two letters to go. He soon relocated to another section of the field.

Hanson said he initially wanted to add an addendum -- “We kneel at the cross” -- but the plan was foiled by the first frost of the season.

Hanson said, weather permitting, he plans to add that phrase soon.

Hanson and his wife, Darlene, are Lutherans and attend church regularly. He also describes himself as a Republican and Trump supporter, and he had the chance to get a picture of the president when Trump came to North Dakota for a tax reform speech in September.

“I was 20 feet away from him,” Hanson said. “It was a good meeting and the president stayed on script.”

Hanson said he believes Trump is trying to do well, but faces a “continuous battle” in Washington, D.C. And Hanson said he's doing all he can to send his support from his Edgeley farm.

Some of his previous messages include “Drain the Swamp,” “Blue Lives Matter,” “Feel the Bern,” “GOP, get your act together,” and “Vote Trump.”

He said his Prince symbol, plowed after the singer passed away, was one of his most popular for fans all over the world, but he caught a lot of flak for his “Never Hillary” message.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

The controversial film debuted last month at the Toronto Film Festival to positive reviews.

The film stars the comedian as a wealthy writer whose teenage daughter, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, comes to live with him in his apartment. At an event, Moretz and C.K. meet a well-known writer-director, played by John Malkovich, who was infamous for dating younger women.

Moretz and Malkovich begin dating which horrifies C.K. due to her age.

DONNA KARAN ON HARVEY WEINSTEIN REMARKS: ‘I REGRET IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART’

“She’s a minor!” C.K. is seen yelling to Malkovich in the trailer.

The black-and-white film appeared to pay homage to Woody Allen’s 1979 film, “Manhattan,” which also focused on a relationship between a teenager and an older man.

Media outlets, such as Esquire, Slate and Paste, noted the timing of the trailer makes it controversial. A number of A-list actresses have claimed Weinstein raped, assaulted or harassed them.

Slate called the trailer “icky” while Esquire wrote, “Now is not the time for this Louis C.K. movie.”

Social media users took to Twitter to blast the film’s trailer.

“It’s honestly a bit shocking to see how tone deaf Louis C.K. is in 2017 because he was once a comedian ahead of the curve in so many ways,” one social media user tweeted.

“That uncomfortable moment when you start to discover that Louis C.K. is slowly becoming Woody Allen,” another Twitter user wrote.

C.K. told The Hollywood Reporter last month, “It’s just a f--king movie. We’re depicting oxygen-rich people who live in these beautiful apartments and offices saying whatever they want. Folks say s--t to each other. You can’t think about the audience when you’re making the thing. If you do, you’re not giving them something that came out of your gut. You’ll be making something that you’re like, ‘Is this OK for you?’ And they say, ‘Yes, thank you.’ Mark Twain said something like, ‘You can’t say no one can eat steak just because the baby doesn’t have teeth yet.'”

REESE WITHERSPOON REVEALS DIRECTOR SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER AT AGE 16

Like Weinstein, the comedian has also been accused of sexual misconduct by female comedians. Gawker published an article two years ago detailing the allegations against Louis C.K. while writer and comedian Tig Notaro told the Daily Beast in August that the comedian needed to “handle the allegations.”

On Wednesday, Megan Koester wrote an article for Vice alleging she was shut down from a story she was writing regarding the sexual misconduct rumors surrounding the comedian.

“I made my move on the red carpet of the awards show,” Koester wrote. “One by one, I would ask a conveyor belt of comedians, all men, 'How do you feel about the Cosby allegations?' They would all, invariably, claim to be disgusted by the man's misdeeds. I would then follow up with 'How do you feel about the Louis C.K. allegations?' They would all, invariably, claim ignorance.”

Attendees of the show were blasting the venue on Facebook and Twitter Friday morning, posting videos of Brooks playing with a significant echo that frustrated fans. Some fans who were sitting close to the stage reportedly left early.

The Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive end already gave up his first six game checks to provide two scholarships for students in Charlottesville, Virginia. Now, he’s using the next 10 to launch the Pledge 10 for Tomorrow campaign.

“My wife and I have been passionate about education being a gateway for upward mobility and equality,” Long told The Associated Press. “I think we can all agree that equity in education can help affect change that we all want to see in this country.”

Long signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Eagles, including a $500,000 signing bonus and $1.5 million guaranteed. His base salary in 2017 is $1 million.

The charitable initiative encourages people to make donations to improve equal education opportunities. Long began his career in St. Louis in 2008 and played for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season. Long’s foundation has selected four organizations whose missions focus on making education easily accessible to underserved youth while also providing students the support they need to develop strong social and emotional character.

The four organizations are based in the three communities in which Long has played during his NFL career. The city that raises the most money during the season will receive an additional $50,000 donation.

Both numbers were expected to rise as crews continue assessing areas scorched by the blazes that killed 42 people.

State Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said the preliminary dollar valuation of losses came from claims filed with the eight largest insurance companies in the affected areas and did not include uninsured property.

The estimate of homes and structures burned was boosted to 6,900 from 5,700 as fire crews returned to hard-hit neighborhoods and assessed remote and rural areas they could not get to earlier, said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

He said most of the newly counted destroyed buildings burned on Oct. 8 and Oct. 9 — when the wildfires broke out in Northern California's wine country and other nearby areas.

""The estimates are in structures and are mostly homes, but also includes commercial structures and outbuildings like barns and sheds,"" Berlant said.

Twenty two of the 42 deaths in California's October fires happened in a Sonoma County wildfire, making it the third deadliest in California history. A 1933 Los Angeles fire that killed 29 people was the deadliest, followed by a 1991 fire in Oakland that killed 25.

California Gov. Jerry Brown late Wednesday issued an executive order to speed up recovery efforts as fire authorities say they've stopped the progress of wildfires.

Tens of thousands of people have been allowed back home but more than 15,000 people remain evacuated Thursday, down from a high of 100,000 last Saturday.

Brown's order also allowed disrupted wineries to relocate tasting rooms and suspended state fees for mobile home parks and manufactured homes.

The order extends the state's prohibition on price gouging during emergencies until April 2018 and expedites hiring of personnel for emergency and recovery operations.

In Los Angeles County, authorities said a charred body was found on Mount Wilson, where crews were trying to surround a smoldering wildfire in steep terrain.

The male body discovered late Wednesday was recovered by the coroner's office, which will try to identify it, said Sheriff's Sgt. Vincent Plair.

California firefighters were also battling a blaze that sent smoke billowing into the college beach town of Santa Cruz.

The wildfire in steep and rugged terrain had grown to nearly half a square mile and the number of houses threatened by the fire had doubled to 300.

It uses two fuel cell stacks with generate enough electricity to power a pair of electric motors each delivering 150 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque.","Toyota’s first volume fuel cell vehicle, the Mirai, is an econo sedan priced like a luxury one. Understandably, the car hasn’t proven a hit, with Toyota moving just 708 examples in the first half of 2017 in the United States. (Of course, it also doesn’t help that hydrogen fueling stations are non-existent in most parts.)

Perhaps, though, Toyota could have had more success if it followed Tesla’s strategy of introducing new technology in high-end products brimming with coolness. Well, that could still happen if Toyota’s latest concept is any indication of the automaker’s future path for fuel cells.

The Fine-Comfort Ride concept, unveiled on Wednesday ahead of a debut next week at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show, is a high-performance luxury car powered by a fuel cell.

A fuel cell stack at the front of the vehicle turns hydrogen from storage tanks under the floor into electricity which then powers an electric drive system delivering up to 415 horsepower. With this much juice on tap, Toyota says the Fine-Comfort Ride will accelerate to 62 mph from rest in 5.4 seconds and top out at 136 mph. Meanwhile, the range on a fill of hydrogen is claimed to be 620 miles.

The exterior is more minivan than luxury sedan but the interior keeps things cool with its funky, futuristic design. There is seating for six, despite the Fine-Comfort Ride stretching just 190 inches in length, or a smidge less than the Mirai.

The ample space is made possible by adopting in-wheel motors for the propulsion, positioning the wheels at the very corners of the vehicle, and utilizing a reinforced underbody for the ride stability and quietness expected in a premium car.

There’s fully self-driving technology available, too. So when the driver tires of doing the actual driving, he or she can flip the car into autonomous mode and then turn the seat around to join in on the conversation with other passengers. An artificial intelligence system, which Toyota calls the AI Agent and will be present in three separate concepts, watches over the driver as needed and assists as needed.

While the Fine-Comfort Ride may or may not be headed for production in the near future, another fuel cell concept from Toyota will be spawning a production model very soon. The concept is the Sora bus which will be put into production next year. It uses two fuel cell stacks with generate enough electricity to power a pair of electric motors each delivering 150 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. Toyota doesn’t state a range but says the bus can hold 158 gallons of hydrogen.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection awarded eight contracts to six companies to build the prototypes. Four are made of reinforced concrete, the others involve alternate materials, mostly steel.

Each model is 18 to 30 feet high and 30 feet long. Contractors have until Oct. 26 to complete their design before testing begins. All of the construction is taking place a few miles east of San Diego.

Testing will include how long it takes to scale the barrier, or breach it using a concrete saw or jackhammer. Do the designs contain sensors? If so, can the prototype alert agents when someone is trying to breach, scale or dig beneath the wall?

Why is that important? Border patrol agents say a fence, wall or barrier – call it what you want – only buys time. Every wall can be breached. Agents need appropriate roads to reach any area along the border in a matter of minutes to interdict or apprehend an individual.

The question for evaluators will be: one, what design works best for the money and, secondly, where is it to be located? What works in the desert, say solid precast concrete, will not work in canyons where there is flash flooding. In that terrain, a design utilizing steel bollards may work best.

Compared to existing fencing along the border, which ranges from 10 feet tall steel mat installed in the 1990s, to 16-foot-tall steel mesh erected in 2006, the new designs at 30 feet tall are imposing.

As for actually getting built, the politics is messy and some lawmakers purposely misinform the public as to what is being proposed.

One, the CBP is not proposing a 2,200-mile-all from San Diego, Calif, to Brownsville, Texas. That is not realistic, necessary or affordable.

Two, existing law calls for 700 miles of “double fencing.” The U.S. doesn't have that. Under the 2006 Secure Fence Act, the federal government only completed 350 miles of fence, and only in select areas are there two fences.

Many argue, Congress has already authorized another 300 miles of barrier. Whether it’s called a fence or a wall, is politics.","First look at 8 prototypes of Trump's 'big, beautiful' border wall",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/19/first-look-at-8-prototypes-trumps-big-beautiful-border-wall.html

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them.","Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them.

And Americans have President Trump to thank. From the travel ban to its rejection of the disastrous Iran deal, the Trump administration has prioritized our national security above all else—whether Blow wants to believe it or not.

But to evoke Adolf Hitler—the most reviled dictator in the history of the world—is a bridge too far, even for the New York Times. Mentioning his name in the same sentence as our president is not only intellectually dishonest—which even Blow acknowledges—but also insulting to the innocent civilians who suffered under the Nazi regime and their family members, who continue to cope with the sheer evil of Nazi atrocities.

Not that we need a reminder, but the Holocaust killed as many as 20 million victims overall. Millions more died fighting German forces to liberate Europe from Nazi authoritarianism.

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them. Blow argues our president is next in the line of “powerful leaders [who] use lying as a form of mass manipulation.” Yet the Times columnist provides no examples because he can’t. Even if he could, there is no comparison between a lie and the mass execution of millions of innocent civilians.

Shame on the New York Times for publishing such vitriolic content. It’s no wonder trust in the left-leaning mainstream media is at an all-time low. Less than one-third of Americans express even “a fair amount” of confidence in the media. After months of rabid anti-Trump headlines, only 14 percent of Republicans trust news outlets to do their job. With columnists like Blow in the fold, why would they?

What Americans do trust is the Trump agenda, which will make our country safer and revitalize our economy like never before. President Trump’s approval ratings are highest when it comes to handling terrorism—actual terror, not Blow’s definition—and managing the economy. It’s no coincidence consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2004.

The American people can take pride in a president who champions them, even as liberal snowflakes fan the flames of “resistance.”

Damning new evidence appears to show that Hillary Clinton used her office as Secretary of State to confer benefits to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars in donations to her foundation and cash to her husband.

But there’s more. It seems it was all covered up for years by the same three people who are now involved in the investigation of President Donald Trump over so-called Russian “collusion.”

The incriminating evidence was uncovered by The Hill (John Solomon and Alison Spann) and Circa News (Sara Carter). Their dogged reporting reveals that the FBI gathered a multitude of documents, secret recordings, intercepted emails, financial records, and eyewitnesses accounts showing that Russian nuclear officials directed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bill Clinton during the very time that Hillary Clinton presided over a governing body which unanimously approved the sale of one-fifth of America’s uranium supply to Russia.

The corrupt scheme is said to have been financed by the Russians through bribes, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering. The FBI and the Department of Justice reportedly had the evidence in their possession before the uranium sale, but kept the matter secret and never notified Congress which would surely have stopped the transfer of uranium to Russia.

Indeed, the entire sordid affair remained hidden for seven long years. Until now.

What do we know about the attack?

About 50 Islamic extremists attacked a group of American and Niger troops on Oct. 4, killing four American soldiers and wounding two others. Nearly 10 Niger troops were also killed.

The 12-member team was reportedly in unarmored trucks when the ambush occurred. They had just met with local leaders.

No extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but it appears to be the work of the Islamic State of the Sahel, a splinter group of extremists loyal to the Islamic State group based in Mali, just across the border.

SANDERS RIPS DEM FOR CALLING NIGER ATTACK ‘TRUMP’S BENGHAZI’

Details about the attack are still few, but the group was reportedly new to the area.

Who were the Americans killed?

Sgt. La David Johnson, 25; Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson 39; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, were killed in the attack.

The bodies of some of the Americans killed were recovered by a U.S.-contracted helicopter, a U.S. official told Fox News.

What else should you know?

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday that his department is investigating the attack.

“We will look at this and say was there something we have to adapt to now, should we have been in a better stance,” Mattis said. “We need to always look at this. We’re not complacent, we’re going to be better.”

Mattis also dismissed allegations that rescue operations were slow to respond to the attack.

GOLD STAR FAMILIES CAUGHT IN MEDIA FIRESTORM

U.S. Africa Command has launched an investigation into the ambush and will review whether additional security or armed support is needed for these types of missions.

“The patrol that was attacked last week had actually done 29 patrols without contact over the previous six months or so; no indication that this was going to occur. I would say that what was actually very positive about it was the fact that they were able to have close-air support overhead, about 30 minutes after first contact, which is pretty impressive,” the director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., told reporters last week.

Why are troops in Niger?

For several years, American and French troops have provided trainings and support to the militaries of Niger and other vulnerable African countries where Islamic extremism has grown.

What else?

The White House has been widely criticized for its response to the attack – especially in the delay in acknowledging the ambush. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier this week that the delay in the public acknowledgment of the attack was due to a “process that is standard protocol.”

Trump was also criticized for his public feud with a Democratic congresswoman and Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., accused Trump of making “insensitive” remarks to Myeshia Johnson.

Trump has denied Wilson’s allegations, but the mother of the deceased soldier has backed up Wilson’s claims.

White House chief of staff John Kelly said he was ""heartbroken"" that Wilson used the conversation she overheard to attack Trump. He added that the president did the best he could in the situation.

@KEVINNR

The technology that has amplified the private citizen also amplifies the corporate executive, the tech-savvy oppressor, and the billionaire dilettante with political aspirations. Everybody hates Amazon. It’s kind of weird. Donald Trump, as a candidate, threatened to bring antitrust actions against Amazon and accused the Internet retailer of dodging taxes, and as president Trump has taken a special interest in the company’s CEO, Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, which offends Trump by reporting on his antics from time to time. “Believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems,” he said. “They are going to have such problems.”

Farhad Manjoo, writing in the New York Times, said Amazon’s behavior during its dispute with book publisher Hachette “is confirming its critics’ worst fears and it is an ugly spectacle to behold.” Tony Schwartz blasted Bezos for having an overly aggressive management style marked by periodic angry outbursts. (Tony Schwartz is the man who actually wrote Donald Trump’s Art of the Deal.) Paul Krugman insists Amazon “has too much power, and it uses that power in ways that hurt America.” Krugman also suggested that Amazon was scheming to help Republicans’ electoral chances. The company has been the target of boycotts since the 1990s, and it has been criticized for its handling of taxes, for selling and not selling certain items, and for — incredibly enough — not making enough of a profit.

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

But in the original interview with NBC 5 on Wednesday, Johnson 'went there' when asked to respond to the scandal over disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. She said that she was “disappointed” in the man who supported many of her Democratic colleagues, but that women should be mindful how they appear.

“I grew up in a time when it was as much the woman’s responsibility as it was a man’s – how you were dressed, what your behavior was,” Johnson said. “I’m from the old school that you can have behaviors that appear inviting. It can be interpreted as such. That’s the responsibility, I think, of the female.”

Johnson, a 13-term congresswoman and former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, added that men have a “responsibility to be professional themselves.”

“I think we also need to start talking about the power that women have to control the situation. There’s law enforcement, you can refuse to cooperate with that kind of behavior,” Johnson said. “I think that many times, men get away with this because they are allowed to get away with it by the women.”

Johnson’s comments sparked a backlash Thursday on Twitter.

But when reached by Fox News for comment, Johnson later issued a detailed clarification, saying she does not “blame victims of sexual assault for the actions of their assailants.”

“Sexual assault and harassment has no place in our society. This is something I believe deeply. And at each turn of my professional life, I have made it my mission to fight for women’s rights. I do not blame victims of sexual assault for the actions of their assailants,” Johnson said. “I do acknowledge that my comments regarding behavior and attire come from an old school perspective that has shaped how some of us understand the issue, but that does not detract from the fact that criminals need to be held accountable for their actions.”



She continued, “I will never condone those who feel they can abuse the power of their positions to sexually assault and harass women, and I will always encourage victims to come forward so that we can hold these criminals accountable.”",Dem rep on Weinstein scandal: Women have ‘responsibility’ to watch their attire and behavior,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/19/dem-rep-on-weinstein-scandal-women-have-responsibility-to-watch-their-attire-and-behavior.html

Sen. Cotton on why he chooses not to spar with President Trump like many other Republicans:

The American people elected Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief and if we want to keep our country safe and secure, then it's important that the commander-in-chief succeed, and I think Donald Trump by and large is getting things right. He's certainly much more consistent with decades of bipartisan foreign policy leadership than Barack Obama was for the last eight years. So when the president does things like tells Congress and tells our allies that the Iran deal is not in the United States national security interests, or launches airstrikes against the Assad regime when they cross the U.S. red line, I'm going to support him.

Sen. Cotton on why he was glad the President did not certify the Iran deal:

Iran now is by all accounts about a year away from getting a nuclear weapon. This deal though starts to expire in a mere eight years, sometimes thirteen years with some of the provisions. I don't think we can wait eight to thirteen years. Iran is going to get stronger, it's economy is going to grow, it's going to get more conventional weapons like tanks and artillery and helicopters, and ultimately it will have a nuclear weapon. That's what we saw with the North Korea nuclear deal in 1994. They detonated their first bomb in 2006. So I don't think that we have the luxury of waiting eight to thirteen years to confront a nuclear Iran. I think we need to confront them now.

The 77-year-old man's right artificial hip joint was infected with the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which is responsible for a disease called tularemia, according to the case report, published Oct. 11 in the journal BMJ Case Reports.

Tularemia is also known as ""rabbit fever"" or ""deer fly fever,"" because the bacterium can be spread by handling an infected rabbit or being bitten by a deer fly. It can also be spread by tick bites. But in the man's case, it's not entirely clear how he picked up the infection.

""We did not find any ticks attached to his skin, although it's possible he may have had a tick bite or exposure in another form,"" said lead author Dr. Harsh Rawal, an internal medicine resident at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana-Champaign. Rawal was one of the doctors who treated the man.

The man didn't remember being bitten by a tick, and he had no pets that may have carried one into his home, according to the report. He also had no contact with any animals that could have transmitted the infection to him.

The man did tell the doctors that he had been a hunter about 50 years ago — some people may get the disease by handling or skinning infected rabbits, muskrats, prairie dogs and other rodents, according to the CDC — but, given his long absence from hunting, this wouldn't explain how he acquired the infection five decades later.

A pain in the hip

After having severe pain in his right hip for about a week, the man went to the emergency room, according to the report. At the time, he said he was concerned because 25 years earlier, he had a total hip replacement done on this hip and an artificial hip joint was inserted.

His doctors decided he needed surgery to repair his artificial hip joint and drain fluid from the area, but they found no evidence of any infection.

But one week after leaving the hospital, the man returned to the emergency room with right hip pain and a fever of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

It was then that the doctors noticed a bulbous skin lesion on one of his shins, according to the report, so they sent the man for blood tests and lab cultures once again.

This time, the tests revealed that the man was infected with F. tularensis.

Although he had lacked many of the usual symptoms of tularemia — such as swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, cough, trouble breathing or eye irritation — the skin lesion on his shin was a telltale sign of the most common form of the disease, called ulceroglandular tularemia. In this form, people develop a skin ulcer where the bacteria enter the body, and lymph nodes near the ulcer become swollen.

The skin lesion had been present on the man's leg for almost a year before his hip joint became infected, Rawal told Live Science.

Although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact location the organism may have entered the man's body, Rawal said he suspects it was probably the area where the skin lesion developed. No other joints besides the artificial hip joint became infected, he said.

A very uncommon infection

An infection with this type of bacteria in an artificial joint is very uncommon, Rawal said. In fact, this is only the second reported case in the medical literature of a prosthetic joint becoming infected with F. tularensis, the case report authors wrote.

And bacterial infections in artificial hip joints in general rarely, if ever, occur, Rawal said. When they do occur, the likely culprits are the organisms Staphylococcus aureus, which gives rise to MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infections, or streptococcus or pseudomonas species, he said.

The man did not want to have another surgery to remove his infected prosthetic joint, Rawal said. Instead, he took oral antibiotics for about a year to treat the infection.

Fortunately, the treatment worked: His skin lesion healed, his hip pain went away and he had no further symptoms of the bacterial infection.

A new discovery, however, may bring that dream to reality sooner than realized.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has discovered an enormous cave under the lunar surface, something it calls a ""very significant"" discovery, due to its value for both science and human expansion into space.

THE US WILL RETURN TO THE MOON, VP PENCE SAYS

The discovery was made by Japan’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer (Selene) probe and shows a 50 kilometer (31 miles) ""lava tube"" underground, alongside a lava flow river ""rille"" on the Marius Hills of the Moon. JAXA used radio waves to confirm the existence of the cave after examining the hole.

Benefits of the cave

In a press release detailing the findings, JAXA outlined the reasons why the so-called lava tubes, which it believes were formed by volcanic activity on the Moon, are ideal for lunar bases. ""Lava tubes may be the best place to build large-scale lunar bases because their interiors protect from dangerous space radiation, micrometeorite bombardment, and wide temperature oscillations,"" the space agency wrote.

The underground area is approximately 310 miles long and 100 meters (328 feet) wide and may contain rocks filled with either water or ice. The cave has been given the nickname of Kaguya, a moon princess in a Japanese fairytale.

“We’ve known about these locations that were thought to be lava tubes … but their existence has not been confirmed until now,” Junichi Haruyama, a researcher at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, told AFP on Thursday in comments obtained by The Guardian.

Haruyama, along with several others, is a co-author of the study.

A cave could shield humans from having to deal with the extreme temperatures on the Moon, due to its lack of atmosphere. During the day, temperatures can reach around 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) and at night can reach as low as minus 173 degrees Celsius (minus 279.4 degrees Fahrenheit), according to Space.com.

The volcanic activity, which is thought to have occurred between 3 and 4 billion years, gave the Moon a temporary atmosphere, however.

THE MOON'S INTERIOR COULD CONTAIN LOTS OF WATER, STUDY SHOWS

Space race is on

The study's co-authors said that their work is just beginning as the search for lunar caves continues. They will look at other regions of the Moon for additional underground lava tubes for ""future exploration of lava tubes or lunar base construction.""

Plans for human colonization of the Moon have heated up in recent months, with the likes of Musk and Bezos detailing plans for how their respective companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin will achieve the feat.

In May, Bezos said self-driving technologies, machine vision and other technologies could help rovers build a city on the Moon.

“There, you would want to pre-position a whole bunch of equipment and supplies before the humans show up, and some of those things might need to be assembled on the surface of the moon,” Bezos said in comments obtained by GeekWire. “And that’s the kind of thing that could also be done by advanced robotics with machine-learning systems on board.”

In September, SpaceX's Musk outlined plans for a base on the Moon, codenamed Moon Base Alpha, utilizing the company's BFR (Big F***ing Rocket) spacecraft.

Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss the importance of passing the budget today so we can move forward with tax reform. Listen to the full interview below:

Chairman Brady on the importance of the budget passing today's vote:

It means everything. This is, the budget gives us the runway to land tax reform on in a big, bold way. Secondly, and I think most importantly, it makes sure that no party including the democrats can obstruct tax reform from getting to the president's desk this year. So it's very simple. No budget, no tax reform. And from a timing standpoint, once that budget is reconciled between the house and senate it's signed, sealed and delivered within 24 hours. We're going to bring forward the Republican tax reform plan and for the first time in 31 years we're going to start action on it.

Chairman Brady responding to Joe Manchin saying he could get six to eight democrats:

I think we do have a lot of common ground with Democrats like Joe Manchin. They want a strong middle class tax cut. They want to stop seeing our jobs go overseas, in fact we want to see them come back here, we deliver exactly that. I wouldn't raise that business rate because it just gives an advantage to China and Europe and our competitors, but I want to continue to work with democrats on how we make our businesses more competitive, especially our main street businesses. You know those small businesses on average they make about $75,000 a year. They work their fingers to the bone. It is a tough slog and they're hiring a lot of our workers. We're continuing in the House in the Ways and Means Committee to continue to work to provide even more help for our smaller business.

Chairman Brady on what's at stake today with the budget vote:

Everything. In my view. One, it's the direction of this country. We cannot stay saddled with this current tax code. We're losing jobs right and left. We've got to change. Secondly, for Republicans you know, how hard is it for us to unite behind President Trump and deliver on our promises? Especially on tax reform. And I think Republicans are not going to disappoint.

The video sharing platform could have done a better job of communicating with content creators, he added. “What does this feel like from the community’s perspective?,"" Neistat said. ""It’s that advertisers are a bigger priority to this platform than the community.”

YouTube acknowledged Neistat’s concerns. “We watched Casey’s video and appreciate him and the wider community voicing their concerns,” it explained, in a statement emailed to Fox News. “We know this has been a difficult few months, and we’re working hard to improve our systems. We’re making progress, but we know there is a lot more to do.”

Earlier this month, YouTube pulled ads from a video posted by Neistat that announced a GoFundMe fundraiser for the victims of the Las Vegas attack. Neistat said that any ad revenue from the video would go to the victims.

YouTube’s policy is not to run ads on videos related to tragedies.

GOOGLE ANNOUNCES YOUTUBE TERROR VIDEO CLAMPDOWN

In his video this week, however, Neistat said that a Jimmy Kimmel video on the tragedy that appeared on YouTube featured ads.

“It sort of reeks of hypocrisy,” he said.

Neistat also urged YouTube to do more to promote the video site’s stars. “I do think that there should be a much broader initiative to show a real appreciation for what this entire community has brought to this platform and that is something I see very, very little of,” he said.

The video posted this week has been viewed more than 1.9 million times. Neistat averages between 2 and 4 videos per week.

Last year, CNN bought Neistat’s video app Beme for a reported $25 million.

YouTube, which has over a billion users, says that the number of channels earning six figures per year on the platform is up 50 percent year-over-year.

Sunwing said in a statement to Fox News that it uses the terms “Champagne service” and “Champagne vacations” to “denote a level of service in reference to the entire hospitality package,"" not the specific beverages that would be given to passengers.

The civil complaint filed on Monday accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of football and also named Riddell, the company that previously manufactured the league’s helmets that Hernandez wore when he was playing for the New England Patriots.

“Aaron experienced a chaotic and horrendous existence in many respects, due to his undiagnosed brain injury,” according to the complaint obtained by People Magazine.

The Hernandez estate also said CTE caused “aggression, explosive behavior, loss of concentration, mood swings, depression, apathy, and cognitive impairment.”

Riddell, an Illinois-based manufacturer, said it intends to vigorously defend its products and its reputation against concussion-related lawsuits

Hernandez hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell in April, five days after he was acquitted of the 2012 double murder of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. He was serving life in prison for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.

Boston University’s CTE Center announced in September that experts found the former football player suffered from stage three CTE. The disease has been shown to cause depression, violent mood swings and other cognitive problems in people.

“Hernandez had early brain atrophy and large perforations in the septum pellucidum, a central membrane,” the university’s center said in a statement.

The lawyers are seeking the damages on behalf of Hernandez’s 4-year-old daughter. The case was refiled in state court after the federal case was dismissed last Friday. The initial federal lawsuit claimed the NFL and the Patriots failed to ""disclose, treat or protect"" Hernandez from so-called ""repetitive impact injuries."" The Patriots have since been dropped from the lawsuit.

During his early high school years, Hernandez was known as a gifted athlete, but was also seen with a “rough-and-tumble” crowd, the New York Times reported. His father, Dennis Hernandez, kept him grounded until his death in 2006. His mother told reporters that she was worried the death would derail her son’s life.

Now, scientists are doing their best to actually spot the planet, but it won’t be easy.","We might not actually know how many planets are in our Solar System — and no, this isn’t a trick regarding Pluto’s status. For years, scientists have wondered if there might be a larger, planet-sized body lurking in or around the thick layer of debris called the Kuiper Belt, and now NASA is saying the evidence is hard to ignore.

The would-be planet, which would likely be a frigid place thanks to its position on the very outer edge of the system, hasn’t been directly spotted, but measurements of other known objects in the Kuiper Belt heavily suggest something is there. The only thing left to do is actually spot it, or verify that it doesn’t actually exist at all.

“There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,” Konstantin Batygin, a Caltech planetary astrophysicist, explains. “If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them.”

Simply put, the observations that have already been made all point to the existence of a planet that we don’t yet know about. The mythical Planet Nine is pulling on other objects in the Kuiper Belt, and causing them to behave in ways that match with the theory that an unknown planet is doing the pulling.

Now, scientists are doing their best to actually spot the planet, but it won’t be easy. Tucked away on the edge of our Solar System, it won’t exactly be the brightest object in the sky, and the only hope of capturing a glimpse of it will be to find its faint glow.

The Motion Picture Academy ousted him. Politicians donated his campaign contributions to charity (well, some did). ""Saturday Night Live"" finally roasted him. Soon, business will return to normal in Hollywood. And that’s the unfortunate part.

Hollywood elites will get back to their pulpits and preach the same message that not only allowed for Weinstein’s behavior, but continues to leave vulnerable Americans insecure and depressed. I’ve found that most of my friends raised on popular culture’s edicts of materialism and instant gratification are worse off. In fact, research shows that rates of major depressive episodes amongst millennials continue to increase.

Church attendance rates may be plunging, but—make no mistake—young people still hear sermons regularly, but we hear them in movie theaters instead of sanctuaries. And the new clerics are Hollywood writers lacing their scripts with the gospel of “do what feels right” and “have it your way.” However, the more we submit to our unrestrained desires, the more we are left with regret and despair.

As the son of a minister, I grew up attending church three to four times a week learning traditional, Christian values. My parents ingrained in me that an individual’s highest call is to serve God, family and country—in that order. They never insulated me from culture, but always warned me to stay leery of the messages I might hear. Fortunately, at age 23, I would still rather listen to one of my father’s lectures than a Jimmy Kimmel monologue any day. But most don’t have that luxury.

If cultural elites genuinely cared, they would introduce other worldviews that might lead to a more fulfilling, joyful life. My friends would hear more about the immeasurable fruits of lifelong commitment and responsibility.

As marriage rates decline, millennials hobble around from relationship to relationship (or worse: hookup to hookup) desperately trying to find purpose. Still, popular culture continues to sing the same tired tune. While my friends are hurting, all Hollywood’s doctrines have to offer are regurgitated lines about “find your own truth” and “discover the god-within.” It isn’t working.

My point isn’t to join the chorus of culture critics bemoaning the “me generation.” To the contrary, if cultural elites genuinely cared, they would introduce other worldviews that might lead to a more fulfilling, joyful life. My friends would hear more about the immeasurable fruits of lifelong commitment and responsibility. If the traditional values of faith and family were given a fair opportunity to compete in the free market of ideas, they wouldn’t be so easily dismissed as relics of the past. In fact, research already seems to vindicate them.

In a review of mental health studies, The Center for Research on Religion and Urban Civil Society found a positive link between religious involvement and greater “happiness, life satisfaction, and morale.” They also found that regular religious practice is associated with individuals having greater hope and a greater sense of purpose in life. There are even links between religious activity and reduced incidences of domestic abuse, crime, substance abuse, and addiction. While correlation doesn’t necessarily prove causation, there seems to at least be a strong connection between faith and emotional health – just as there exists a compelling link between family life and economic stability.

In “The Millennial Success Sequence” recently published by the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for Family Studies, researchers Wendy Wang and W. Bradford Wilcox find that “97% of Millennials who follow what has been called the ‘success sequence’—that is, who get at least a high school degree, work, and then marry before having any children, in that order—are not poor by the time they reach their prime young adult years (ages 28-34).” Their research shows that eight in ten millennials (86 percent) who have followed the sequence are in the middle or top third of the income distribution by ages 28 to 34—while only 29 percent of young adults who missed all three steps are in the middle or upper income groups.

The researchers conclude that millennials are more likely to follow the success sequence if they “have been exposed by family, friends, or members of their social network to norms, aspirations, and expectations that are conducive to education, work, and marriage.” It seems as though one of the greatest hindrances to economic success is culture. Citizens bound to institutions of faith and family seem to be better off emotionally and financially than their peers who subscribe to the teachings of secularism.

My parents gave me the greatest gift a child can receive in an era of uncertainty. They gave me a foundation.

Goodell shouldn’t care what the reason is for the insult.","It was a swing and a miss. No, that’s the wrong metaphor. It was a fumble. Trying to deal with the controversy over players taking a knee during the national anthem, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell failed to put the issue to rest.

Goodell explained in a recent press conference that the League believes “everyone should stand for the national anthem. It's an important part of our policy and the game. It’s important to honor our flag and our country and I think our fans expect that.”

But apparently he doesn’t believe it’s so important to honor our country that he’d actually require players to stand at attention. He thinks it would be great if they did, but hey, it’s their call.

Many fans seem to be deserting the NFL over the issue, with attendance and TV viewership down, so Goodell had to say something, and perhaps thought he could split the difference. But it’s hard to believe this will satisfy anyone.

The NFL tells its players (tells, not suggests) that excessive celebration after a play will be penalized. Yet deeply insulting behavior to the fans during the ceremony that starts the game is acceptable.

Let’s be clear — this is not a First Amendment issue. It’s not about the government telling the players what to do. It’s about their employers setting basic rules of conduct.

The NFL, for instance, tells its players (tells, not suggests) that excessive celebration after a play will be penalized. Yet deeply insulting behavior to the fans during the ceremony that starts the game is acceptable.

This is also not treating the players unfairly. This sort of thing applies to all jobs. If you work for, say, Federal Express, or McDonalds, while you wear their uniform, you’re expected to handle yourself a certain way. If someone orders a Big Mac and you start haranguing the customer with your views on abortion, the manager will tell you to stop it if you want to keep your job.

And this is not about whatever issues the players believe they’re commenting on. Entirely irrelevant.

Goodell earlier met with the players and spent time “talking about the issues player are trying to bring attention to.” Why? The players are free to hold whatever political opinions they wish, as is Goodell, and they can spend all the time and money they want fighting for their beliefs in their spare time.

But what they shouldn’t be doing is intentionally offending the fans — even for a good cause — or lecturing them, or waving fingers at them, when their job is to put on a good game.

Goodell shouldn’t care what the reason is for the insult. Whether it’s to protest police brutality or to protest taking down Robert E. Lee statues, it shouldn’t be the NFL’s policy to allow its players to be hurtful and rude to the people who ultimately pay their salaries.

Goodell stated “What we’re trying to do is stay out of politics.” Even if true (and how can it be when Goodell himself has said he’s committed to working with the players on social issues?), it’s a little late for that.

But the NFL has made its decision. Now it’s time for the fans to make theirs.",NFL Commissioner Goodell fumbles on flag policy,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/19/nfl-commissioner-goodell-fumbles-on-flag-policy.html

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

So hydrogen fuel cells could dramatically reduce fuel costs.","A team of Army researchers did not set out to prove that human pee could fuel U.S. military vehicles and bases in the future — but their unexpected urine discovery could transform how the armed forces get energy in the field.

A U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) team at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland believes it has discovered a way to use urine to provide power.

Soldiers can be required to carry more than 80 pounds on a typical 72-hour mission, and more than 15 pounds of those pounds can be batteries.

Could this urine discovery reduce the load a soldier carries by a whopping 20 percent?

In future war zones, soldiers may be using their own urine to produce electricity for the devices they need on the move — from drones and night vision devices to laptops and communications equipment.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

While urine could be used to power devices and greatly lighten the load for soldiers, fuel cells could also be used on a much, much larger scale like powering vehicles and theoretically even entire bases.

Why urine?

It is the hydrogen in the urine that Army scientists are keen to exploit to yield power.

They get the hydrogen by adding the ARL team’s special aluminum nano-powder to the urine, igniting a chain reaction that releases hydrogen.

In under three minutes, one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of the powder can produce 220 kilowatts of power from urine, researchers say.

AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR'S SHOW

Hydrogen is important because it has enormous potential to power fuel cells.

With hydrogen harvested from urine as fuel, the fuel cell yields electricity as well as water and heat, all three of which could be utilized by the military.

How do fuel cells work?

Fuel cells work like batteries. They contain chemicals and the chemicals are converted into electricity. With hydrogen fuel cells, the process of converting hydrogen and oxygen into water produces the electricity.

But fuel cells are different to batteries in the sense that they do not go dead or need to be recharged.

As long as there is hydrogen harvested from urine or elsewhere, the fuel cell will deliver endless electricity.

PODCAST: INSIDE THE SEAL TEAM 6 WORLD WITH THIS FASCINATING SNIPER

But why is pee important?

Why the excitement over this urine and hydrogen discovery? After all, hydrogen is one of the most common elements and can come from a range of sources.

AUSA 2017: THIS MILITARY ATV CAN 'THINK' AND DRIVE ITSELF

Hydrogen fuel cells could greatly lighten the load for soldiers so they would not have to carry battery weight anymore. But they need fuel for the hydrogen fuel cell.

One thing a soldier would always have access to in any war zone, anywhere in the world, no matter how remote and isolated ... is urine.

So this discovery could help pave the way to constant, easy access to fuel and power.

From Polaris MRZR ATVs to tanks, hydrogen fuel cells could be a future source of fuel. As far as military vehicles go, another fuel cell advantage is that they generate electricity quietly. By reducing noise, it could help reduce detection by enemy forces and enable a stealthier approach.

Again, with the fuel accessibility of urine, soldiers would always have easy, immediate access to fuel to potentially power a motorcycle or a Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).

AUSA 2017: THIS NET MAKES US SPECIAL OPERATIONS VEHICLES 'DISAPPEAR'

In some ways, Forward Operating Bases bear certain similarities to the International Space Station. Resources are very limited and resupply can be challenging since they are remote and difficult to access.

Energy is a vital resource there to keep critical tech powered.

If urine could be converted to provide fuel, then the base would have constant access to energy.

To resupply fuel to a base, soldiers can be exposed to threats like IEDs and attacks by enemy forces. With immediate access to an endless power supply through urine, fuel cells could put an end to the need to resupply conventional fuels and therefore reduce the risk to U.S. soldiers.

PODCAST: HOME DEFENSE AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILY LIKE THIS SOF SURVIVAL EXPERT

Other advantages to fuel cells

Hydrogen fuel cells are a very clean, efficient and effective way to produce electricity. If fuel cells can be cracked, they could truly revolutionize power for the military.

AUSA 2017 IN PICTURES

They are more energy-efficient than combustion engines — they can convert the fuel chemicals to electrical energy up to about 60 percent more efficiently, according to the Department of Energy.

It is also far cheaper to use urine as fuel rather than JP-8, diesel and other conventional fuels used in war zones. So hydrogen fuel cells could dramatically reduce fuel costs.

They also yield far lower emissions than their combustion engine counterparts. The only emission is water. While benefiting from the efficiency and cost reduction, the military could help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and air pollutants.

Discovery? The pee advantage

While the Army scientist team was working on developing materials and tech to improve capabilities for soldiers, they developed a special new nano-galvanic aluminum-based powder. When the powder comes into contact with water, it yields pure hydrogen.

But it doesn’t just work with water. Tests revealed that when the powder was added to lots of different liquids with water it also yielded hydrogen.

ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'

Their research was already important. And then they made an additional discovery — an unexpected one.

The Eureka moment? Urine.

With urine, there was a twofold increase in the reaction rates. So when the special powder was added to urine, it produced hydrogen far faster than even water.

What’s next?

The team is continuing to advance and also looking at how other fluids readily available to a soldier downrange could be harnessed — including saliva.",Will combat vehicles use urine for fuel?,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/19/will-combat-vehicles-use-urine-for-fuel.html

Obama added, ""it's the 21st century, not the 19th century.""

He made the comments as he encouraged Democrats to vote for Murphy, who served as ambassador to Germany during the Obama administration and is running against New Jersey Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno.

“You can’t take this election for granted, or any election, for granted,” Obama said. “I don’t know if y’all noticed that. But you can’t take any election for granted.”

He encouraged attendees to get their friends and family to the polls too.

“You got to get cousin Pookie,” the former president said to laughter. “You got to get, you know, you got to get Uncle Jimmy, he’s been on the couch, he’s drinking a beer, he doesn’t even remember it’s an election.”

In New Jersey, incumbent Republican Gov. Chris Christie is term limited. A Fox News Poll released this week of likely voters in New Jersey show Murphy ahead of Guadagno 47 percent to 33 percent.

From New Jersey, Obama is traveling to Virginia to deliver a speech Thursday night at a campaign rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, who is running against Republican nominee Ed Gillespie.

In Virginia, Democrats are also ahead, with Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, leading Gillespie, a former top aide to George W. Bush, 49 to 42 percent in the latest Fox News Poll. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe is also term limited.

In a January interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Pierre said Trump herself contributed to the design of the white, off-the-shoulder dress, picking out a “beautiful six-ply silk” for the construction and specifying the shape of the neckline.



""The lines are as sleek as a paper cut; the curves of the skirt are fluid, yet the overall shape is sharp and intense,” he told the magazine. “For me it reflects her personality.”

According to the Smithsonian, the tradition of first ladies giving over their gowns began in 1912 with Helen Taft, who donated the white silk chiffon dress she wore to her husband’s 1909 inauguration.

The automaker, which just started a major shift towards electric cars, is building an all-electric race car aimed at setting a record at the famous Pikes Peak hill climb next year.

The race against the clock takes place over a 12.4-mile course that climbs up a now fully-paved road to an altitude of 14,100 feet.

The current overall record is held by Sebastian Loeb, who reached the top in an 875 hp Peugeot in just 8 mins 13.878 secs, while the electric car mark was set last year at 8 min 57.118 secs in a purpose-built racer designed by Latvian bespoke EV firm Drive EO.

Volkswagen hasn’t revealed many details about its car, other than a shadowy image of the giant-winged coupe and the fact that it is all-wheel-drive, which likely means it has at least one electric motor at each axle.

Oppenheim’s boss, powerful NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, has remained silent as his subordinate takes heat for quashing the Weinstein story.","NBC News is coming under increasing criticism for its failure to investigate why its embattled president, Noah Oppenheim, spiked a bombshell story that would have been the first to expose Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator.

An NBC spokesperson says the network is not investigating the matter, despite new revelations that Oppenheim sat at small table with Weinstein at an exclusive New York gala in April, when Oppenheim reportedly already knew that his reporter, celebrity scion Ronan Farrow, had obtained damning audio recordings in which Weinstein admitted groping the breasts of an Italian model.

University of North Carolina Associate Professor Lois Boynton teaches ethics at UNC's School of Media and Journalism. She feels that Oppenheim sitting with Weinstein “certainly raises ethical concerns,” and while attending an event with a “Hollywood peer” may seem innocuous, the head of NBC News should have known better. Boynton pointed to the Radio Television Digital News Association and Society of Professional Journalists ethics codes, which are both clear about the need for journalists to work independently, be transparent and avoid conflicts of interest.

“Although Noah Oppenheim isn’t in the reporting rank and file, the impact of even perceived conflicts of interest on his part as NBC News president can affect not only his own credibility but also that of the company… It would have been wiser for Mr. Oppenheim to distance himself – literally -- from Mr. Weinstein,” Boynton told Fox News. “Perception carries a lot of weight. Human nature leads us to ask what conversations transpired between the two men during the gala.”

The revelation — which came from Hollywood mega producer Gavin Polone, who fingered Oppenheim as one of Weinstein’s “accomplices” — has been confirmed by Fox News and increased skepticism about NBC’s insistence that Oppenheim had no relationship with Weinstein prior to the screenwriting executive killing Farrow’s investigation, which Farrow would later take to the prestigious New Yorker magazine.

An NBC spokeswoman repeated that, “Noah has never had any relationship with [Weinstein], business or personal,” but it appears the pair were socializing in black tie at a star-packed event after Oppenheim became aware of damning evidence obtained by his own news organization. NBC did not disclose this fraternization when it issued its original denials last week that Oppenheim had any ties to Weinstein.

“It is problematic when those who are in charge of reporting the news in a fair and balanced manner appear in any way to be aligned with, or supportive of, news figures on whom they may have to report,” Canada’s Western University journalism professor and ethic expert Romayne Smith Fullerton told Fox News. “I think the very appearance of bias can be read by audiences as problematic.”

Oppenheim moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter, and has screen writing credits on three produced films, including “Jackie”, which was nominated for three Academy Awards (Oppenheim himself was not nominated). He is currently writing a screenplay about the escape artist Harry Houdini, to be produced by Lionsgate. He has told numerous colleagues that he’s bored by his NBC News role and may return to Hollywood full time at any moment.

Some NBC insiders who spoke to Fox News on condition of anonymity, for fear of retribution by Oppenheim, say he had a clear conflict of interest and should have recused himself from the Weinstein investigation.

Oppenheim and NBC News have also been accused by Farrow and many others of lying when Oppenheim claimed that Farrow’s piece did not meet NBC's reporting standards at the time they spiked it.

“One of the finest publications on the planet took a look at whatever Oppenheim took a pass on and felt it was worth the effort,” Poynter Chief Media Critic James Warren wrote.

NBC News is not even exploring why Oppenheim spiked the story, despite numerous calls from outside NBC (and anonymous murmuring from within) for him to step down.

“Executives at NBC knew exactly what Weinstein was doing nearly a year ago,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Monday. “Instead of reporting it, they did their best to keep that information hidden from public view.”

The pressure on Oppenheim has increased even as the Weinstein headlines have faded. Forbes published a story on Wednesday titled, “Should NBC News head Oppenheim lose his job over Weinstein expose debacle?” Breitbart Editor-at-Large John Nolte wrote that “hopelessly corrupt establishment media infested with Oppenheims is the problem,” noting that the system is set up for privileged and connected individuals like Oppenheim to remain exalted and remunerated. Evening TV news watchdog Andrew Tyndall called Oppenheim's rationale “lily-livered” and liberal CNN even quoted a source calling NBC’s decision “indefensible.”

Farrow had begun reporting on Weinstein in January of 2017 and by March he had “acquired a damning and much-coveted audio recording in which Weinstein admits to having groped an Italian model,” according to HuffPost. The same story alleges that Farrow landed an on-camera interview with actress Rose McGowan, during which she accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her, prior to uncovering the audio.

“By April, NBC News had two big scoops in its pocket: an on-record interview with McGowan and the explosive audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault,” the HuffPost wrote. “But Farrow was told by multiple NBC News executives and producers that the reporting and interviews he had conducted weren’t sufficient for a televised story.”

The Time 100 gala, which is packed with celebrities, occurred on a rainy April evening, after NBC News executives presumably knew about Farrow’s investigation. NBC News employees are given multiple invitations to the exclusive gala in exchange for promoting Time’s “The Person of the Year” magazine issue on the “Today” show. In addition to Oppenheim, “Today” hosts Megyn Kelly and Willie Geist represented the NBC cohort, along with NBC News chairman Andy Lack. Also there were Ronan Farrow himself and his mother Mia, the star of “Rosemary’s Baby.”

“I would say that yes it was unethical, both to sit with Weinstein and to pass on the story. Weinstein's ability to continuously harm women over the years depended on the complicity of other people in positions of power, who had the ability to draw attention to Weinstein's conduct. Refusal to work with him in light of that conduct would have brought this to an end long ago. The complicity is unethical; someone who turns a blind eye to a harmful act does something reprehensible, effectively facilitating it, especially if they gain from that complicity. Weinstein should have been stopped years ago, and many people are at fault for their passivity in the face of his actions,” author and ethics expert John Hacker-Wright told Fox News.

An insider familiar with the Time event told Fox News that seating assignments are carefully made, and that if Oppenheim scored a seat at Weinstein’s table, it was probably a favor by Time’s public relations department. An NBC representative tells Fox News that Oppenheim did not specifically ask to sit with Weinstein. Time did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

TV historian and journalism professor Robert Thompson doesn’t think Oppenheim and Weinstein simply sitting at the same table is necessarily a conflict of interest, but it all depends on what was discussed.

“I don’t know what happened at that table, I don’t know if there were conversations at that table… that might be another story,” Thompson told Fox News. “I’m not sure we know the details yet about what went into the decision not to go with that Ronan Farrow story.”

Thompson said he needs more information to proclaim that Oppenheim violated “journalistic standards” by sharing a table with the man his news division was investigating.

“Then, of course, there are standards as to, when you are in the middle of that, how you interact with the subject of your investigation. These are delicate things,” Thompson said. “I don’t know how the two of them ended up at the same table, was it just where they happened to find their nameplate? If the two of them were colluding about not running this story… that would be one thing.”

Boston University journalism professor Jon Klarfeld said Oppenheim’s decision “certainly was unwise” and called it “another notch in the list of problems” that TV news organizations currently face.

Meanwhile, Oppenheim isn’t the only influential member of the Comcast/NBC family to have ties to Weinstein. Back in 2013, the movie mogul attended an Obama event at the Martha’s Vineyard home of Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. The Weinstein Company has had TV programs on NBC Universal stations, and Weinstein reportedly begged NBC Universal executive Ron Meyer for support when the harassment allegations began to surface.

Oppenheim’s boss, powerful NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, has remained silent as his subordinate takes heat for quashing the Weinstein story. Oppenheim’s role at NBC is far smaller than that of his counterparts at other networks, since so much of NBC’s news operation reports directly to Lack. “He doesn’t do much other than spiking stories,” said an NBC News insider of Oppenheim, who was also in the middle of NBC’s decision to sit on the explosive Donald Trump “Access Hollywood” tape. That recording was eventually leaked to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, who is Oppenheim’s friend from prestigious Harvard University.

“Andy will try to throw Noah under the bus for the Weinstein and the Megyn Kelly situations,” said one industry insider, referring to the troubled roll-out of Kelly’s new daytime show. “But Noah is far more shrewd and connected than Andy realizes.”

NBC representatives did not respond to requests for comment from Lack. Farrow also did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment. When Fox News reached out to NBC for additional information, a spokeswoman responded, “We continue to believe Fox News’ coverage of this matter is motivated by competitive concerns.”",Pressure on NBC exec to resign after revelation he dined with sex creep Harvey Weinstein before spiking expose,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/19/pressure-on-nbc-exec-to-resign-after-revelation-dined-with-sex-creep-harvey-weinstein-before-spiking-expose.html

Well, besides being reasonable activities for a night out in Atlantic City, officials who help prepare specific sports for Olympic recognition apparently think they could soon take their place alongside running, gymnastics and ski jumping in the world’s most prestigious athletic competition.

Seriously.

The Switzerland-based Global Association of International Sports Federations earlier this month granted observer status to the International Federation of (Match) Poker, the International Pole Sports Federation and International Table Soccer Federation along with the organizing bodies for four other nontraditional sports — the first step toward joining the Olympic program.

“We warmly welcome our first Observers,” Patrick Baumann, the president of GAISF, said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for them and for us and we will do everything within our remit to help them realize their full potential as International Federations within the global sport’s family and, one day, maybe become part of the Olympic program.”

Baumann added: “The new sports debuting at Tokyo 2020 and at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympics are evidence that the pathway is there.”

Joining the program in Tokyo in two years will be softball, karate, surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and baseball — the games’ second shot at Olympic status. These sports were chosen, especially skateboarding and sport climbing, in part to reflect the changing interest in younger athletes and the worldwide popularity of these sports.

""Through these additional events, the Tokyo 2020 Games aims to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games,” Yoshiro Mori, the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said in a statement.

But pole dancing, foosball, aka “table soccer,” and poker?

These barroom pursuits, along with dodgeball, foot golf, kettlebell lifting and the previously mentioned sports, now all have the same status as sports like baseball and surfing once had.

Under the GAISF, observer status allows new sport to grow its base while being guided by the federation toward the requirements of membership, such as receiving the required recognitions by National Olympic Committees, increasing their membership and becoming compliant with the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

And for aspiring poker Olympians, don’t worry, cigarettes and watered-down cocktails are so far not on the list of banned “performance-enhancing drugs.”

So now that they’ve taken the first steps toward Olympic gold, when – or, more importantly, will – these sports make their debuts in the Olympics?

Before anything else happens, the sport needs to be practiced by men in 75 countries on four continents and by women in 40 countries on three continents be considered for the Olympics.

So the men’s division of pole dancing – surely equality demands that there be a men’s division – may run into some issues there.

Besides these stipulations, poker may face the same challenge imposed on chess by the International Olympic Committee with its ban on purely “mind sports.”

And even if dodgeball, foot golf, kettleball lifting, table soccer and arm wrestling can pass these tests, the IOC has worked in recent years to manage the scope of the games by only permitting new sports to join when others are discontinued. Meaning that these athletes might have to wait for sports like curling and table tennis to go the way of tug-of-war and water skiing.","Olympics may soon feature pole dancing, foosball and poker",https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/18/olympics-may-soon-feature-pole-dancing-foosball-and-poker.html

You'll go inside the ensuing Cuban Missile crisis and see how a nuclear holocaust was narrowly avoided between America and the Soviet Union. From the pilot himself, you will hear him retrace the mission of a U-2 spy plane that provided the proof the world needed that ballistic missiles were aimed at the United States.

And you'll hear from the ordinary Cuban citizens who fled from their beloved homeland in search of freedom.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""
There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun.
Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper.""","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared on Acculturated.com.

In their years on HGTV’s show, ""Fixer Upper,"" hosts Chip and Joanna Gaines achieved far more than merely getting Americans to embrace open floor plans and shiplap; they made marriage look fun again.

The Texas couple’s decision to end the show after soon-to-be-aired Season Five ensures it won’t devolve into them simply playing certain roles, trying to recapture the magic of earlier seasons.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

“This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,” the Gaineses wrote on their blog. “Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.” In a video accompanying their blog post, Joanna spoke specifically about how quickly the couple’s four children were growing, noting that their eldest was almost a teenager and expressing how they were ready to “hunker down with our kiddos” for a time.

This is exactly what made the Gaineses so appealing. They do care about time with their family—and they’re not the kind of reality TV professionals who want to turn their family into a permanent fixture on the screen by being “on” all the time. Part of the couple’s appeal has always been their family-friendliness, their down-to-earth qualities, and the clear priority they give to living in accordance with their values.

But their decision to end the show is also appealing because the Gaineses themselves have changed: in the years since ""Fixer Upper"" began, they’ve become involved in multiple home goods lines, launched a magazine, written a book, and even opened a bakery in their hometown of Waco, Texas. While I’m happy for the Gaines’ success, the fact is they’re not the same couple facing regular problems that they were when the show launched—and frankly, yes, a reality show true to their own current reality (exploring questions like what mega chain is worth trusting for a home goods line partnership, for example) would simply not be as relatable or enjoyable to watch.

But I’m grateful for the years they gave us on ""Fixer Upper.""

There’s a real dearth of shows or, frankly, any entertainment that depicts marriage as fun. And while no doubt the Gaineses amped it up a little for the camera, the dynamics under-girding the show—the push and pull between the goofy Chip and the more serious Joanna—certainly seemed authentic, as did the joy they had in just hanging out with each other, occasionally trying to get a rise out of one another.

Along the way, thanks to the pairing of Joanna’s gift for interior design and Chip’s skilled construction craftsmanship, they made a lot of beautiful homes—showing concretely how the teamwork of marriage could create something bigger.

In her 2011 book, ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" TV writer and actress Mindy Kaling included a section, “C’mon, Married People,” in which she wrote:

""I don’t want to hear about the endless struggles to keep sex exciting, or the work it takes to plan a date night. I want to hear that you guys watch every episode of The Bachelorettetogether in secret shame, or that one got the other hooked on Breaking Bad and if either watches it without the other, they’re dead meat. I want to see you guys high-five each other like teammates on a recreational softball team you both do for fun. I’m not saying that marriage should always be easy. But we seem to get so gloomily worked up about it these days.""

Kaling, whose own show ""The Mindy Project"" unfortunately devolved into a gloomy look at the hardships of relationships these days, concluded with the following plea:

“Married people, it’s up to you. It’s entirely on your shoulders to keep this sinking institution afloat. It’s a stately old ship, and a lot of people, like me, want to get on board. Please be psyched, and convey that psychedness to us.”

And that’s exactly what the Gaineses have done on ""Fixer Upper."" In an era when marriage rates are down, people flirt with notions of open marriages and polygamy, and singles scour Tinder for one-night-stands, a show about home renovation unexpectedly became a celebration of how a husband and wife could be friends and partners, could complement each other and have a genuinely good time just hanging out with each other. In their interactions with each other and their four children, the Gaineses proved happiness isn’t impossible for an old-fashioned family in our modern era.",What Chip and Joanna Gaines teach us about marriage,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/05/what-chip-and-joanna-gaines-teach-us-about-marriage.html

Johnson's gradual escalation of the war in Vietnam divided the country, overshadowed his domestic policies and forever tainted his administration's accomplishments.

“Executives at NBC knew exactly what Weinstein was doing nearly a year ago,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Monday.
An NBC representative tells Fox News that Oppenheim did not specifically ask to sit with Weinstein.
The Weinstein Company has had TV programs on NBC Universal stations, and Weinstein reportedly begged NBC Universal executive Ron Meyer for support when the harassment allegations began to surface.
Oppenheim’s boss, powerful NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, has remained silent as his subordinate takes heat for quashing the Weinstein story.","NBC News is coming under increasing criticism for its failure to investigate why its embattled president, Noah Oppenheim, spiked a bombshell story that would have been the first to expose Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator.

An NBC spokesperson says the network is not investigating the matter, despite new revelations that Oppenheim sat at small table with Weinstein at an exclusive New York gala in April, when Oppenheim reportedly already knew that his reporter, celebrity scion Ronan Farrow, had obtained damning audio recordings in which Weinstein admitted groping the breasts of an Italian model.

University of North Carolina Associate Professor Lois Boynton teaches ethics at UNC's School of Media and Journalism. She feels that Oppenheim sitting with Weinstein “certainly raises ethical concerns,” and while attending an event with a “Hollywood peer” may seem innocuous, the head of NBC News should have known better. Boynton pointed to the Radio Television Digital News Association and Society of Professional Journalists ethics codes, which are both clear about the need for journalists to work independently, be transparent and avoid conflicts of interest.

“Although Noah Oppenheim isn’t in the reporting rank and file, the impact of even perceived conflicts of interest on his part as NBC News president can affect not only his own credibility but also that of the company… It would have been wiser for Mr. Oppenheim to distance himself – literally -- from Mr. Weinstein,” Boynton told Fox News. “Perception carries a lot of weight. Human nature leads us to ask what conversations transpired between the two men during the gala.”

The revelation — which came from Hollywood mega producer Gavin Polone, who fingered Oppenheim as one of Weinstein’s “accomplices” — has been confirmed by Fox News and increased skepticism about NBC’s insistence that Oppenheim had no relationship with Weinstein prior to the screenwriting executive killing Farrow’s investigation, which Farrow would later take to the prestigious New Yorker magazine.

An NBC spokeswoman repeated that, “Noah has never had any relationship with [Weinstein], business or personal,” but it appears the pair were socializing in black tie at a star-packed event after Oppenheim became aware of damning evidence obtained by his own news organization. NBC did not disclose this fraternization when it issued its original denials last week that Oppenheim had any ties to Weinstein.

“It is problematic when those who are in charge of reporting the news in a fair and balanced manner appear in any way to be aligned with, or supportive of, news figures on whom they may have to report,” Canada’s Western University journalism professor and ethic expert Romayne Smith Fullerton told Fox News. “I think the very appearance of bias can be read by audiences as problematic.”

Oppenheim moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter, and has screen writing credits on three produced films, including “Jackie”, which was nominated for three Academy Awards (Oppenheim himself was not nominated). He is currently writing a screenplay about the escape artist Harry Houdini, to be produced by Lionsgate. He has told numerous colleagues that he’s bored by his NBC News role and may return to Hollywood full time at any moment.

Some NBC insiders who spoke to Fox News on condition of anonymity, for fear of retribution by Oppenheim, say he had a clear conflict of interest and should have recused himself from the Weinstein investigation.

Oppenheim and NBC News have also been accused by Farrow and many others of lying when Oppenheim claimed that Farrow’s piece did not meet NBC's reporting standards at the time they spiked it.

“One of the finest publications on the planet took a look at whatever Oppenheim took a pass on and felt it was worth the effort,” Poynter Chief Media Critic James Warren wrote.

NBC News is not even exploring why Oppenheim spiked the story, despite numerous calls from outside NBC (and anonymous murmuring from within) for him to step down.

“Executives at NBC knew exactly what Weinstein was doing nearly a year ago,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Monday. “Instead of reporting it, they did their best to keep that information hidden from public view.”

The pressure on Oppenheim has increased even as the Weinstein headlines have faded. Forbes published a story on Wednesday titled, “Should NBC News head Oppenheim lose his job over Weinstein expose debacle?” Breitbart Editor-at-Large John Nolte wrote that “hopelessly corrupt establishment media infested with Oppenheims is the problem,” noting that the system is set up for privileged and connected individuals like Oppenheim to remain exalted and remunerated. Evening TV news watchdog Andrew Tyndall called Oppenheim's rationale “lily-livered” and liberal CNN even quoted a source calling NBC’s decision “indefensible.”

Farrow had begun reporting on Weinstein in January of 2017 and by March he had “acquired a damning and much-coveted audio recording in which Weinstein admits to having groped an Italian model,” according to HuffPost. The same story alleges that Farrow landed an on-camera interview with actress Rose McGowan, during which she accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her, prior to uncovering the audio.

“By April, NBC News had two big scoops in its pocket: an on-record interview with McGowan and the explosive audio of Weinstein admitting to sexual assault,” the HuffPost wrote. “But Farrow was told by multiple NBC News executives and producers that the reporting and interviews he had conducted weren’t sufficient for a televised story.”

The Time 100 gala, which is packed with celebrities, occurred on a rainy April evening, after NBC News executives presumably knew about Farrow’s investigation. NBC News employees are given multiple invitations to the exclusive gala in exchange for promoting Time’s “The Person of the Year” magazine issue on the “Today” show. In addition to Oppenheim, “Today” hosts Megyn Kelly and Willie Geist represented the NBC cohort, along with NBC News chairman Andy Lack. Also there were Ronan Farrow himself and his mother Mia, the star of “Rosemary’s Baby.”

“I would say that yes it was unethical, both to sit with Weinstein and to pass on the story. Weinstein's ability to continuously harm women over the years depended on the complicity of other people in positions of power, who had the ability to draw attention to Weinstein's conduct. Refusal to work with him in light of that conduct would have brought this to an end long ago. The complicity is unethical; someone who turns a blind eye to a harmful act does something reprehensible, effectively facilitating it, especially if they gain from that complicity. Weinstein should have been stopped years ago, and many people are at fault for their passivity in the face of his actions,” author and ethics expert John Hacker-Wright told Fox News.

An insider familiar with the Time event told Fox News that seating assignments are carefully made, and that if Oppenheim scored a seat at Weinstein’s table, it was probably a favor by Time’s public relations department. An NBC representative tells Fox News that Oppenheim did not specifically ask to sit with Weinstein. Time did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

TV historian and journalism professor Robert Thompson doesn’t think Oppenheim and Weinstein simply sitting at the same table is necessarily a conflict of interest, but it all depends on what was discussed.

“I don’t know what happened at that table, I don’t know if there were conversations at that table… that might be another story,” Thompson told Fox News. “I’m not sure we know the details yet about what went into the decision not to go with that Ronan Farrow story.”

Thompson said he needs more information to proclaim that Oppenheim violated “journalistic standards” by sharing a table with the man his news division was investigating.

“Then, of course, there are standards as to, when you are in the middle of that, how you interact with the subject of your investigation. These are delicate things,” Thompson said. “I don’t know how the two of them ended up at the same table, was it just where they happened to find their nameplate? If the two of them were colluding about not running this story… that would be one thing.”

Boston University journalism professor Jon Klarfeld said Oppenheim’s decision “certainly was unwise” and called it “another notch in the list of problems” that TV news organizations currently face.

Meanwhile, Oppenheim isn’t the only influential member of the Comcast/NBC family to have ties to Weinstein. Back in 2013, the movie mogul attended an Obama event at the Martha’s Vineyard home of Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. The Weinstein Company has had TV programs on NBC Universal stations, and Weinstein reportedly begged NBC Universal executive Ron Meyer for support when the harassment allegations began to surface.

Oppenheim’s boss, powerful NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, has remained silent as his subordinate takes heat for quashing the Weinstein story. Oppenheim’s role at NBC is far smaller than that of his counterparts at other networks, since so much of NBC’s news operation reports directly to Lack. “He doesn’t do much other than spiking stories,” said an NBC News insider of Oppenheim, who was also in the middle of NBC’s decision to sit on the explosive Donald Trump “Access Hollywood” tape. That recording was eventually leaked to the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold, who is Oppenheim’s friend from prestigious Harvard University.

“Andy will try to throw Noah under the bus for the Weinstein and the Megyn Kelly situations,” said one industry insider, referring to the troubled roll-out of Kelly’s new daytime show. “But Noah is far more shrewd and connected than Andy realizes.”

NBC representatives did not respond to requests for comment from Lack. Farrow also did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment. When Fox News reached out to NBC for additional information, a spokeswoman responded, “We continue to believe Fox News’ coverage of this matter is motivated by competitive concerns.”",Pressure on NBC exec to resign after revelation he dined with sex creep Harvey Weinstein before spiking expose,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/19/new-calls-for-nbc-exec-to-resign-after-revelation-dined-with-sex-creep-harvey-weinstein-before-spiking-expose.html

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius.","A women's suit company has launched a racy new ad campaign featuring women in sleek, tailored suits alongside men in, well, nothing.

Dutch suit label Suistudio has taken their slogan “Not Dressing Men” to a whole new level by including buff, butt-naked men in the promo shots for their latest fashion line.

The photos show women dressed in well-fitted suits and clearly in a position of power, while the naked men are featured in the background and are almost used as a type of prop.

One of the pictures shows a woman sitting on a lounge, dressed in a beige suit, while she rests her feet on the naked man stretched out beneath her.

Another features a woman in a sleek black suit, lounging on a couch with her hand on a man’s bare butt.

The photos are all set in what looks like a luxury high-rise apartment, with the woman always front and center and the man in the background or half out of the frame with his face concealed.

The studio is using the campaign as a statement to highlight the sexist way women are commonly portrayed in advertisements, particularly when selling products aimed at men.

Vice president of Suistudio USA Kristina Barricelli said the pictures bring focus to the normalized way women are often sexualized and used as objects in advertisements — the men aren’t portrayed in any way that women haven’t been before.

“There is nothing wrong with sex, the naked human body, and the inclusion of that in a campaign. Sex is a big part of fashion,” she told online newsite Upworthy.

“The problem is that in recent history, we haven’t seen a naked man objectified in the background. How strange! Why not?”

The ad campaign has gained a lot of attention online and there has been backlash from people calling the ad out for objectification, claiming it is a step backwards in the fight for gender equality.

“I’m sure if the roles were reversed and this was published there would be a backlash from females saying that they are being [sexualized], objectified, abused and so on. But somehow it is OK to do the same things to males. Hypocrites,” one Instagram user commented.

“Sexism is sexism, no matter if a woman dominates a man or vice versa.”

“And revenge is not a way to overcome injustice,” another user said.

While some are calling out the ad for being sexist, others are saying it is empowering and praising the company for shedding light on gender inequality.

One user commented: “This ad campaign is genius. How many times have we seen a woman’s legs only or her bottom as a prop in men’s ad campaigns? All is fair in love and fashion.”

“Excellent cultural commentary! Love the irony,” another said.

Weinstein has denied the allegations.","Donna Karan is begging for forgiveness for the ""stupid"" remarks she made last week about the women accusing disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

The fashion designer suggested that sexual harassment victims were ""asking for it"" by the way they dressed.

Her comments on a red carpet touched off outrage online following sexual harassment and assault allegations against Weinstein.

Karan spoke to Women's Wear Daily in an interview published Monday, saying she spoke while sleep deprived and without knowing details of the mounting allegations against Weinstein, telling a red carpet reporter:

""How do we display ourselves, how do we present ourselves as women, what are we asking? Are we asking for it, you know, by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality? ... It's not Harvey Weinstein. You look at everything all over the world today, you know, and how women are dressing and, you know, what they're asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble.""

The designer told WWD, ""I made a horrible mistake. I regret it from the bottom of my heart. This is never who I am as a woman.""

Karan has been in the fashion business for 40 years, often championing women's causes. Her on-camera comments went viral, triggering outrage and a drop in the stock price of G-111, which owns the company that bears her name since last year.

The production company Weinstein co-founded fired him Oct. 8, days after he was accused of sexually harassing women for decades in an exposé by The New York Times.

Subsequent stories by the Times and The New Yorker included allegations of abuse, and more than three dozen women have publicly accused the disgraced mogul of abuse. He resigned from the board of The Weinstein Co. on Tuesday. Weinstein has denied the allegations.

The case prompted outrage across Germany, where high-profile crimes committed by asylum-seekers have drawn particular public scrutiny in recent years.

Wilson said Trump told Army Sgt. La David Johnson’s pregnant widow that he “knew what he signed up for…but when it happens, it hurts anyway.” Johnson was killed earlier this month during an attack in Africa.

But Wilson has often voted against legislation that would help veterans and their families, according to a vote-tracking website.

What is the feud between Wilson and Trump?

Army Sgt. La David Johnson and three other service members died in an Oct. 4 attack in Niger. Islamic militants ambushed the soldiers.

Wilson said she was riding with Myeshia Johnson, the soldier's widow, as they went to Miami International Airport to meet his body when Trump called. The president said Johnson “knew what he signed up for … but when it happens, it hurts anyway,” Wilson said.

The congresswoman called the remark “so insensitive” during an interview with WPLG-TV.

The fallen soldier’s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, told the Associated Press Wednesday that the congresswoman’s account was correct.

Trump denied Wilson’s claims in a tweet Wednesday.

“Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!” he tweeted.

FAMILIES OF FALLEN HAVE MIXED EXPERIENCES WITH TRUMP, IF ANY

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Wilson’s criticism “appalling and disgusting” and accused her of “politicizing” the issue. She said the call wasn’t recorded but other White House officials, including chief of staff General John Kelly, were present during the call.

But Wilson hasn’t backed away from her claim and later said that Myeshia Johnson told her Trump “didn’t even remember his name.”

""I was stunned when I came to work, when I saw what a member of Congress was doing, listened in on a phone call from the president,"" Kelly said Wednesday.

""It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation…I thought at least that was sacred,"" he said.

A spokeswoman says Wilson had no comment on Kelly's remarks about her Thursday.

What has Wilson’s voting record on veteran’s issues been?

VoteSmart.org, a site that tracks voting records, shows that Wilson hasn’t supported several measures that would have helped veterans and their families – including financially.

Specifically, she opposed a measure that would have given the families of four soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan in 2013 death and burial benefits.

TRUMP SAYS DEM REP 'FABRICATED' ACCOUNT OF CALL TO SOLDIER'S WIDOW, HAS 'PROOF'

She has also opposed measures to reform the embattled Department of Veterans Affairs.

And Wilson has voted against measures multiple times that would ensure veterans and their families would still receive benefits despite government shutdowns.

What else do we know about Wilson’s political career?

A former elementary school principal, Wilson was elected to Congress in 2010. She previously served in the Florida State Senate from 2002-2010 and the State House of Representatives from 1998-2002.

Her House of Representatives website lists several issues of concern, including education, gun violence, health care, immigration and jobs.

When it comes to Social Security, Wilson says that she ""will vote against any measure to privatize the program, cut benefits, or increase the eligibility age.""

This year, Wilson voted against the Republican health care bill.

In February 2015, she sponsored a bill that was introduced on what would have been Trayvon Martin's 20th birthday. The bill called for the House to press ""any State legislature to reject or repeal Stand Your Ground legislation.""

What about her personal life?

Her husband, Paul Wilson, died in 1988 after their three children were born, according to a Miami Herald profile.

In addition to her three children, Wilson also has five grandchildren, her House bio says.

She’s also spoken several times about her attire, specifically her penchant for wearing unique hats.

""It all started with my grandmother, whose name was Frederica also. She wore hats and gloves. I just wanted to be like her, so I started wearing hats. I just like to dress up, I guess, and I got that from her,"" Wilson told Roll Call in 2012.

“I’ve never counted, but I've been wearing them almost 30 years,” Wilson told Politifact in 2010. ""It's almost like a fetish. ... I have hundreds.”

Torrey Twane McNabb, 40, has challenged the humaneness of the state's lethal injection procedure. He was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 6 p.m. CDT, but the Supreme Court granted a stay after McNabb's attorneys filed a flurry of appeals. The justices could still decide Thursday night to go ahead with the execution.

McNabb was convicted in the 1997 shooting death of Montgomery police Officer Anderson Gordon. Prosecutors say McNabb was fleeing a bail bondsman when he walked up and shot Gordon five times while the officer was sitting in his parked patrol car.

McNabb and several other inmates have challenged the state's use of midazolam at the start of lethal injections, arguing that it violates Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment because the sedative would not reliably render them unconscious before other drugs stopped their lungs and heart.

A lawyer for McNabb has argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabb's lawsuit.

The attorney general's office has asked justices to let the execution proceed. The state has argued they have allowed multiple executions to proceed using the sedative midazolam and that McNabb presents ""nothing new"" to justify halting the execution.

With the Holden plant's shutdown after the last red Holden VF Commodore, a six-cylinder rear-wheel drive sedan, leaves its doors, 900 factory workers will clock off the last time.

Technical manager Peter Allison had been employed at the Holden factory for 19 years and had once expected to stay there for the rest of his working life.

""If we're not Holden fans, we're cars fans. Building cars is what we love,"" Allison said.

Thousands of jobs in businesses that have supplied components and accessories to Australian auto manufacturers are also at risk.

Though it's a subsidiary of a U.S. automotive giant, Holden is an iconic Australian brand and has been a source of national pride for generations.

The name came from English immigrant James Alexander Holden, who arrived in Adelaide as a 17-year-old in 1852 and set up a saddlery business.

The family business evolved from horses and buggies when the automobile age arrived. In 1931 GM bought what was then called Holden's Motor Body Builders. Such was the brand recognition that the Detroit headquarters decided to keep the Holden name.

The first mass-production model of the brand that became known as ""Australia's own car,"" the FX Holden, was built in 1948. A decade later, more than half the new cars registered in Australia were Holdens. The market was built on a reputation for cars engineered for rugged Australian conditions.

The reasons behind the demise of Australian auto manufacturing are numerous.

The first Holden cars were built in an era of high Australian tariffs and preferential trade with former colonial master Britain, which encouraged global carmakers to set up local factories to increase market share.

Australian import tariffs have since tumbled through bilateral free trade deals with car manufacturing countries like the United States, Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.

High wages and a relatively small population of 24 million people living far from large export markets denied the Australian industry economies of scale.

There were exports, including the V8 Holden Commodore that has sold in the United States since 2013 as the Chevrolet SS.

A decade of surplus federal budgets ended in Australia in 2008 with the global economic crisis. Car industry subsidies have since weighed heavily on the burgeoning budget deficits.

Holden, Ford and Toyota — the final three carmakers — announced their departures in 2013 when a mining boom made the Australian dollar for the first time stronger than the greenback. That made Australian-made cars increasingly uncompetitive.

Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull said a lack of government support was not to blame since the government had provided a total of 7 billion Australian dollars ($5.5 billion) in subsidies to the industry since 2001.

""The manufacturers who have progressively closed their operations in Australia have made it clear it's not because of a failure of government subsidies,"" Turnbull said when Toyota closed its doors earlier this month.

""It's because of changes in market taste. People stopped buying the sedans that were being made in Australia, or stopped buying them in sufficient numbers to support the industry,"" he said.

Ford shut its Melbourne and Geelong plants a year ago after 91 years of Australian operations.

The opposition Labor Party accused ""rightwing economic rationalists"" within the government of ""goading General Motors to leave Australia"" but refusing to guarantee future subsidies.

""We're not just losing a car, we're not just losing an industrial capability. We're losing an icon and that is a tragedy,"" Labor lawmaker Nick Champion, who represents the Holden factory region, told reporters on Thursday.",Australian car making to end soon with GM plant closing,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/19/australian-car-making-to-end-soon-with-gm-plant-closing.html

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them.","Thursday, New York Times columnist Charles Blow took liberal outrage to new decibel levels. His argument? President Trump is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

No, I’m not kidding. In Blow’s words: “Maybe I have crossed the ink-stained line of the essay writer, where Hitler is always beyond it. But I don’t think so. Ignoring what one of history’s greatest examples of lying has to teach us about current examples of lying, particularly lying by the ‘president’ of the most powerful country in the world, seems to me an act of timidity in a time of terror.”

Where to even begin? First and foremost, Donald Trump is indeed our president. There’s no need for quotations. He won nearly 63 million votes in November, in case liberals need another reminder. En route to victory, President Trump won union strongholds like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Not since the days of Ronald Reagan have we seen such crossover appeal. And, yes, he was democratically elected—even if liberal blowhards like Blow question it.

Second, why exactly is this “a time of terror?” If anything, the president is making it a priority to confront radical Islamist groups who have committed actual acts of terrorism. For the first time ever, the U.S. military is launching strikes on ISIS training camps in Yemen. Dozens of Islamic State militants were recently killed by U.S. airstrikes. Moreover, ISIS has officially lost control of Raqqa, the group’s self-declared capital in Syria, to U.S.-backed forces.

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them.

And Americans have President Trump to thank. From the travel ban to its rejection of the disastrous Iran deal, the Trump administration has prioritized our national security above all else—whether Blow wants to believe it or not.

But to evoke Adolf Hitler—the most reviled dictator in the history of the world—is a bridge too far, even for the New York Times. Mentioning his name in the same sentence as our president is not only intellectually dishonest—which even Blow acknowledges—but also insulting to the innocent civilians who suffered under the Nazi regime and their family members, who continue to cope with the sheer evil of Nazi atrocities.

Not that we need a reminder, but the Holocaust killed as many as 20 million victims overall. Millions more died fighting German forces to liberate Europe from Nazi authoritarianism.

In smearing President Trump, left-wing ideologues are disgracing themselves and the newspapers who continue to publish them. Blow argues our president is next in the line of “powerful leaders [who] use lying as a form of mass manipulation.” Yet the Times columnist provides no examples because he can’t. Even if he could, there is no comparison between a lie and the mass execution of millions of innocent civilians.

Shame on the New York Times for publishing such vitriolic content. It’s no wonder trust in the left-leaning mainstream media is at an all-time low. Less than one-third of Americans express even “a fair amount” of confidence in the media. After months of rabid anti-Trump headlines, only 14 percent of Republicans trust news outlets to do their job. With columnists like Blow in the fold, why would they?

What Americans do trust is the Trump agenda, which will make our country safer and revitalize our economy like never before. President Trump’s approval ratings are highest when it comes to handling terrorism—actual terror, not Blow’s definition—and managing the economy. It’s no coincidence consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2004.

The American people can take pride in a president who champions them, even as liberal snowflakes fan the flames of “resistance.”

Torrey Twane McNabb, 40, has challenged the humaneness of the state's lethal injection procedure. He was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 6 p.m. CDT, but the Supreme Court granted a stay after McNabb's attorneys filed a flurry of appeals. The justices could still decide Thursday night to go ahead with the execution.

McNabb was convicted in the 1997 shooting death of Montgomery police Officer Anderson Gordon. Prosecutors say McNabb was fleeing a bail bondsman when he walked up and shot Gordon five times while the officer was sitting in his parked patrol car.

McNabb and several other inmates have challenged the state's use of midazolam at the start of lethal injections, arguing that it violates Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment because the sedative would not reliably render them unconscious before other drugs stopped their lungs and heart.

A lawyer for McNabb has argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabb's lawsuit.

The attorney general's office has asked justices to let the execution proceed. The state has argued they have allowed multiple executions to proceed using the sedative midazolam and that McNabb presents ""nothing new"" to justify halting the execution.

Excess space is a luxury that most of us do not enjoy while our kids are living at home. But many of my clients find that once their grown children have moved out of the house and established their own households, they suddenly have extra unused spaces. At some point, those childhood bedrooms get cleaned out and stand waiting for a fresh coat of paint and a new purpose.

If you’re lucky enough to have extra square footage in your nest, here are eight ideas for turning that space into something fit for your current lifestyle.

1. A walk-in closet and dressing room. I love the idea of transforming an extra bedroom into a beautiful walk-in closet and dressing room. Several of my clients have done this, gaining both functionality and luxury. One client was even able to connect her new dressing room to her master bath — a nice perk if your floor plan allows. Many companies specialize in custom cabinetry and closets and can help you add this extra bit of comfort to your home.

2. A home office. Some people telecommute, others finish work projects or emails after hours at home, while still others simply enjoy having a dedicated home office for paying bills and taking care of other personal business. An extra bedroom is a perfect option for a home office because the door can be closed for solitude and focus or to hide clutter. You might line closets in the room with custom shelving and cabinets. Or, if this level of construction is not in your budget, you might purchase some beautiful storage solutions at furniture stores that can help you create a good-looking and organized home office.

3. A guest bedroom. Perhaps your adult children live out of town and stay for several nights when they visit. Or maybe other friends or family members often bunk in your home. A dedicated guest room might be just what you need. To make this a relatively inexpensive project, you might repurpose some furniture from a child’s former bedroom. A fresh coat of paint, new bedding, and updated accessories may be all you need to complete its new look.

4. A craft room. If you are someone who enjoys scrapbooking, jewelry making, sewing or similar hobbies, a dedicated craft room may be exactly what you crave. Frequently, craft projects span days or even weeks, and putting supplies away in the middle of a project can be cumbersome. Even if your funds do not allow for built-ins, a large table and wall shelving can work wonders for storing and organizing craft materials.

5. A reading nook. Maybe you have been longing for a quiet, comfortable place to relax with a good book — a small spare bedroom easily could be outfitted for this purpose. You may be able to relocate a comfortable chair from elsewhere in your home. Add a good reading lamp and a small book shelf and, if you want to go further, paint the walls a new color and add accessories, artwork and throw pillows. A cozy blanket in a bright color is another inexpensive way to add style to your reading spot.

6. An exercise gym. Outfit a small extra bedroom with exercise equipment and a wall-mounted television. Watching your favorite show while working out can make the time much more pleasant — I’m speaking from experience here. Also, large wall mirrors not only make a small bedroom appear larger but can help you ensure correct form and prevent injuries.

7. A yoga or pilates studio. With an available bedroom, a quiet dedicated space for yoga or pilates may be an attainable luxury. If your space and budget allow, enhancing a new studio by adding sliding doors out to a private garden is a wonderful way to create a special place with plenty of light and fresh air. A bubbling fountain augments the mood. Painting the walls a cool, calming color such as blue or gray can also boost the tranquility.

8. A multifunctional space. If you have only one spare bedroom but a variety of needs, a Murphy bed or wall bed may be the solution for you. Multiple companies specialize in beds that fold effortlessly into an attractive wall cabinet when not needed. That way, you can use your spare room as a home office, craft space or exercise studio without a bed taking up floor space — at least not until just before your visiting children arrive.",How to make use and better your life with a spare bedroom,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/09/28/how-to-make-use-and-better-your-life-with-spare-bedroom.html

So Richard Spencer, a loathsome racist with very little following, will get to talk.
There’s an old hippie saying: “Suppose they gave a war and no one came.” Well, suppose Richard Spencer gave a speech and no one came.","Every day you read another story about a speaker on campus being shouted down. The shouters apparently believe shutting up someone is their freedom of speech.

It’s not entirely surprising they think this, considering recent polls suggest more than half of college students don’t believe “hate speech” is protected by the First Amendment (and “hate speech” ends up being anything they don’t want to hear).

But at least they have the excuse that they’re students, and still have much to learn. What do you do when those who run the campus don’t know any better?

That seems to be the case at the University of Florida, where white nationalist Richard Spencer will be speaking on October 19th. His group paid to rent a facility at UF. Many students want to know why the event can’t be canceled.

This led to a message from University President W. Kent Fuchs, who wrote “If you are like me, I expect you are surprised and even shocked to learn UF is required by law to allow Mr. Spencer to speak his racist views on our campus.”

In 1992 the Supreme Court declared local governments can’t charge more than nominal fees for the use of public places. Otherwise, you’d have what amounts to a “heckler’s veto”—the greater the opposition, the more the government could charge until the financial burden prevented a speech.

Fuchs is shocked? Doesn’t he understand how things work? As a Q&A page put up for the event by the University explains, “As a state entity, UF must allow the free expression of speech. We cannot prohibit groups or individuals from speaking in our public forums except for limited exceptions, which include safety and security.”

Shouldn’t Fuchs know that, rather than be surprised by it? (And why does the explanation from the university seem so grudging? Shouldn’t it be more like “as an institution of learning, we aren’t afraid of letting others speak, even those we vehemently oppose?”)

Of course, many would like to use the safety and security excuse to keep people like Spencer from speaking. There’s such a threat of violence surrounding the event -- Governor Rick Scott has actually declared a state of emergency due to the speech -- that there’s an estimated need for half a million dollars in security costs. Why not charge it to Spencer?

The courts, however, recognize this as an end run around the First Amendment. In “Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement” (1992) the Supreme Court declared local governments can’t charge more than nominal fees for the use of public places. Otherwise, you’d have what amounts to a “heckler’s veto”—the greater the opposition to a speaker, the more the government could charge until the financial burden prevented the speech.

It should be noted that this 25-year-old case was decided 5-4 with the liberals in the majority. Perhaps this is because the Justices back then were old enough to remember an age when it was the left’s speech that was often shut down. Today’s left on campus is so dominant perhaps they believe only their opponents will ever be silenced.

So Richard Spencer, a loathsome racist with very little following, will get to talk. It’s quite possible there’ll be huge protests, and perhaps even violence.

But after all the complaints, and threats, try to imagine a different scenario — one supported by W. Kent Fuchs, by the way, after he got over his shock. There’s an old hippie saying: “Suppose they gave a war and no one came.” Well, suppose Richard Spencer gave a speech and no one came.

There’d be no shouting. No physical harm. No need to pay so much for security. Just a little freedom of speech. Campuses might even get used to it.",What if unrepentant racist Richard Spencer gave a speech and nobody came?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/18/what-if-unrepentant-racist-richard-spencer-gave-speech-and-nobody-came.html

Thomas Jefferson hand selected some of the most important books of his time for the library at the University of Virginia, which he created, and now hundreds of them are available to the public online, which is in keeping with what our third President believed: At a time when books were very expensive he thought it was the duty of the university to make great works available.

Many of his initial list, 7,000 books on topics ranging from Agriculture to Zoology didn't make it, lost in a fire in the 1800's, but thanks to a 40-year search by a librarian at the school, more than 330 legal works have been collected so that people today can read for themselves.

Asked by Fox News on Capitol Hill if the administration has been forthcoming about the attack, Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., replied, “of course not” and added, “it may require a subpoena.”

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Thursday that the attack is under investigation, and the Pentagon has dispatched a general officer to Niger to probe what happened.

While details are elusive, Fox News has compiled the following timeline of the ambush and its aftermath, which all started with a routine mission to meet village elders:

A dozen U.S. Army soldiers, mostly Green Berets, along with 30 Nigeriens, traveled 125 miles north from their base at Niger’s capital, Niamey, in unarmored trucks on a routine mission and to meet with local village elders in Tonga Tonga, near the border with Mali, on Oct. 4.

After the meeting with the village elders ended around dusk local time, the U.S.-led patrol was ambushed by roughly 50 militants from a new ISIS-affiliated group, Islamic State of the Sahel. No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, however, and a leading terrorist group in the region, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, has not been ruled out.

Islamic State of the Sahel’s leader, Adnan Abu Walid, is thought to have been holding an American aid worker from Niger hostage for a year.

A senior defense official told Fox News the U.S. troops were fired on once they were already in their vehicles. The vehicles then scrambled to “get off the X” -- escaping the ambush site using evasive driving maneuvers -- and a gunfight ensued.

At about 5 p.m. ET the Pentagon alerted the White House that U.S. troops had been attacked in Niger. Later that night, U.S. Africa Command confirmed in a statement “that a joint U.S. and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger. We are working to confirm details on the incident and will have more information as soon as we can confirm facts on the ground.""

Two U.S. Army Green Berets and two other soldiers were killed and two other Green Berets wounded. One U.S. Army soldier attached to 3rd Special Forces Group, Sgt. La David Johnson, had vanished — and it was feared he had been taken hostage by the terrorist group — until his body was discovered roughly 48 hours later, after an “intensive” search using both drones and U.S. special operations soldiers on the ground, a U.S. official debriefed on the incident told Fox News.

At the time of the attack, the Pentagon asked Fox News not to report a U.S. soldier was missing because U.S. special operations forces were headed to Niger for a possible rescue mission.

Fox News is told that during the search for Johnson, there always were either French, Nigerien or U.S. troops on the ground looking.

Special Operators were rushed to the scene as soon as it was known that a soldier was missing.

There was no U.S. drone overhead when the joint U.S.-Nigerien patrol was attacked because the patrol did not anticipate making contact with an enemy force.

“The patrol that was attacked last week had actually done 29 patrols without contact over the previous six months or so; no indication that this was going to occur. I would say that what was actually very positive about it was the fact that they were able to have close-air support overhead, about 30 minutes after first contact, which is pretty impressive,” the Director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., told reporters Oct. 12.

Two French Mirage fighter jets showed up overhead during the attack, but did not open fire on the militants. The jets, however, flew low enough to scatter the group. The government of Niger does not allow armed drone flights overhead, despite the U.S. military operating two drone bases and roughly 800 American troops in the land-locked West African nation, which is about twice the size of Texas in area.

Two French Gazelle helicopters arrived a short time after enemy forces scattered and one of them retrieved two wounded Green Berets and flew them back to the capital for treatment.

A short time later, a private U.S. contracted helicopter recovered the bodies of the three Green Berets killed in the attack, a U.S. official told Fox News. U.S. Africa Command confirmed the detail.

“Berry Aviation was on alert during the incident in Niger and conducted casualty evacuation and transport for U.S. and partner forces,” said Robyn Mack, a spokesperson.

In response to the event, which took place at the university’s Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, groups from around the state rallied to protest Spencer.

Many audience members booed Spencer and shouted over his speech. Protestors chanted phrases like ""Go home, Spencer!"" and ""Say it loud, say it clear, Nazis are not welcome here!""

""What are you trying to achieve then?"" Spencer asked the crowd, according to ABC News. ""You all have an amazing opportunity to be a part of the most important free speech event perhaps in our lifetime. This is when the rubber hits the road with the question of the First Amendment.""

Amid concerns that the protests could turn violent, Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., signed an executive order on Monday to declare Alachua County, where both Gainesville and the university are located, in an “imminent threat of potential emergency.”

There was also a provision to activate the National Guard, if needed.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., via Twitter asked “Gator Nation” to “embarrass [Spencer] by denying him the attention he craves” ahead of the speech.

More than 500 campus police -- the most in the university's history -- were on site during the event, University of Florida President W. Kent Fuchs told Fox News. The Florida Highway Patrol also monitored the event, as did police from other college campuses in the state, he said.

Overall, the university spent more than $500,000 to increase security.

Ahead of Spencer's speech, Fuchs was unclear about the exact number of people who were planning to either attend or protest the event, but said that those who show up in favor of Spencer should be “moderate in number.”

Fuchs encouraged anyone affiliated with the university to stay away from the event, warning that protesting would “draw attention to him [Spencer] and create what he wants,” he said.

As a public institution, the university cannot deny Spencer from renting a facility on the campus to host his event, as that would violate his First Amendment right to free speech. However, Fuchs did emphasize Thursday that “no one invited him, and the University of Florida is not sponsoring or hosting him.”

“He has given us [the university] a platform as well -- we can talk to the media about the value of inclusion at our school,” Fuchs added. “We understand what he represents and how it goes against our values.”

Who is Richard Spencer?

Spencer, who said his speech was intended to “wake up white Americans and white people around the world,” leads the National Policy Institute, a think tank located in Virginia that was founded in 2005. The think tank promotes an “alternative right” agenda, a term Spencer coined. It also publishes a journal called Radix, which promotes white culture and identity, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

Spencer, 39, became president of the NPI in 2011 after its founder, Louis R. Andrews, passed away, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Spencer is also the American editor of AltRight.com, a site he launched in early 2017 that promotes an alt-right agenda.

RICHARD SPENCER THREATENS TO SUE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA

Spencer, who grew up in Dallas, has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Virginia and a master’s degree in humanities from the University of Chicago. He later dropped out of a Ph.D. program at Duke University.

His education background helps him to promote his “image-conscious” strategy that appeals to educated, middle-class whites, according to the SPLC.

Why is he controversial?

There are numerous controversies surrounding Spencer.

Spencer’s main goal as a leader of the “alt-right” is to create an all-white America -- something he has called a “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” Critics have called Spencer an anti-Semite and a racist, among other terms.

According to the Washington Post, in a 2013 speech Spencer said “we need an ethno-state so our people can 'come home again,' can live amongst family and feel safe and secure.”

Spencer has rejected being labeled a Nazi, racist or white supremacist -- telling the Washington Post in 2016 that he prefers to be called an “identitarian.” In the same interview with the newspaper, Spencer was asked about his plans to create an ethno-state, a way of thinking that has been paralleled to Adolf Hitler.

“Look, maybe it will be horribly bloody and terrible,” he said at the time. “That’s a possibility with everything.”

The Anti-Defamation League has called Spencer a “symbol of the new white supremacy” -- Spencer has rejected conservatism and has instead envisioned a “new” right that embraces a “white racial consciousness.”

CHARLOTTESVILLE WHITE NATIONALIST RALLY BLAMED FOR 3 DEATHS, DOZENS OF INJURIES

Spencer gained media attention after a 2016 video of him saluting nearly 200 attendees at the National Policy Institute's annual conference went viral.

In the video, Spencer can be heard saying “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” Many attendees can be seen giving Spencer the Nazi salute in return.

Spencer, whose speeches at Texas A&M and Auburn University have sparked protests, ALSO participated in a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August to protest the city’s removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.

The event, which was met by counter-protesters, turned violent when a white nationalist protester drove a car into the crowd and killed one woman.

Spencer, along with other white nationalists, returned to Charlottesville earlier in October to hold a torch-lit rally to once again protest the statue’s removal.",Richard Spencer speaks at University of Florida: What to know,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/19/richard-spencer-speaks-at-university-florida-what-to-know.html

Earlier this week, Lewinsky tweeted #MeToo but did not elaborate.

The #MeToo hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano asked Twitter users to respond with that message if they had been subject to unwelcome advances.

Several women have accused Clinton of sexual misconduct, dating back to his tenure as governor of Arkansas. Clinton has only admitted to having consensual relations with Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers, and denied Broaddrick's allegation through a lawyer back in the '90s.

The system uses a camera and radar to allow a vehicle to steer itself in the middle of a lane on the highway, while maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of it. Nissan sales and marketing boss, Christian Meunier, said that he expects around 30 percent of Rogues to be equipped with the feature.

Unlike some competing systems, ProPilot Assist isn’t meant for anything resembling hands-off driving. It’s only there to make your life easier and safer, especially if you’re flaking out, hence the “Assist” part of the name. If it senses you’ve let go of the wheel, alarms will start going off within about 10 seconds with increasing urgency until you grab it again. If not, the system will slowly shut itself down and bring the vehicle to a stop in the lane it is currently driving in with the hazard lights on.

I recently had the opportunity to take a prototype Rogue fitted with ProPilot Assist on a short drive in New York City. It quickly locks onto lane markers and engages, but needs two well-defined lines to work. Faded paint will cause it to deactivate, as will the veering lines at exit ramps. It’s at its best in a center lane, where it holds itself dead center, even through wide radius curves. If they're too tight for the speed the vehicle is traveling at, ProPilot Assist will alert the driver to take back full control.

More impressive than its lane-keeping ability is the adaptive cruise control component of the system. This isn’t a new concept, but many cars so equipped apply the brakes abruptly when the car they’re following slows down or one pulls into their lane, often jarring passengers. ProPilot Assist has the same smooth touch as a very alert driver, and works in stop-and-go traffic, as long as the vehicle doesn’t stay stationary for very long.

Overall, ProPilot Assist is a step behind similar systems that Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac and Volvo currently offer, but is far ahead of anything available from Nissan's peers in the mainstream automotive segment. Nissan has sketched out a roadmap toward a fully autonomous car by 2022, however, so the abilities of its technology should increase quickly and dramatically in the coming years.

They quickly discover that there are unexpected and terrible consequences of dallying with death — but not everything they experience after ""dying"" is in the realm of science fiction. A growing body of research is charting the processes that occur after death, suggesting that human consciousness doesn't immediately wink out after the heart stops, experts say.

But what really happens in the body and brain in the moments after cardiac arrest?

The terms ""cardiac arrest"" and ""heart attack"" are frequently used interchangeably, but they are not identical conditions, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). During a heart attack, a blocked artery prevents blood from reaching a portion of the heart, which can cause that section to die — though the heart continues to beat, the AHA explained.

INSURER ALLEGEDLY SEND COVERAGE DENIAL LETTER TO 9-MONTH-OLD WITH BRAIN CANCER

During cardiac arrest, the electrical signals driving the heart's pumping action are disrupted, the heart ceases beating and death shortly follows, the AHA said.

In the vast majority of terminal cases, physicians medically define death based on when the heart no longer beats, said Dr. Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation research at NYU Langone School of Medicine in New York City.

""Technically speaking, that's how you get the time of death — it's all based on the moment when the heart stops,"" he told Live Science.

Once that happens, blood no longer circulates to the brain, which means brain function halts ""almost instantaneously,"" Parnia said. ""You lose all your brain stem reflexes — your gag reflex, your pupil reflex, all that is gone.""

A trajectory of cell death

The brain's cerebral cortex — the so-called ""thinking part"" of the brain — also slows down instantly, and flatlines, meaning that no brainwaves are visible on an electric monitor, within 2 to 20 seconds. This initiates a chain reaction of cellular processes that eventually result in the death of brain cells, but that can take hours after the heart has stopped, Parnia said.

Performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) does send some blood to the brain — about 15 percent of what it requires to function normally, according to Parnia. This is enough to slow the brain cells' death trajectory, but it isn't enough to kick-start the brain into working again, which is why reflexes don't resume during CPR, he said.

""If you manage to restart the heart, which is what CPR attempts to do, you'll gradually start to get the brain functioning again. The longer you're doing CPR, those brain cell death pathways are still happening — they're just happening at a slightly slower rate,"" he told Live Science.

Recent studies have shown that animals experience a surge in brain activity in the minutes after death. And people in the first phase of death may still experience some form of consciousness, Parnia said. Substantial anecdotal evidence reveals that people whose hearts stopped and then restarted were able to describe accurate, verified accounts of what was going on around them, he added.

""They'll describe watching doctors and nurses working; they'll describe having awareness of full conversations, of visual things that were going on, that would otherwise not be known to them,"" he explained. According to Parnia, these recollections were then verified by medical and nursing staff who were present at the time and were stunned to hear that their patients, who were technically dead, could remember all those details.

Death and beyond

Parnia and his colleagues are currently investigating the pervasiveness of consciousness after death. They're looking at large numbers of people in Europe and the United States who have suffered cardiac arrest, in the largest study of its kind, he said.

""In the same way that a group of researchers might be studying the qualitative nature of the human experience of 'love,' for instance, we're trying to understand the exact features that people experience when they go through death, because we understand that this is going to reflect the universal experience we're all going to have when we die,"" he said.

The study researchers are also observing the brain in detail during the period of cardiac arrest, death and revival to understand how much oxygen is reaching the brain, when exactly the cortex comes ""back online"" and how these experiences relate to brain activity itself, Parnia added.

For these scientists, the most important next steps are finding more accurate methods of monitoring the brain from beyond the threshold of death and improving the quality of resuscitation, to do a better job of preventing brain injuries while restarting the heart, Parnia said.

""At the same time, we also study the human mind and consciousness in the context of death, to understand whether consciousness becomes annihilated or whether it continues after you've died for some period of time — and how that relates to what's happening inside the brain in real time,"" Parnia said.

The ""Flatliners"" movie also suggests that death and resuscitation could enhance normal brain activity after revival, as the students who ""died"" and woke up can suddenly remember obscure passages in long-forgotten books. However, in the real world, a return ticket from death doesn't include newly acquired cerebral superpowers — though it does frequently provide a new perspective on life, Parnia noted.

""What tends to happen is that people who've had these very profound experiences may come back positively transformed — they become more altruistic, more engaged with helping others. They find a new meaning to life having had an encounter with death,"" Parnia said.

""But there isn't like a sudden magical enhancement of their memories,"" he added. ""That's just Hollywood jazz.""

Spencer’s appearance in Gainesville sparked controversy and preparation days earlier when Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for Florida’s Alachua County ahead of his speech.

Scott said a “threat of potential emergency is imminent” in Alachua County, where UF’s Gainesville campus is located.

UF President W. Kent Fuchs said Wednesday that while he believes in free speech, Spencer is “hijacking” public universities, which are compelled by the First Amendment to provide a speaking platform – and taxpayers are the ones getting hit with the unfair burden of paying the security fees.

Fuchs said a day before the speech that the school expected to spend around $600,000 for security. Spencer paid $10,564 to rent space at UF for the event.

Pots and pans sure look gleaming and gorgeous coming out of the box, but after years of spaghetti dinners, roast chickens and holiday feasts, a well-used cookware arsenal is bound to show its age. Make your sauté pans, stockpots and skillets worthy of the hanging pot rack once again with a little elbow grease and a couple of easy-to-find, mild cleaning products (including ketchup, of all things) — and learn how keep the glow once you've got it back.

Below you'll find daily care and stain removal tips for cookware made of stainless steel, copper, enameled cast iron and more.

Good practices for all cookware. No matter the type of cookware, it is best to wash it as soon as possible after cooking (cleaning as you go is ideal), and use the least abrasive cleaning method you can. Washing by hand is always preferable, even for pots and pans that claim to be dishwasher safe. Washing by hand will prevent the scratches and discoloration that can happen in a dishwasher over time.

The tips and techniques that follow are good general guidelines, but you may also want to check the manufacturer's suggestions. If your cookware is under warranty, using the wrong cleaning product can void your agreement, so it pays to do your homework.

Stainless Steel

Everyday care: Ideally, wash your stainless steel pots and pans by hand soon after use, using regular dish soap. That said, stainless steel pans are one of the few types that can handle a trip through the dishwasher — so if you are in a rush, don't worry about tossing it in with the dishes. Regular cleaning in the dishwasher may create spots or a cloudy surface.

Stain removal: To brighten up cloudy or spotty stainless steel, rub the surface with a rag dampened with white vinegar. To treat stains on the bottom of the pan caused by high heat, sprinkle a gentle scouring powder (like Barkeeper's Friend) on a wet sponge or rag to create a paste, and rub it onto the stained area. Rinse with water.

Copper

Everyday care: Wash copper pots and pans by hand, using warm, soapy water.

Stain removal: Bring that lustrous finish back to discolored copper by covering your pan with ketchup (yes, ketchup) or lemon. Let the ketchup sit on your pan for at least 10 minutes, then rub the discoloration away with a rag or sponge. Rinse clean with warm water.

Enameled Cast Iron

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool before washing it — a sudden temperature change may crack the enamel. Soak the pan in warm water first, then use a soft sponge and a mild dishwashing detergent to clean it. Do not use abrasive scrubbing pads, as they can damage the enamel finish.

Stain removal: Treat discoloration on the outside of the pan using a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. For tough stains on the inside surface, fill the pan with white vinegar and water and bring to a boil on the stovetop. Turn off the heat and let the pan soak with the vinegar solution, then wash as usual.

Hard Anodized Aluminum

Everyday care: Allow the pan to cool completely before washing it, and never place a hot pan in cold water, which can cause warping. Wash by hand, using a mild dishwashing detergent and warm water — putting your hard anodized pans in the dishwasher may void your warranty.

Stain removal: For stains on the outside only, use a paste of baking soda or a mild scouring powder, like Barkeeper's Friend. Rinse with warm water.

Nonstick

Everyday care: Use low to medium heat only — higher temperatures can permanently damage nonstick pans. Wash promptly with a soft sponge and warm, soapy water. If scratches or flakes begin to appear on the nonstick surface of your pan, recycle or toss it immediately. Otherwise those flakes will end up in your food ... not something you want to happen!

Stain removal: On the outside only, try using a paste of Barkeeper's Friend or a similar scouring powder.

Cast Iron

Initial seasoning: When you buy a new cast iron pan, wash it by hand in warm, soapy water. Dry the pan with a towel, then put it in a 300-degree oven for about five minutes to dry it completely — even a bit of remaining moisture can cause rust to form on cast iron pans. Next, using a paper towel, rub about a tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil over the surface of the pan, inside and out. Wipe away excess oil — you are aiming for a thin coat. Put the pan in a 300-degree oven for an hour, let it cool, then rub it all over with a clean rag.

Everyday care: Never use soap on your cast iron pan. Promptly after each use, wipe out the pan using a paper towel and a bit of oil. If food is stuck on, run the pan under hot water and scrub the food off with a soft brush or plastic scouring pad — remember, no soap! Soap will remove the seasoning, which is what creates that wonderful nonstick surface.

Stain removal and long-term care: For really tough, stuck-on food, boil water in your pan on the stovetop for a few minutes, then clean it as usual. Reseasoning occasionally will help maintain the finish.

Clay Pot

Everyday care: Most clay pots must be soaked in water for 15 to 30 minutes before each use. Always place your clay pot in a cold oven so the pot can come up to temperature gradually. Do not use your clay pot on the stovetop or under a broiler, and never put a hot pot on a cold surface — any sudden temperature changes can break it.

Clean it promptly, using a paste of baking soda; rinse with warm water. Soap is not recommended for unglazed clay pots, though you may be able to use a mild soap on clay pots that have been glazed; check with the manufacturer.

Stain removal: Try leaving a paste of baking soda on the discolored area for at least 10 minutes, then wipe away and rinse with water. Do not use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning products on a clay pot.",Essential cleaning tips for the 7 most popular cookware materials,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/essential-cleaning-tips-for-7-most-popular-cookware-materials.html

Brandon Bloom, 8, of South Setauket, on Long Island, became an NHL athlete for a day, Newsday reported.

The boy was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year. He has been undergoing chemotherapy and will be done with his treatment in August 2018.

BULL WRANGLED AFTER RUNNING LOOSE IN NEW YORK CITY

The special day was set up by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Random Acts of Light Campaign. The campaign’s mission is to “bring light to the darkness of cancer and create awareness for the critical need to find new treatments and cures for blood cancer patients,” according to its website.

Bloom called the day at the Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow “a dream come true” and revealed he was scared at first but “had a lot of fun.”

Bloom was given ice skates and a custom-made jersey with his name stitched on the back, ABC 7 reported.

The boy was able to perform drills on the ice and shoot a hockey puck with the team’s players. Bloom also scored a goal, which prompted the Islanders to celebrate around their new teammate. One of the players, Casey Cizikas, wrapped up the puck Bloom shot with tape and wrote on it “1st NHL goal” before giving it to the boy.

In 2014, the American Humanist Association -- a group that believes in ""being good without a god"" -- filed a lawsuit alleging the cross-shaped memorial is unconstitutional and demanding it be demolished, altered, or removed.

On Wednesday, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and ruled the historic memorial must be torn down -- all because the Bladensburg Memorial is in the shape of a cross.

The Fourth Circuit said the memorial excessively entangles the government in religion because the cross is the “core symbol of Christianity” and “breaches” the wall separating church and state.

Writing separately, Chief Judge Gregory wrote, “This Memorial stands in witness to the VALOR, ENDURANCE, COURAGE, and DEVOTION of the forty-nine residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland ‘who lost their lives in the Great War for the liberty of the world.’ I cannot agree that a monument so conceived and dedicated and that bears such witness violates the letter or spirit of the very Constitution these heroes died to defend.”

Asked by Fox News on Capitol Hill if the administration has been forthcoming about the attack, Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., replied, “of course not” and added, “it may require a subpoena.”

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Thursday that the attack is under investigation, and the Pentagon has dispatched a general officer to Niger to probe what happened.

While details are elusive, Fox News has compiled the following timeline of the ambush and its aftermath, which all started with a routine mission to meet village elders:

A dozen U.S. Army soldiers, mostly Green Berets, along with 30 Nigeriens, traveled 125 miles north from their base at Niger’s capital, Niamey, in unarmored trucks on a routine mission and to meet with local village elders in Tonga Tonga, near the border with Mali, on Oct. 4.

After the meeting with the village elders ended around dusk local time, the U.S.-led patrol was ambushed by roughly 50 militants from a new ISIS-affiliated group, Islamic State of the Sahel. No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack, however, and a leading terrorist group in the region, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, has not been ruled out.

Islamic State of the Sahel’s leader, Adnan Abu Walid, is thought to have been holding an American aid worker from Niger hostage for a year.

A senior defense official told Fox News the U.S. troops were fired on once they were already in their vehicles. The vehicles then scrambled to “get off the X” -- escaping the ambush site using evasive driving maneuvers -- and a gunfight ensued.

At about 5 p.m. ET the Pentagon alerted the White House that U.S. troops had been attacked in Niger. Later that night, U.S. Africa Command confirmed in a statement “that a joint U.S. and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger. We are working to confirm details on the incident and will have more information as soon as we can confirm facts on the ground.""

Two U.S. Army Green Berets and two other soldiers were killed and two other Green Berets wounded. One U.S. Army soldier attached to 3rd Special Forces Group, Sgt. La David Johnson, had vanished — and it was feared he had been taken hostage by the terrorist group — until his body was discovered roughly 48 hours later, after an “intensive” search using both drones and U.S. special operations soldiers on the ground, a U.S. official debriefed on the incident told Fox News.

At the time of the attack, the Pentagon asked Fox News not to report a U.S. soldier was missing because U.S. special operations forces were headed to Niger for a possible rescue mission.

Fox News is told that during the search for Johnson, there always were either French, Nigerien or U.S. troops on the ground looking.

Special Operators were rushed to the scene as soon as it was known that a soldier was missing.

There was no U.S. drone overhead when the joint U.S.-Nigerien patrol was attacked because the patrol did not anticipate making contact with an enemy force.

“The patrol that was attacked last week had actually done 29 patrols without contact over the previous six months or so; no indication that this was going to occur. I would say that what was actually very positive about it was the fact that they were able to have close-air support overhead, about 30 minutes after first contact, which is pretty impressive,” the Director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., told reporters Oct. 12.

Two French Mirage fighter jets showed up overhead during the attack, but did not open fire on the militants. The jets, however, flew low enough to scatter the group. The government of Niger does not allow armed drone flights overhead, despite the U.S. military operating two drone bases and roughly 800 American troops in the land-locked West African nation, which is about twice the size of Texas in area.

Two French Gazelle helicopters arrived a short time after enemy forces scattered and one of them retrieved two wounded Green Berets and flew them back to the capital for treatment.

A short time later, a private U.S. contracted helicopter recovered the bodies of the three Green Berets killed in the attack, a U.S. official told Fox News. U.S. Africa Command confirmed the detail.

“Berry Aviation was on alert during the incident in Niger and conducted casualty evacuation and transport for U.S. and partner forces,” said Robyn Mack, a spokesperson.

Despite having the fastest processor and best camera ever put into an iPhone, plus featuring wireless charging for the first time, the iPhone 8 hasn’t been getting consumers into stores at the rate Apple is accustomed to.

Much of this can be attributed to the fact the handset is very similar in appearance to the iPhone 7, which sells for $150 less and can still hold its own against the market’s current offerings.

Spam — which is especially popular in Hawaii — is now being treated like a luxury item as people keep stealing cans of the cooked meat by the caseload from shops all over the islands.

In Honolulu, police are offering a $1,000 reward for a man who entered a store earlier this month and grabbed a case of Spam. The suspect (and an apparent accomplice) punched a security guard who tried to stop him, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

Similar thefts have been popping up elsewhere.

In the Pearl City section of Oahu, a suspect grabbed eight cases of Spam and dashed out of a supermarket at full speed.

“That’s when I thought, ‘OK, this isn’t real. No, he’s not going to take it, no, no,” customer Arlene Sua told KHON. “Next thing I knew once he passed the register, that’s when I heard the intercom [call] management to the front and it was really fast.”

Tina Yamaki, president of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii, told the Washington Post that the thieves are probably targeting Spam to sell it on the black market to make a quick cash.

“We’ve heard they work through middlemen. We’ve heard that they’re selling if from the back of their cars,” she said. “We’ve heard all kinds of rumors. Whether they’re true or not, I’m not sure.”

Now, businesses are putting the product in plastic cases under lock and key — right next to high-tech products like phones and cameras.

As many Democrats weaponize Gold Star families against the GOP, mainstream media outlets now seem to be approaching the families of dead soldiers one by one in an attempt to find the next controversy surrounding President Trump.

Earlier this week, Trump said former President Obama and past presidents didn’t always call the families of soldiers who died while serving the country during a Rose Garden press conference.

“The traditional way, if you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn’t make calls, a lot of them didn’t make calls,” Trump said. “I like to call when it’s appropriate.”

These comments by Trump lit a fire under Democrats, both in the media and in Washington.

The list is out of Forbes 400 Richest Americans and it shows that the commander in chief's wealth dropped by $600 million to $3.1 billion.

As a result, President Trump's ranking is now at No. 248 on the list, after coming in at 156 last year. The magazine attributes his ""decline in wealth to challenging New York real estate market, a costly lawsuit and an expensive presidential campaign.""

The study is believed to be the first to directly compare Vivitrol — administered as a monthly shot — with a combination drug treatment sold under the brand name Suboxone. In the U.S. and many other countries, Suboxone or methadone have been the standard medical treatment for people with an opioid use disorder.

Researchers in Norway found the two treatments were similar in terms of safety and efficacy in helping opioid-dependent people refrain from illicit drug use during a three-month period.

The results may provide a boost to Vivitrol manufacturer Alkermes Inc., which has been aggressively promoting the medication following its 2010 approval as a treatment for opioid-dependence relapse.

Many addiction specialists, however, are waiting for more research before considering Vivitrol as a treatment option. A larger study comparing Vivitrol and Suboxone, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, is expected to be released in December. That study also tracks subjects for a longer period of time. Several other studies are also underway.

The two treatments work in different ways. Vivitrol, which is a version of the drug naltrexone, blocks the euphoric and sedative effects of opioids. Suboxone is an opioid — comprised of buprenorphine and a small amount of naloxone — that produces less of an euphoric effect than other opioids like heroin. Suboxone and methadone have been well-studied and shown to be effective in keeping people in treatment and reducing illicit opioid use.

The federal government has called for expanded access to medications for treating opioid abuse. Most inpatient treatment facilities in the U.S. remain abstinence-based, despite high relapse rates associated with that approach.

“The message is that there are two ways into rehabilitation of opioid- or heroin-dependent individuals,” said one of the study authors, Dr. Lars Tanum of the Norwegian Center for Addiction Research. “You can keep them on low-harm opioids or give them opioid-blocking treatment.”

Some people are opposed to the use of Suboxone and methadone because they are themselves opioids — and in most cases, must be taken daily.

People taking these medications can function at a high level and are not considered addicted. But Tanum said in some countries, including Norway, people using Suboxone as a treatment for opioid dependence are barred from certain jobs, such as operating heavy machinery, or driving a car.

In the U.S., Alkermes has heavily marketed Vivitrol to drug court judges and prison officials. Some in law enforcement favor the use of Vivitrol because of the fact it is not an opioid and given monthly. Others have been critical of that approach, saying it unfairly stigmatizes the effective use of Suboxone and methadone in treating people with opioid use disorders. In June, the U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed records from Alkermes related to Vivitrol.

The Norwegian study randomly split 159 patients into two groups, one receiving Vivitrol and the other Suboxone. The study participants knew which treatment they were receiving, which can bias results. The researchers reported patients in both groups stayed in the study for similar lengths of time — a little over two months, on average. About a third of the patients dropped out of the study. There was little difference between the two groups in the number of patients testing positive for illicit drug use during the study.

The authors reported no corporate funding of the study, or payments to researchers, but noted Alkermes was allowed to comment on the manuscript before it was submitted for publication. Alkermes also provided the Vivitrol used in the study. Tanum said the comments from the company were limited to technical aspects of the drug, including making sure the approved indication for Vivitrol was stated correctly.","Once-a-month shot for opioid addiction works as well as daily medication, study finds",https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/10/19/once-month-shot-for-opioid-addiction-works-as-well-as-daily-medication-study-finds.html

“We are not afraid of the tough conversations,” he added. “Out of those discussions, [players] understand that owners and the NFL do really care about the issues.”

Asked about owners who threatened discipline for players who didn't stand, Goodell said the owners didn't discuss it.

A couple hours later, Trump tweeted his thoughts to the NFL in no uncertain terms: “Too much talk, not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem.”

Goodell, who has been in New York City with teams owners for their annual fall meeting, defended the athletes who have been taking a knee in protest, saying they are “not doing this to be disrespectful to the flag, but they understand how it’s being interpreted.”

“We want our players to stand. We’re going to continue to encourage them to stand,” he said.

Last week, Goodell sent a memo to NFL executives and club presidents aiming to move past the weeks-long feud between the White House and players.

“The current dispute over the national anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” he wrote last week. “Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem.

On Wednesday, Goodell said the league is working with its players to see how it can continue to support them and how changes can be made in their communities.

“They are very clear about and very knowledgeable about [what needs change],” he said.

The “take a knee” movement — protesting police brutality and other issues — began when Colin Kaepernick first sat for the anthem during the NFL preseason in early August 2016.

The New York Times reported that as recent as last week, these ads were found on sites like PolitiFact and Snopes.

The report said the ads took the reader to sites that looked like major media websites, like Vogue and People. The headlines read, for example, “Melania Trump is leaving the White House!”

The articles looks similar to a standard news site, but they transitioned to an ad. In one case, an anti-aging skin cream, the report said.

Nearly a year after Facebook and Google launched offensives against fake news, they’re still inadvertently promoting it — often at the worst possible times.

Online services designed to engross users aren’t so easily retooled to promote greater accuracy, it turns out. Especially with online trolls, pranksters and more malicious types scheming to evade new controls as they’re rolled out.

In the immediate aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Facebook’s “Crisis Response” page for the attack featured a false article misidentifying the gunman and claiming he was a “far left loon.” Google promoted a similarly erroneous item from the anonymous prankster site 4chan in its “Top Stories” results.

A day after the attack, a YouTube search on “Las Vegas shooting” yielded a conspiracy-theory video that claimed multiple shooters were involved in the attack as the fifth result. YouTube is owned by Google.

None of these stories were true. Police identified the sole shooter as Stephen Paddock, a Nevada man whose motive remains a mystery . The Oct. 1 attack on a music festival left 58 dead and hundreds wounded.

The companies quickly purged offending links and tweaked their algorithms to favor more authoritative sources. But their work is clearly incomplete — a different Las Vegas conspiracy video was the eighth result displayed by YouTube in a search Monday.

“As always, when we find deceptive ad practices on our platforms we move swiftly to take action, including suspending the advertiser account if appropriate,” Chi Hea Cho, a Google spokeswoman, told The Times in a statement. “In addition, we give publishers controls so they can block specific types of ads and advertisers.”

The Board of Trustees voted 10-3 on Wednesday to fire Jurich after 20 years as the school’s AD. Jurich, 61, had been placed on paid administrative Sept. 27 by interim university President Greg Postel. Louisville’s Athletic Association fired men’s basketball coach Rick Pitino on Monday.

Jurich shepherded Louisville’s 2014 entry into the Atlantic Coast Conference. He also was responsible for facility upgrades and saw numerous sports thrive under coaches he hired.

Vince Tyra was named acting AD since Oct. 3, a move the Athletic Association approved on Monday before firing Pitino.

Louisville’s acknowledgment of being part of a federal probe into bribery of college recruits proved to be Jurich’s undoing. Postel’s Sept. 27 disciplinary letter to the AD called allegations in the complaint “disturbing and unprecedented.” His letter also called “unacceptable” the level of misconduct, alleged criminal activity and the negative attention it has brought to Louisville.

Postel also criticized Jurich for failing to update or consult the athletic board about his negotiation of the department’s sponsorship extension with Adidas.

Jurich’s lawyer, Alison M. Stemler, disputed Postel’s allegations in a letter that also questioned whether school’s disciplinary action might violate a contract clause.

Several Jurich supporters carrying signs urging trustees to retain the AD gathered outside the Grawemeyer administration building and briefly inside the meeting room. Jurich’s attorney, Alison M. Stemler, and members of Jurich’s legal team joined the meeting shortly after it began.

Trustees ultimately followed the same path as the ULAA, deciding to part ways with Jurich and move forward.

Jurich departs as construction continues on a $63 million expansion of the football stadium due for completion by next season. He had a long record of accomplishments that helped Louisville build one of the nation’s top athletic programs.

Jurich also remained loyal to coaches he hired, to a fault in some cases.

Jurich hired Pitino as coach in 2001 and celebrated Louisville’s third NCCA men’s basketball championship trophy 12 years later in perhaps the school’s most successful year in athletics.

The Cardinals’ women’s basketball team reached the NCAA championship game that same season and has remained a perennial NCAA Tournament contender. Both programs play in a 22,000-seat downtown arena that opened in 2010.

Lamar Jackson became Louisville’s first Heisman Trophy winner last year when the Cardinals flirted with a berth in the college football playoff. The Cardinals in 1998 began playing in Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium, which is undergoing its second expansion from its original 42,000-seat capacity.

The baseball team is coming off its third College World Series berth in five years and is also preparing to expand its stadium.

Jurich was scrutinized for his decision to re-hire football coach Bobby Petrino in January 2014, less than two years after Arkansas fired Petrino for misleading school officials about a motorcycle accident in which his passenger was later revealed to be his mistress.

“Parents need to chill out a little bit.”This article originally appeared on the New York Post.","The scariest thing this Halloween for New York moms isn’t zombies or ghouls — it’s politically incorrect costumes.

An article on raceconscious.org by Sachi Feris has been making the rounds on mommy Facebook groups. Feris writes that her 5-year-old daughter declared she wanted to be Polynesian Disney character Moana, which she worried would be “cultural appropriation.”

Her daughter’s other choice: Scandinavian Queen Elsa from the Disney movie “Frozen.”

“I had some reservations regarding both costume choices … about cultural appropriation and the power/privilege carried by Whiteness, and about Whiteness and standards of beauty,” she wrote.

Feris went on to describe a series of conversations with her daughter, particularly focusing on the ethics of dressing as Moana, who as a teen sets out on a treacherous sea journey to save her family’s island from famine and destruction — and succeeds.

In the end, Feris’s daughter decided to dress as Elsa — though Feris was concerned it might teach her short-haired brunette daughter that one must be white, blue-eyed and have long flaxen hair to be a “beautiful” princess.

But she nixed the Moana costume for Mickey Mouse, because, as Ferris wrote, “we don’t have to worry about making fun of anyone or dressing up as a culture different from our own because Mickey Mouse is a pretend mouse!

“One thing is for sure, our discussions around appropriate and inappropriate Halloween costumes will continue,” concluded Feris.

Her blog was almost universally praised by commenters. Yvette Brown, wrote: “I admire your perseverance in interacting with your daughter. … You also have given her essential values along with guidelines so she has the opportunity to grow, be creative, learn and find her way in the world.”

But another commenter named Amanda expressed reservations. “This feels murky,” she wrote. “I recognize the need to be sensitive, I’m just wondering how you parse the nuances for a child.”

Meanwhile, a New York mom of one daughter told The Post: “I think it’s silly to take children’s Halloween costumes so seriously. They’re kids, can’t they just be kids and not involved with the whole political correctness thing?

“Parents need to chill out a little bit.”

Opinion polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for nearly two decades, will win reelection comfortably if he decides to seek what would be his fourth term in March.

However, a significant minority of voters accuse him of overseeing a corrupt system that has isolated Russia from the rest of the world.

Many of them have taken part in mass protests organized by Putin critic Alexei Navalny.

Russian officials say Navalny is ineligible to run for president due to a criminal conviction which has left an opening for a genuine opponent.

Sobchak is seen by many as an alternative option to those that have had enough of Putin.

The reality TV star, who has been described by Vogue magazine as the Russian version of socialite Paris and is the daughter of Putin’s former mentor, said she had decided to run because she was tired of the same politicians, including Putin, running year after year.

The 35-year-old said she had the right to run for Russia’s top political job under the country’s constitution, which stipulates that all candidates must be 35 or older.

“I decided to exercise that right because I am against all of those (candidates) who usually exercise that right,” she said.

“When I was 18 and was studying in university, Vladimir Putin became president of Russia. Children who were born that year will go and vote themselves this year. Just think about that.”

But some Russian liberals fear Sobchak’s participation will play into the Kremlin’s hands by splitting the opposition vote.

Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist former mayor of St. Petersburg who hired Putin as an official in City Hall in the 1990s.

Sobchak, who died in 2000, became a mentor to Putin. Sobchak’s mother, Lyudmila Narusova, sits in the upper house of the Russian parliament.

Sobchak’s Instagram account, often featuring photographs of her dressed in designer outfits and appearing at glitzy society events, has 5.2 million followers.

After graduating from the prestigious MGIMO University in Moscow, she became a nationwide celebrity when she hosted a Russian reality TV show called Dom 2.

She became active in opposition politics around the time that Putin, in 2012, was reelected to the presidency after stepping down for four years to comply with constitutional term limits.

Sophie, who had a softball-sized mass in her chest at the time of diagnosis, has been receiving treatment at Children’s Medical Center in Dallas.

“I see all of those rubber bracelets on your arms and wrapped around your stethoscope, each one for a child that you’ve cared for and loved,” Skiles wrote to the nurses. “I see you carrying arm loads of medicine and supplies into one child’s room all while your phone is ringing in your pocket from the room of another.

“I love the Star-Spangled Banner so much because I love America,” Suraci said.","It was just another college football game on Saturday in Hartford, Connecticut, until just before kickoff, an announcement came over the loud speakers that there would be no playing of the national anthem.

Everyone was on the field, the coin toss had just happened, and players had their helmets off, standing at attention, ready for the anthem to be played, Coach Jeff Devanney told Fox News.

But after a few moments of silence, it was announced the PA system failed – and there would be no playing of the Anthem.

Trinity senior fullback Ethan Suraci told Fox News the silence “felt like forever, honestly. You could hear the crowd and the opposing team” expressing disappointment over the announcement.

Suraci said he immediately started belting out the words to what he calls “America’s song,” which also happens to be his favorite song, and it seemed everyone joined in.

""There were almost three different waves of the Star-Spangled Banner going,” Coach Devanney said. Trinity’s team, Hamilton’s team, and the crowd each had started singing “almost like an echo,” but he added, “It all seemed to end on the same note.”

“That was awesome!” said sportscaster Jake Donnelly, who captured the video and posted it on YouTube. “Not many tenors on either end of the field here this afternoon, but a bunch of players that absolutely love America and love the National Anthem. That was one of the coolest things I have ever seen,” Donnelly added.

“It was a fantastic display of unity and patriotism and gave everyone in the crowd, the teams, and hopefully those who watch the video; chills of hope for a better United States of America and happiness to see us as a society beginning to heal - despite the polarization we see among the citizens and our politicians,” Suraci said.

The incident came a day before Vice President Mike Pence’s decision to leave Sunday’s NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers, when several 49er players kneeled during the Anthem.

Coach Devanney said he discussed the NFL protests with his team, calling it a “complicated issue.”

President Trump tweeted Wednesday it’s “about time” NFL’s Goodell called on players to stand for the national anthem.

The senior political science major, who identifies as a Republican and voted for Trump, agrees.

“I am in total agreement with one's constitutional right to protest. However, these players are protesting in an incorrect forum,” he said. “Why insult an entire country and all those who fell for her?”

The 5-foot-10-inch, 225-pound fullback always stands and proudly holds his hand over his heart, just as he did on Saturday.

No one really knows who first started singing the anthem in at the Jessee/Miller Field, but Coach Devanney told Fox News, “I wouldn’t be shocked if Ethan was the first one, given his love of the song.”

In fact, Suraci listens to the “Star-Spangled Banner” as sung by Celine Dion every day after he’s done with school.

Three songs into his show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the singer launched into a five-minute speech that honored the 58 killed and nearly 500 hurt in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. But Aldean took a defiant tone in telling concertgoers to resist living in fear, and he called for more of the national unity he's seen since the attack.

""These people are going to continue to try to hold us down,"" Aldean said. ""To those people that keep trying to do that, I say (expletive) you, we don't really care.""

Fans agreed. They pumped their fists and held up American flags as Aldean continued.

""I want to play the show for you guys that the people in Las Vegas came to see and didn't get a chance to,"" he said.

Friends Audra Miller, Lee Holstein and Amanda Zmak were some of those fans. They were in the audience when the shooting happened and ran for cover like thousands of others.

They traveled from Dallas for the Tulsa show and wore T-shirts they decorated themselves that said ""Vegas Strong,"" a popular meme since the attack.

Miller, 34, said Aldean made them proud and viewed the evening as a triumph.

""It was therapeutic and kind of like a cleansing all at the same time,"" she said. ""We just wanted to represent family, friends, love and hope.""

Aldean gave fans the show they wanted. The Georgia native is one of country music's biggest stars, touring in support of his album ""They Don't Know,"" which debuted atop the Billboard 200 in 2016. Much of his catalog includes Southern rock, pop and hip-hop influences, a mix of hard-charging party anthems and ballads with lyrics about farm work, drinking and small-town life.

He blasted through hits including ""Big Green Tractor,"" ''Fly Over States"" and ""She's Country,"" and popped open a can of beer onstage after the encore.

Aldean canceled shows in California last week to mourn those killed Oct. 1 at the outdoor Route 91 festival. He resumed his tour in an arena where concertgoers walked through metal detectors, and police presence was visible.

The singer visited shooting victims still in a Las Vegas hospital Sunday. The day before, Aldean performed Tom Petty's ""I Won't Back Down"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" in tribute to the victims and the late rock superstar.

Petty died the day after the shooting in Los Angeles after suffering cardiac arrest.

The tech company recently tested a feature that showed users how many calories they would burn walking from point A to point B, along with a note that equated those calories to mini cupcakes. For example, as Buzzfeed pointed out in one example, a four and a half mile walk would burn around 406 calories: “that’s almost 4 mini cupcakes,” the app reads, alongside a pink cupcake graphic.

The feature also included additional info about how those numbers were calculated. “The average person burns 90 Calories by walking 1 mile. To help put that into perspective, we’ve estimated how many desserts your walk would burn. One mini cupcake is around 110 Calories.”

Google began testing this feature with some iPhone users about a week ago, but not everyone was happy with it. While some welcomed it as motivation to walk rather than take a car or public transit, others accused it of being potentially harmful to those with an eating disorder, pointing out that an obsession with calorie-counting can be a warning sign. There was also no opt-out option available, forcing anyone who used the app to see the built-in feature.

""This is reinforcing behaviors that we’re trying to stop when we're treating a patient for an eating disorder,"" Michelle Lupkin, Ph.D., clinical director of the Eating Disorders Program at Montefiore Medical Center, tells SELF. And, according to Jennifer J. Thomas, Ph.D., codirector of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, using exercise as a way to compensate for calories consumed is a hallmark of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, SELF reports.

In addition to the potentially harmful side effects of the feature, as the Washington Post points out, Google’s measurements of both calories burned and calories per cupcake were questionable. People burn calories at differing rates depending on a number of factors, such as weight and speed at which they’re walking, as Harvard Medical School notes.

“She really didn’t think she had that.
""She didn’t think she had a future with Frank.
She didn’t think they had a stable enough environment to have a family.
It was a big tragedy for both of them.”According to Tina, Gardner later wondered what the couple could have done differently.","When Ava Gardner first met Frank Sinatra in 1943, the duo couldn’t have suspected that six years later, after the actress faced two disastrous divorces before the age of 25, they would happily dive into a controversial love affair.

Anthony Uzarowski and Kendra Bean, who chronicled the Academy Award-nominated star’s life and career in a coffee table book titled “Ava: A Life in Movies,” weren’t completely shocked by how quickly the romance formed between the two stars.

“I think she was really determined to find someone who would give her the kind of security and the kind of happiness that her parents had known,” Uzarowski told Fox News about the North Carolina-born Gardner’s quest for love. “She always wanted that. And I think she found that in Frank.”

However, there was one complication: Sinatra was still married to his longtime sweetheart Nancy Barbato. But that didn’t stop Gardner or Sinatra from seeing each other. Uzarowski claimed Gardner’s well publicized beauty proved too irresistible for the blue-eyed crooner.

“He… had already been married to Nancy for many years and I think he was just really getting tired of that,” he explained. “He didn’t really want that anymore. He wanted to break away… So I think they were both ready for each other… they just really plunged, immersed themselves into this affair… not really caring what anyone thought… They just wanted to be with each other.”

Sinatra may have still been married, but an insistent Gardner reportedly made the singer ask Nancy for a divorce. The mother of his three young children initially refused, but she eventually granted Sinatra a divorce in 1951. One week after his divorce was final, Sinatra married Gardner.

“I don’t think [Frank] wanted to hurt Nancy,” said Uzarowski. “But at the same time, I don’t think he went out of his way to hide [the affair]. They did get into quite a lot of trouble with the public. There were angry letters, hate mail coming in every week to the studio.

""Frank’s records were being burned. There was a huge backlash… it didn’t hurt Ava’s career too badly. Because she had this image of a man-eating femme fatale in movies. Her films actually became more successful. It did certainly hurt Frank’s reputation. His records weren’t selling at all. He was really hitting rock bottom.”

A post shared by Ava Lavinia Gardner (@avagardnerdaily) on Jun 25, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT

Despite the scandal, which reportedly even brought the condemnation of the Roman Catholic Church, Gardner managed to captivate another Sinatra: youngest daughter Tina. Uzarowski and Bean had a two-hour conversation with the now 69-year-old about the bond she developed with her stepmother.

“She really liked Ava,” said Uzarowski. “She could have had a very bad attitude towards Ava because she basically stole her father away from her mother. She could have been resentful. But there was none of that… Tina and Nancy were both very friendly with Ava.”

There’s one memory that Tina can still vividly recall.

“The first time she met Ava, when she was a little girl of 4 or 5, Ava got down on her knees so she [could] have eye contact with her,” said Uzarowski. “And she really treated her with a lot of attention and a lot of warmth. That obviously really impressed her as a child. She still remembered that after all of these years.”

Still, Gardner and Sinatra wouldn’t share a happily ever after. Their marriage was plagued by jealousy, fiery tempers and insecurity. They also publicly battled. The relationship was reportedly so tumultuous that Gardner had two abortions during their marriage, which she later publicly admitted.

“She always believed, and this is something she [later] wrote in her autobiography, that in order to have a family, she would have to make sure she had a very secure home and a secure marriage,” explained Uzarowski. “She really didn’t think she had that. So in her mind, bringing a child into the world would be unfair.

""She didn’t think she had a future with Frank. She didn’t think they had a stable enough environment to have a family. So as far as we know, that’s why she did it… It was certainly a great tragedy to both of them. When Frank found out, he was broken hearted. And I think later on, Ava probably regretted it as well. It was a big tragedy for both of them.”

According to Tina, Gardner later wondered what the couple could have done differently.

The marriage lasted for less than two years. In 1953, MGM announced their separation. Then in 1957, Gardner and Sinatra were divorced. However, they apparently never got over each other. There were even rumors of a possible reconciliation.

Gardner would move on and live a quiet life in London for more than 30 years, seeking salvation from the paparazzi. She never remarried.

One of Sinatra’s biggest tragedies would come in 1990 when Gardner died at age 67 of pneumonia.

“[Tina] said it was such a huge blow to him,” said Uzarowski. “She said he never got over it… It was such a huge shock to him. She was the love of his life, by all accounts. When she did pass away, he was devastated.

A post shared by Ava Lavinia Gardner (@avagardnerdaily) on Mar 18, 2017 at 2:47pm PDT

""Tina said the actual pain he experienced was so much more. He wouldn’t share that with anyone because it was too personal… There was a story that Nancy said in another book that he just locked himself in a room for 24 hours… and wouldn’t speak to anyone.”

Tina also revealed Gardner would always hold a special place in Sinatra’s heart.

“Ava gave Frank this medallion, a charm he wore for the rest of his life,” said Uzarowski. “It was Saint Francis. Because Ava always called him Francis. It was a tiny picture of Saint Francis on one side and another of Ava on the other side. He always kept that.”

Goodell earlier met with the players and spent time “talking about the issues player are trying to bring attention to.” Why?
Goodell shouldn’t care what the reason is for the insult.","It was a swing and a miss. No, that’s the wrong metaphor. It was a fumble. Trying to deal with the controversy over players taking a knee during the national anthem, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell failed to put the issue to rest.

Goodell explained in a recent press conference that the League believes “everyone should stand for the national anthem. It's an important part of our policy and the game. It’s important to honor our flag and our country and I think our fans expect that.”

But apparently he doesn’t believe it’s so important to honor our country that he’d actually require players to stand at attention. He thinks it would be great if they did, but hey, it’s their call.

Many fans seem to be deserting the NFL over the issue, with attendance and TV viewership down, so Goodell had to say something, and perhaps thought he could split the difference. But it’s hard to believe this will satisfy anyone.

The NFL tells its players (tells, not suggests) that excessive celebration after a play will be penalized. Yet deeply insulting behavior to the fans during the ceremony that starts the game is acceptable.

Let’s be clear — this is not a First Amendment issue. It’s not about the government telling the players what to do. It’s about their employers setting basic rules of conduct.

The NFL, for instance, tells its players (tells, not suggests) that excessive celebration after a play will be penalized. Yet deeply insulting behavior to the fans during the ceremony that starts the game is acceptable.

This is also not treating the players unfairly. This sort of thing applies to all jobs. If you work for, say, Federal Express, or McDonalds, while you wear their uniform, you’re expected to handle yourself a certain way. If someone orders a Big Mac and you start haranguing the customer with your views on abortion, the manager will tell you to stop it if you want to keep your job.

And this is not about whatever issues the players believe they’re commenting on. Entirely irrelevant.

Goodell earlier met with the players and spent time “talking about the issues player are trying to bring attention to.” Why? The players are free to hold whatever political opinions they wish, as is Goodell, and they can spend all the time and money they want fighting for their beliefs in their spare time.

But what they shouldn’t be doing is intentionally offending the fans — even for a good cause — or lecturing them, or waving fingers at them, when their job is to put on a good game.

Goodell shouldn’t care what the reason is for the insult. Whether it’s to protest police brutality or to protest taking down Robert E. Lee statues, it shouldn’t be the NFL’s policy to allow its players to be hurtful and rude to the people who ultimately pay their salaries.

Goodell stated “What we’re trying to do is stay out of politics.” Even if true (and how can it be when Goodell himself has said he’s committed to working with the players on social issues?), it’s a little late for that.

But the NFL has made its decision. Now it’s time for the fans to make theirs.",NFL Commissioner Goodell fumbles on flag policy,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/19/nfl-commissioner-goodell-fumbles-on-flag-policy.html

“He ... bullied his way into my hotel room, saying, ‘I’m not going to [have sex with] you, I just want to talk,’” the woman told the outlet. “Once inside, he asked me questions about myself, but soon became very aggressive and demanding and kept asking to see me naked. He grabbed me by the hair and forced me to do something I did not want to do. He then dragged me to the bathroom and forcibly raped me.”

She says that she begged the now 65-year-old Weinstein to stop and showed him pictures of her children during the alleged 45-minute ordeal.

This particular investigation could be problematic for Weinstein, who is currently at a rehab center in Arizona, as it falls within the 10-year statute of limitations for sex crimes in Los Angeles.

Following bombshell exposés from The New York Times and The New Yorker, many women have been coming forward to share their stories of sexual assault or harassment involving Weinstein.

“I was with my son Kamren and this cow ran out of Prospect Park and ran over a baby girl,” said Alexis Small, who was in the park when the unusual incident happened. “The mom was just crying and trying to calm her down. She was in such pain, I couldn’t even imagine.”

Police officers scrambled to capture the bull as it continued to run into a car before dashing into the Parade Grounds.

The event even sparked a social media debate on whether the animal was a cow or a bull.

“Hey, has anyone seen a cow?” NYC Parks tweeted.

“Anatomy is incorrect for a cow, that, my friends is a bull. Udders=cow, penis=bull. Collectively=cattle,” one user replied.

Officers tranquilized and wrangled the bull around 1:30 p.m. after it appeared to trap itself between two fences. Officials loaded it into an NYPD truck.

The bull is headed to Skylands Animal Sanctuary and Rescue in Wantage, N.J., where workers have already named the animal ""Shankar,"" according to WABC-TV.

Torrey Twane McNabb, 40, has challenged the humaneness of the state's lethal injection procedure. He was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection at 6 p.m. CDT, but the Supreme Court granted a stay after McNabb's attorneys filed a flurry of appeals. The justices could still decide Thursday night to go ahead with the execution.

McNabb was convicted in the 1997 shooting death of Montgomery police Officer Anderson Gordon. Prosecutors say McNabb was fleeing a bail bondsman when he walked up and shot Gordon five times while the officer was sitting in his parked patrol car.

McNabb and several other inmates have challenged the state's use of midazolam at the start of lethal injections, arguing that it violates Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment because the sedative would not reliably render them unconscious before other drugs stopped their lungs and heart.

A lawyer for McNabb has argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabb's lawsuit.

Back in 1925, the American Legion erected a memorial in Bladensburg, Md., to honor the memory of 49 men who perished during World War I.

The 40-foot tall memorial became known as the ""Peace Cross.""

In 2014, the American Humanist Association -- a group that believes in ""being good without a god"" -- filed a lawsuit alleging the cross-shaped memorial is unconstitutional and demanding it be demolished, altered, or removed.

They alleged the cross carries ""an inherently religious message and creates the unmistakable appearance of honoring only Christian servicemen.""

On Wednesday, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and ruled the historic memorial must be torn down -- all because the Bladensburg Memorial is in the shape of a cross.

The Fourth Circuit said the memorial excessively entangles the government in religion because the cross is the “core symbol of Christianity” and “breaches” the wall separating church and state.

Writing separately, Chief Judge Gregory wrote, “This Memorial stands in witness to the VALOR, ENDURANCE, COURAGE, and DEVOTION of the forty-nine residents of Prince George’s County, Maryland ‘who lost their lives in the Great War for the liberty of the world.’ I cannot agree that a monument so conceived and dedicated and that bears such witness violates the letter or spirit of the very Constitution these heroes died to defend.”

45th President of the United States Donald Trump joined the Brian Kilmeade Show today to discuss his tax reform plan as well as healthcare, the Iran deal, NFL and more. Listen to the full interview below:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRIAN KILMEADE: So, I know this is a big week. How important is getting this budget passed? To even get to the tax reform conversation, Mr. President?

PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, it's very important. I mean we need the budget, we need the passage. We have Thad Cochran, as you know, is not feeling so great. He may not be able to vote. We don't know what John McCain's going to do. We have a couple of others that maybe could disappoint us, but maybe they won't.

They've been talking about all sorts of things for so long, now they have a President who's really willing to sign what we have to sign. But I think we're going to be good, and I think we're going to be good for taxes. And it's very close, because we have no support from the democrats. They're obstructionists, all they want to do is obstruct. So we have 48 votes against us. So we literally can't lose more than two votes, which is a pretty tough situation.

KILMEADE: On tax reform or the budget -- on the budget in particular right?

TRUMP: On the budget. Well we have phase one and phase two. Phase one, we have to think only - I'm only right now thinking about the budget.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: Phase two is tax, because that will next week. But phase one is the budget. And if we get the budget, I think we'll be in good shape to get the tax, but we have to get the budget.

KILMEADE: I talked to Senator Joe Manchin yesterday who really seems to enjoy your interactions. And he says if they could give me a little something, I could deliver six to eight democrats. Number one, do you believe that? And number two, are you willing to negotiate?

TRUMP: Well we'll be talking to Joe. I think it's hard for Joe to vote against tax cuts. We're talking about massive tax cuts --

KILMEADE: In West Virginia?

TRUMP: In West Virginia. And I've turned West Virginia around, because what I've done environmentally with coal. And I don't know if you saw, but West Virginia is second to Texas in percentage increase of GDP. And everyone's saying ""I can't believe it,"" because they were having such problems. But, I think it's very hard for Joe, I think it's very hard for other people to vote especially where I'm very popular in their states, and they're coming up for election to vote against the largest tax cut in the history of our country. People need their money, where the government is taking too much money. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We need the tax cuts.

KILMEADE: So what Mick Mulvaney brought up to me this morning on television was no one talks about the zero percent, because they have up to $24,000, you're not going to pay any tax, that's part of tax reform -

TRUMP: Right.

KILMEADE: Also, people are focused on the corporate rate deduction, what about the small business?

TRUMP: So small business is coming way down. And if you talk about the zero, I said ""You've got to put the zero in,"" they were saying ""We have three brackets."" I said ""I know you like to say we only have three brackets as opposed to seven or eight, but you've got to put the zero in."" So I said ""Make it four."" And the democrats, Schumer and all, were using that - and they were using it as bait. Now they can't use it anymore, because where they're paying a much higher rate - paying a very high rate, right now a lot of people are going to pay zero.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: Then we go to a 12 percent, as an example, it comes down from 15 - but it really comes down from much higher than that. So it's a great tax cut for the middle class, but - hey look, even the middle class will say it's an unbelievable tax cut for business, which is going to employ people. And the biggest beneficiary will be the middle class.

KILMEADE: So you golfed with Rand Paul over the weekend, and I think most agree, including Mark Short (ph) this morning, said that he's going to be the greatest challenge, because he does not like to vote for budgets or tax reform. I mean, can you be friends -

TRUMP: I think he's definitely with us.

KILMEADE: -- can you be friendly with someone that's going to vote against that? Have you talked to him?

TRUMP: I've had a great relationship with Rand Paul, and I think he's going to be with us. I think in the end he's going to be with us. I hope John McCain's going to be with us, we just don't know yet. We have a couple of votes, and of course that is in a position where it may be impossible for him to be here, which is a big - that's like a no vote. That's almost the equivalent to a no vote. And the problem is we have no democrats. We have absolutely no democrat votes, so -

KILMEADE: Have you tried?

TRUMP: Yes, we've tried. They're in a box (ph), they have 48 votes, and all they want to do is obstruct. Now, I think we'll have democrats if we get through the budget - we have to get through the budget first.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: If we get through the budget, we have the taxes. I think we're going to have some democrats, especially in states where I did very well. I mean I had some states where I won be 30 and 40 points.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: And that's a big margin. And I think we could have potentially some democrats in those states, for the massive tax cuts that we're talking about.

KILMEADE: So it's going to be a big week obviously, and there's certain things you zone in on, and every President's got his preference, some (inaudible) foreign policy. I think you love the numbers, the budget, and the economy. But I've got ask you something the big picture -

TRUMP: I think foreign policy for me has been very strong. I think we did the right thing with Iran, and if you notice, Iran was respectful yesterday. They were not jumping up and down, they were respectful of what I did. And they may not agree with it, but they were very respectful. I think that if you look at what I did with the payments going to the insurance companies, not going to poor people, they're going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I bought a list for you...

KILMEADE: You did. For me?

TRUMP: Look at these -- look at these insurance companies. This is since Obamacare started. Anthem, big company, 270 percent increase. 270 percent. And that's since ACA, that's Obamacare. So since Obamacare, Humana, 420 percent increase. Aetna, 470 percent increase. Cigna, 480 percent increase.

KILMEADE: So I looked at those numbers...

TRUMP: Insurance companies are making a fortune.

KILMEADE: So are you saying when you - when they raise premiums, or raise deductibles, they're trying to increase their profits instead of doing an honest job about giving people insurance? Are they being dishonest in going too profit-oriented?

TRUMP: No, they got a great deal with Obamacare. The one beneficiary, the great beneficiaries for Obamacare is not the people. They're getting killed. And look at what's happening to their premiums, look at what's happening to their deductibles, how high their deductibles. But look, these are - these are not made up by me. When you have Cigna, Aetna, Humana, Anthem going up 270, 420, 470 percent, 480 percent, these are insurance companies that went up 480 percent since Obamacare. Is any stock on the stock exchange - has anybody gone up that much?

KILMEADE: You would know better than me.

TRUMP: The reason is - the reason is, it's because Obamacare is a rip-off. It's great for the insurance companies. And find out who gave all that money to the Democrats. Take a look at the insurance companies.

KILMEADE: Right.

TRUMP: So the Democrats don't want to hurt the insurance companies. So the money I took away was taken away by - from the insurance companies. And by the way, since I took it down, you saw what happened to their stocks.

KILMEADE: Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are working on a bipartisan plan. They stopped when it looked as though Lindsey Graham and Cassidy had something going. Is this to force their hand to come up with something?

TRUMP: Well, this helps, because nobody knows (ph)...

KILMEADE: No, not so much this paper, but so much the $7 billion, ""I'm not making that payment."" Does that help...

TRUMP: Yeah, I think it helps. I think it helps to make a deal...

KILMEADE: So you did it to push action?

TRUMP: I think if I did not do that, if I didn't hold it back - and I just said we're not going to make that payment. If I didn't do that, I don't believe the Democrats would have called.

KILMEADE: David Axelrod said last night that you're pulling this back and (inaudible) tearing up the Iran deal is your attempt to obliterate the Obama legacy. Is it?

TRUMP: No, it's just that I disagree with Obama on so many things. I mean, I heard - as an example, let's say, Hilary Clinton said it was OK for the NFL players to kneel during the anthem. Well, I disagree. Maybe that's why she lost, because that's bad. That's real bad. We have to respect our flag, our country, our anthem. Obama, I disagree with what he does. Look, when you look at this - nobody knows this. I just got these numbers. Nobody knows this about the insurance companies. The only beneficiary from Obamacare are the insurance companies. They made a fortune. And that's not - you've never heard that, you've never seen these numbers before.

KILMEADE: I haven't. And that's why you handed it to me ahead of time, gave me a little bit of time to study. So some other news that broke today and you tweeted out, Congressman Marino was pulled back as drug czar. What went into that?

TRUMP: Yeah, well he's a fine man. He was a supporter of mine from Pennsylvania. Great state, I won Pennsylvania. And he's a Congressman from Pennsylvania, very popular. And he told me, look, if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest with insurance companies, essentially - but if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest, he doesn't want anything to do with it. So whether we have insurance companies or drug companies - and there was a couple of articles having to do with him and drug companies. And I will tell you, he felt compelled - he feels very strong about the opioid problem and the drug problem, which is a worldwide problem. It's a problem that we have. And Tom Marino said ""Look, I'll take a pass. I have no choice. I really will take a pass, I want to do it."" And he was very gracious, I have to say that.

KILMEADE: Big exposé on 60 minutes.

TRUMP: He didn't want to have - he didn't want to have even the perception of a conflict of interest with drug companies or, frankly, insurance companies.

KILMEADE: New HHS secretary, I was talking to Kellyanne Conway today. It seems like you're close. Do you want to go over any names?

TRUMP: We are more than close, but I won't be able to tell you the name yet because we have to do a little vetting. But we are more than close and if this person gets approved it will be a fantastic, a fantastic nomination.

KILMEADE: You came out with Mitch McConnell yesterday and seemed on the same page and then said I'll take any questions. And, it was just a regular - it was like a press conference you'd see on a sporting event.

TRUMP: I only did that because you weren't in the audience.

KILMEADE: I know. Why is that?

TRUMP: If you were in the audience I wouldn't have done that.

KILMEADE: One of the questions was about writing the Green Berets soldiers and ends up being a bigger story. Can I ask you what you thought about when you brought up past presidents and what they've done? Do you want to clarify anything?

TRUMP: Well, there's nothing to clarify because if you look at my whole (ph) this was again fake news CNN. I mean, they're just a bunch of fakers. So, they asked me that questions and for the most part to the best of my knowledge I think I've called every family of somebody that's died and it's the hardest call to make. And I said it very loud and clear yesterday. The hardest thing for me to do is do that. Now, as far as other representatives, I don't know. I mean, you could ask General Kelly did he get a call from Obama. You could ask other people, I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters and I also call.

Now, sometimes if you had a tragic event with - it's very difficult to be able to do that. But I have called, I believe everybody but certainly I'll use the word virtually everybody where during the last nine months something's happened to us all. I've called virtually everybody. I've gone to Dover. I've seen what takes place at Dover.

It's an incredible scene and very, very sad. One of the saddest things you'll ever see. But I really speak for myself. I'm not speaking for other people. I don't know what Bush did, I don't know what Obama did. You could find out easily what President Obama did. All you have to do is ask the military people but I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy.

I can tell you my policy is I've called every one of them. And, you have to let a little time go by. You can't just call immediately but I will be calling, have called and will be calling the parents and the loved ones, wives, et cetera of the soldiers that recently were killed.

MISSOURI COPS POST ‘PUMPKIN LINEUP’ TO SQUASH GOURD THEFT

The Cronies owners say it’s not part of any Halloween stunt, and claim to be just as confused as their patrons.

“For this to happen it’s pretty creepy,” Cronies co-owner, Dave Foldes, told CBS2.

Foldes said he started Cronies nearly three decades ago as a place for friends to gather and hang out.

“It’s just really weird. We’ve been here 27 years nothing weird like this has ever happened,” Foldes said.

Customers don’t seem to be frightened by the potential haunting, instead calling the event “funny” and “interesting.”

“I’m okay until it’s my chair that moves,” a customer told CBS2.

Another customer, Juan Munoz said, “So many people come here and go, so…maybe it’s haunted.”

“We have a lot of good spirits here, I like to think,” Foldes said, referring to the photos that cover the walls of restaurant customers and employees who have passed on.

Though, Foldes does have a scapegoat – or scapeghost – two men who used to frequent the bar often.

“Ralph and Don. They were our first originals. They actually introduced me to my wife. And they died 25 years ago,” Foldes says. “Whenever something funny happens, we blame it on them.”

Every day, Wayne Winters puts on a sandwich board advertisement and walks for miles near his Farr West, Utah home.

“I don’t walk real fast,” he told Fox 13 Now.

Winters said he came up with the idea after his wife, Deanne, was diagnosed with stage 5 kidney failure and he was at a loss of how to help.

“I didn’t know what to do,” he told the news outlet. “I felt like I needed to do something.”

He saw a similar story on the news about a man in search of an organ donor for his wife, and made his own sign before heading out. Nothing that rush hour is his favorite time to walk, Winters said that on his first day, a driver stopped to tell him he would get tested to see if he was a match.

“I say ‘Deanne, I think we have a good chance of getting you a kidney,’” he told Fox 13 Now.

But until it’s confirmed, Winters said he’ll keep walking with his sign. One side of his board brings attention to his wife’s case, but the reverse side notes the thousands of others who could benefit from organ donation.

“After I get a kidney I will have my wife back the way she was, normal, helping people, loving people,” Winters told Fox 13 Now. “She likes to serve other people.”

He said that even after Deanne finds a match, he plans to continue helping others search for their donor.

The ad features two figures, one heavier and another with a much slimmer silhouette, complete with an arrow pointing from the heavier one to the slimmer one. Next to the images is a bold yellow “CAUTION: Skinnypigs will make you look better naked.”

On Twitter, people took issue with both the message and the location.

Heather Peacock tweeted, ""What element of totally inappropriate shall we say about this SkinnypigsUK?? Put up outside a school?! Come on!!""

Sarah Davy wrote, ""That's so shocking in so many ways. Negative body image, inappropriate location & a truly awful company name.""

Still another Twitter user accused Skinnypigs of ""purporting outdated and dangerous gender stereotypes.”

Skinnypigs owner, Jonathan Hair, was not on board with the attacks his business was receiving, and went on the defensive, resulting in a heated back-and-forth on the social media site.

Hair tweeted from the Skinnypigs handle, “You don't even realise that modern feminism is so polluted with self loathing, man hating looms. We have equality now, it's a good thing. While we are giving advice, stop being a feminazi, you are in the wrong side of history. You'll see when you're all growed up.""

Hair even directly attacked one of his critics, saying, ""Thanks for the input, you'd look far less stupid if you looked into what Skinnypigs is and has achieved if you did a little research.""

In another he added: ""Oooo a feminazi eh, I should have known with the glasses.""

He told another critic: ""Just another whiny feminazi who will end up bitter and alone with house full of cats (but thinks she can change the world by complaining).""

His responses fueled his opponents’ fire, and many launched more attacks about the perceived fat-shaming sign, and vowed to no longer give business to Skinnypigs.

The Twitter storm swelled to include Skinnypigs die-hards, who came to their favorite fitness center's aid by sharing their own weight-loss success stories.

One Twitter user said, ""Getting ready for Skinnypigs, a place [where] we support, encourage and empower each other.""

Hair spoke to Mirror Online and defended his responses, saying he had “nothing to be sorry for.”

""It is open season on me at the moment,"" he said. ""To be honest I wish I just ignored it.

""I'm quite worried, I employ 50 people, 48 are women, they are ringing me crying thinking they might not have jobs,” he said. ""The people attacking us have no empathy. They don't realize there are real world repercussions, this is people's livelihood.""

He continued, saying, ""All the hate I was getting, people calling me sexist.

And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Hamlin speaking with Sirius XM NASCAR Radio there, calling for more revenue from NASCAR's TV deal to be shared with teams.

This as NASCAR unveiled rule changes for 2018 to cars that will see the addition of radiators and common flat splitters for all races, and efforts to increase down-force and horsepower for competitors.
