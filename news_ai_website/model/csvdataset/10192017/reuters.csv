LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of messaging app Snapchat, is down more than 10 percent from its IPO price in March.",SoftBank's big checks are stalling tech IPOs,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wsjd-conference-softbank-group/softbanks-big-checks-are-stalling-tech-ipos-idUKKBN1CO3BX?il=0

Police have broken up a series of protests in recent days against a bill to let the 73-year-old president stand again in 2021 elections - the constitution currently sets an age limit for candidates at 75.

Rights organizations and activists have criticized moves by several other long-serving African rulers, notably in Rwanda, Burundi and Burkina Faso, to stay in power by extending term limits.

In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 a.m. deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence.

The war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest, cut growth prospects for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and rattled the euro.

“If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,” Puigdemont said.

Catalonia, which has a distinctive culture and language, triggered Spain’s biggest political crisis for decades with a secession bid it put to a referendum on Oct 1. Only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede, while opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The European Union declined to help mediate, saying the crisis was for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

“Member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation,” European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference during an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly. Some pro-independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the Catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character.

Rajoy plans to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 constitution, which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law.

A senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on Saturday and probably voted through the upper house Senate on Oct. 30, giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before Madrid takes control.

The regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally, call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate, or back down, although this is seen as highly unlikely.

“From the moment the measures are known, the regional government knows what’s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon,” the source said.

Spanish stocks, bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade, but recovered, a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that Madrid had the upper hand in the standoff.

LAW UNCLEAR

The terms of Article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region.

“The government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order, recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating,” government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said in a statement.

Rajoy’s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps. A spokesman for the Socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist Article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way.

Madrid’s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers, to a softer and more targeted approach, the government source said. Theoretically, the central administration could take control of the region’s finances and police, and call a snap election.

But some members of the Catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution, suggesting the stand-off could extend for at least several more days.

Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP party whose 10 deputies are vital to Puigdemont’s coalition, said dialogue with the Spanish state now looked impossible, and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence.

“From our point of view, the sooner this happens the better,” Riera told Reuters in the Catalan capital Barcelona.

Impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city. Merche, 55, who voted for secession in the referendum, said she was tired of the political to-and-fro.

“People want a resolution. Go for one thing or the other, but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work,” she said, rearranging lettuces on her market stall.

Puigdemont has already defied Rajoy once this week, when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks.

Rajoy says the Catalan government has repeatedly broken the law, including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, only to suspend it seconds later.

Barring a surprise and despite May’s plea over a summit dinner in Brussels late on Thursday, the EU will reject British demands for an immediate opening of post-Brexit trade negotiations on Friday and setting a target of December for London to improve its offer on a divorce settlement.

But the leaders of the other 27 members will make a gesture toward accelerating the process by launching their own preparations for a transition period that May has asked for after Brexit to try to ease concerns among businesses.

In some telling choreography that contrasted with images of May standing isolated in Brussels at previous summits, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were caught by the television cameras engaging the British premier in an animated conversation.

In remarks delivered at the end of a dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May sought to calm fears that Britain will use its departure in March 2019 to undercut the bloc’s economy by lowering standards and taxes.

Instead, she asked them to respond in kind to her efforts to break the Brexit stalemate, making clear she was disappointed at their plan to announce on Friday that talks have not yet made enough progress to move on to discussion of future trade ties.

May underlined the “difficult political background” she faces if she returns home empty-handed and said she had realised at the end of the summer what difficulties the talks were in.

“I took stock, listened to what the people in the UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forward,” she was quoted as saying by a British official, referring to a speech she made on Sept. 22.

She asked leaders to say, when delivering their verdict on talks so far, that “the clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward together”.

What they will say, assuming no last-minute changes to a text agreed by their ministers, is that they “welcome” advances made on some issues but that they were not enough.

WEAKENED

Weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority in a June election and by failing to rally support at an ill-fated party conference, May needs to keep the talks on the road to silence the voices calling for her to walk away from the negotiations.

The talks have stalled largely over how much money Britain owes when it leaves the bloc, with EU leaders urging May on Thursday to give more detail on how she will settle the bill.

May instead proposed more moves to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain - one of three issues the bloc says must be settled before moving to discuss a future trading relationship.

After May leaves the summit on Friday morning, the other 27 leaders are due to call on their staff to prepare for talks on the transition period.

That may be enough for May to stave off an attempt by several Brexit campaigners for her to walk away. May’s government has ruled out ending the talks, but the prime minister made clear to EU leaders that she “is working against a difficult political backdrop”, the government official said.

The official suggested she could not move beyond her offer on the financial settlement that she made in the Florence speech, but said she had referred then to several commitments.

“There is increasingly a sense that we must work together to get to an outcome we can stand behind and defend to our people,” she told the leaders, according to the official.

She spoke of a “framework that allows for a close economic partnership that sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance supporting prosperity for all our peoples”.

Talk of a shift in rights and obligations would please EU leaders, who have criticised Britain for trying to “have its cake and eat it”, retaining access to EU markets without having to follow its rules. They say that Britain will have fewer rights once it shakes off many of its obligations to the EU.

“We should be optimistic and ambitious about what we can achieve,” May said, “As we share the same set of fundamental beliefs in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights and high regulatory standards.”

If the United States re-imposes its own sanctions on Iran, it will inevitably avail itself of these UN sanctions, as well.

The Bush and Obama administrations persuaded Russia, China, and the UN Security Council to sanction Iran’s economy in order to limit its nuclear program. The JCPOA traded these sanctions for tight nuclear restrictions and inspections, but the United States and its partners worried that the Security Council might fail to re-impose the sanctions if Iran cheated, reducing Iran’s incentive for long-term compliance. A clever procedural solution was built into the JCPOA. Any participant in the deal can demand that the Security Council vote on a resolution to continue sanctions relief. The U.S. can veto that resolution, so even if the Security Council votes 14-1 all of the previous restrictions on Iran still snap back into place.

The JCPOA was built to respond to Iranian violations, even if Russia and China were no longer aligned with the United States and the EU. It was not designed to withstand a hawkish or isolationist America using its veto power outside of the terms of the deal or against the objections of its European partners.

Ironically, though, if the U.S. does choose to act alone, in the absence of Iranian violations and against the wishes of its allies, it might undermine the substantive goal of UN snapback, leaving empty sanctions on paper.

Once the UN applies – or in this case, re-applies – sanctions, the European Commission and European Union member countries are supposed to take a number of steps to make the UN sanctions part of EU law and regulation. This is serious business for Europe, which is strongly committed to the idea that, as a matter of international law, the UN can impose binding requirements on all members in the interest of international peace and security. The EU has occasionally faced legal challenges in applying UN sanctions, but it never has simply chosen to ignore a binding Security Council resolution as a matter of policy.

Europe would be sorely tempted to do exactly that on Iran. The snap back mechanism is designed for cases of Iranian non-compliance. Under the JCPOA, Washington does not need to prove that Iran has violated the deal, but Europe may decide that American bad faith justifies breaking from its own UN obligations. Certainly, Europe will categorically disagree with the U.S. policy. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, echoing the senior leadership of the UK, France, and Germany, said after Trump’s UN speech that the deal is working and must be preserved. If the U.S. withdraws, the EU has made clear it will do everything within its power to keep the agreement alive by sustaining newly established business ties with Iran.

Europe would thus be faced with a choice between a crime under international law and what it considers to be a policy mistake. In either case, Europe would be justifiably furious about being forced to choose between two important, deeply held policies – adherence to Security Council resolutions and implementation of the JCPOA.

Other countries, including Russia and China, may also prove lax in applying the restored sanctions, but this is both less uncommon and less important to Iran’s economic aspirations. U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA will hurt Iran’s economy badly, but will not achieve the kind of strangulating effect the broad international coalition had before the deal. A deep break between the United States, the UN and Europe will make it much less likely that the U.S. will ever be able to muster such powerful international economic pressure again.

At the UN last week, President Trump called the Iran deal “an embarrassment to the United States.” He teased that he has made a decision about whether to certify Iranian compliance to Congress but refused to tell anyone, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May, what he had decided. The weeks leading to the October 15 certification deadline may be Europe’s last, best chance to explain to President Trump and his advisors that undermining, let alone abrogating, the JCPOA would be a catastrophe not only for the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but also for the bond between the United States and Europe. The only winners would be Europe’s and America’s adversaries.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran threats risk a U.S. break with Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blanc-iran-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-threats-risk-a-u-s-break-with-europe-idUSKCN1C32E3

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, urged voters in New Jersey to reject the “politics of division” by supporting Democrats in next month’s state elections.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama said New Jersey could send a powerful signal about the type of politics it wants by voting for Democrat Phil Murphy in the Nov. 7 governor race.

“You’re going to send a message to the country and send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division, we are rejecting a politics of fear, that we are embracing a politics that says everybody counts,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark that chanted: “Four more years.”

It was the first of two public appearances by Obama on Thursday on behalf of Democratic candidates for governor. He will appear later in Richmond, Virginia. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding elections for governor this year.

Those contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can turn the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The two governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could be a preview of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Obama made his comments just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took a thinly veiled swipe at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade. [L2N1MU1XD]

Trump’s combative style and inflammatory comments have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

But in New Jersey, Obama focused on urging supporters to turn out their friends and families to vote. Democrats hope Obama can help bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

‘CAN‘T TAKE ELECTION FOR GRANTED’

Opinion polls show Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the New Jersey lieutenant governor, who is hindered by the unpopularity in the state of Trump and Republican Governor Chris Christie.

But Obama said no one should assume a victory is in the cards, making an indirect reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

“You can’t take this election or any election for granted. I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said.

Obama will appear on Thursday night in the political battleground of Virginia, which is viewed as a potential bellwether. Opinion polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta snubbed a crisis meeting called by the top election official for Thursday, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning for next week’s presidential vote re-run.

The first presidential vote in August, which Kenyatta won by 1.4 million votes, was annulled by the Supreme Court over procedural irregularities.

The re-run is set for Oct. 26 but opposition leader Raila Odinga has pulled out, alleging a failure to improve oversight of the election, casting doubt on how the vote will proceed.

Election board chairman Wafula Chebukati, in a stark message to political leaders on Wednesday, said he could not guarantee a credible vote under present conditions, and demanded Kenyatta and Odinga meet him for talks.

The board, known as the IEBC, set the meeting for 1130 GMT in Nairobi but then said it had been postponed to an unspecified date and time. Chebukati later tweeted that he had met Odinga and was “looking forward” to meeting Kenyatta, though it was not clear if the president intended to respond to his call.

Opposition demonstrations, which have led to confrontations between police and protesters, and divisive rhetoric by politicians have stoked uncertainty in Kenya, East Africa’s largest economy and a stable Western ally in a chaotic region.

Speaking at a campaign rally in the western town of Saboti late on Wednesday, Kenyatta said the priority was for Kenyans to go to the polls on the set date.

“We are not interested in telling the IEBC what to do. We want them to prepare so Kenyans can vote on the 26th,” he said.

However, Odinga, whose call for mass protests on election day has sparked fears that the crisis could turn violent, called for serious talks on the impasse after meeting Chebukati.

STALEMATE

Odinga said his withdrawal should force the commission to start a fresh 90-day electoral cycle, including fresh candidate nominations. The election board says the vote will go ahead.

Chebukati’s call for a meeting with the candidates followed the flight of one IEBC commissioner to New York. Roselyn Akombe said she had fled due to threats and said the planned election would amount to a mockery of democracy.

The ruling Jubilee party filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Thursday alleging opposition politicians were in contempt of court for obstructing a re-run by withdrawing from the race and by ordering supporters to continue protests including during trainings of election staff in western Kenya.

“The current political climate indeed strikingly resembles the period prior to 2007-2008 post-election violence,” said Francis Ole Kaparo, chair of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, a government body in charge of preventing hate speech. Following the disputed 2007 poll, more than 1,200 Kenyans were killed.","Kenya president snubs vote crisis meeting, presses on with campaign",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CO0ZM-OZATP

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s economics ministry said it is “deeply concerned” about the antitrust agency imposing a $775 million fine on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), in a rare public display of disagreement between authorities.

Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) fined Qualcomm last week, saying the U.S. chipmaker had abused its monopolistic position by opting against licensing some modem-related technologies to other industry players.

Qualcomm said it disagreed and would take the matter to court once the agency releases a final report in coming weeks.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees industrial policy, said it respected the agency’s position but was concerned about any impact on foreign investment.

“With regards to the investigation and judgment process... our ministry is deeply concerned,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday.

“Considering economic stability and prosperity, as well as that the economics ministry is the government authority overseeing industry, the ministry would like to see better coordination between industrial development and fair trading.”

The ministry said the agency did not appear to take into account Qualcomm’s contribution to the overall local technology industry or impact on future business opportunities, describing the U.S. firm as an “indispensable partner”.

The FTC did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) supported the FTC’s action in a statement on Oct. 12, reiterating views of some industry players that it would lead to a fairer business environment for technological innovation.

The action is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing patents related to installation and use.

Con la invocación de una medida nunca usada, el Ejecutivo central dijo que pretende “recuperar la convivencia pacífica y frenar el deterioro económico” en una región cuyas autoridades insisten en seguir por la senda independentista tras el referéndum del 1 de octubre.

“El Gobierno de España continuará con los trámites previstos en el artículo 155 de la Constitución para restaurar la legalidad en el autogobierno de Cataluña”, dijo el Ejecutivo central en un comunicado.

El anuncio se produjo minutos después de que el presidente catalán, Carles Puigdemont, amenazase con votar en el Parlament la declaración formal de secesión, respondiendo implícitamente al requerimiento de Rajoy de que aclarase si la semana pasada lo había hecho.

“Si el Gobierno del Estado persiste en impedir el diálogo y continuar con la represión, el Parlament de Cataluña podrá proceder, si lo estima oportuno, a votar la declaración formal de independencia que no votó el 10 de octubre”, dijo Carles Puigdemont en una carta a Rajoy a diez minutos de cumplirse el plazo dado por Madrid.

El presidente catalán anunció de forma confusa la semana pasada que iba a aplicar medidas para declarar la independencia aunque segundos después las suspendió para abrir un diálogo.

El Gobierno central le reclamó entonces que aclarase por escrito si se había declarado la independencia o no, emplazándole a retractarse en caso de respuesta positiva y bajo la amenaza de medidas extraordinarias si no respondía o no daba marcha atrás.

“Pese a todos estos esfuerzos y nuestra voluntad de diálogo, que la única respuesta sea la suspensión de la autonomía, indica que no es consciente del problema y que no se quiere hablar”, dijo Puigdemont, adelantándose a la respuesta del Gobierno.

En el Parlamento catalán, los anticapitalistas de la CUP, que podrían hacer caer al Gobierno regional si retiran su apoyo, siguieron presionando a la coalición JxS para hacer efectiva la independencia en un pleno en los próximos días.

“Nuestra posición es que tiene que ser lo más pronto posible (..) un escenario de dialogo con el Estado español es imposible”, dijo a Reuters Carles Riera, diputado de la CUP, que no dudó de que la ciudadanía saldrá a la calle a defender sus instituciones en caso de que se invoque el 155.

¿DUI Y ELECCIONES?

Teniendo en cuenta que la aplicación de ese artículo puede tomar varios días, una de las hipótesis sería que el Parlament declarase la independencia y acto seguido se convocaran elecciones “constituyentes”, adelantándose así a las medidas de Rajoy.

El Gobierno catalán buscaría así repetir la jugada de 2015, cuando celebró unos comicios regionales que defendió como “plebiscitarios” pese a que el Ejecutivo central y la oposición en bloque rechazaron este carácter.

El conflicto podría entrar entonces en una nueva fase de confusión ya que la convocatoria de elecciones anticipadas es una de las demandas del Gobierno central para no aplicar las medidas extraordinarias, aunque el supuesto carácter constituyente de la llamada a las urnas complicaría el debate.

“Desde el momento en que se conozcan las medidas, el Gobierno regional sabe lo que va a ocurrir y tiene un período de tiempo para actuar hasta que entre en vigor el 155”, dijo una fuente gubernamental que apuntó a que Puigdemont tendría aproximadamente una semana para decidir qué hacer.

Pese a que las autoridades catalanas han tratado de implicar a la Unión Europea en la crisis, el presidente del Parlamento Europeo, Antonio Tajani, volvió a insistir el jueves en que se trataba de un asunto interno y pidió a Puigdemont que no declarara la independencia de forma unilateral.

El Gobierno en minoría del Partido Popular cuenta en este conflicto con el apoyo del principal partido de la oposición, el PSOE, y de la cuarta fuerza en el Congreso, Ciudadanos. Juntos suman 254 diputados, más del 70 por ciento de la Cámara Baja.

El PSOE pidió el jueves que las medidas, que deberán ser refrendadas en un Senado en el que el PP tiene mayoría absoluta, tengan una duración “limitada y breve”.

INCERTIDUMBRE ECONÓMICA

Los acontecimientos suponen una nueva vuelta de tuerca a una batalla institucional y dialéctica que se libra no solo en el ámbito político, sino también en los tribunales, los medios y la calle, y que está ya teniendo efectos económicos.

La bolsa, que ha sufrido en las últimas semanas los efectos de la incertidumbre asociada al proceso, reaccionó con caídas al nuevo desencuentro.

El Gobierno tuvo que revisar esta semana tres décimas a la baja su previsión de crecimiento económico para 2018 mientras que la autoridad fiscal independiente dijo que un efecto prolongado del problema podría restar hasta 1,2 puntos - más de 12.000 millones de euros- al PIB de 2018.

Entretanto, los temores relacionados con una hipotética inseguridad jurídica han llevado a 800 empresas - incluyendo algunas de las más emblemáticas de la región - a trasladar sus sedes sociales fuera de Cataluña.

“Lo que hemos visto de cambio del domicilio social de 800 empresas es solamente un aperitivo de lo que podría ocurrir si la independencia se llegara a concretar, cosa que este Gobierno no va a dejar”, dijo el ministro de Economía, Luis de Guindos, el jueves en el Congreso.",España inicia el sábado los trámites para intervenir en Cataluña,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idESKBN1CO0XN-OESTP

TORONTO (Reuters) - Black people in Canada’s most populous province spent longer behind bars awaiting trial than white people charged with many of the same categories of crimes in each of the past five years, according to data obtained by Reuters.

Between April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.

The data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)

Among the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.

In three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.

The data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.

Reuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.

A spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.

More than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.

Unlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.

A surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.

Current and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.

HARDER ON THE POOR

Critics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.

“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”

The data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.

Reuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.

Studies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.

This makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.

In a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.

The court did not address race in its ruling.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The founder of Canada’s comedy festival ‘Just for Laughs’, which draws celebrities including Trevor Noah, Sarah Silverman and Jerry Seinfeld, has resigned from his own company in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment.

Gilbert Rozon made the announcement on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. He is the latest entertainment executive to be accused of sexual harassment in the wake of accusations against U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“Shaken by the allegations against me, I wish to take time to reflect,” Rozon wrote, adding he was “sincerely sorry” for “all the women and men I may have offended in the course of my life.”

The company confirmed Rozon’s resignation and said an independent board of directors will be put in place. Spokesman Jean-David Pelletier declined to comment further.

Montreal newspaper ‘Le Devoir’ on Thursday reported allegations by nine women who said they had been sexually harassed or abused by Rozon.

Rozon announced his immediate resignation from ‘Just for Laughs’, as well as his departure from the committee organizing events to mark Montreal’s 375th anniversary this year and his role as vice president of the Montreal Board of Trade.

Held every summer in Montreal, ‘Just for Laughs’ is one of the largest international comedy festivals and is a major tourist attraction for the city.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made gender equality a significant part of the government’s focus, said society was “seeing a moment of awakening”.

“It’s unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets and I think people are beginning to get it,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal. “It doesn’t matter how much power you have, how much influence you have, it’s never all right.”

Amazon Studios chief Roy Price also resigned earlier this week following allegations he harassed a producer and took no action when an actress told him she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein.",Founder of Canadian 'Just for Laughs' comedy festival quits amid abuse allegations,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CO2XN-OCADN

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly 340,000 Rohingya children are living in squalid conditions in Bangladesh camps where they lack enough food, clean water and health care, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday.

Up to 12,000 more children join them every week, fleeing violence or hunger in Myanmar, often still traumatised by atrocities they witnessed, it said in a report “Outcast and Desperate”.

In all, almost 600,000 Rohingya refugees have left northern Rakhine state since Aug. 25 when the U.N. says the Myanmar army began a campaign of “ethnic cleansing” following insurgent attacks.

“This isn’t going to be a short-term, it isn’t going to end anytime soon,” Simon Ingram, the report’s author and a UNICEF official, told a news briefing.

“So it is absolutely critical that the borders remain open and that protection for children is given and equally that children born in Bangladesh have their birth registered.”

Most Rohingya are stateless in Myanmar and many fled without papers, he said, adding of the newborns in Bangladesh: “Without an identity they have no chance of ever assimilating into any society effectively.”

Safe drinking water and toilets are in “desperately short supply” in the chaotic, teeming camps and settlements, Ingram said after spending two weeks in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

“In a sense it’s no surprise that they must truly see this place as a hell on earth,” he said.

One in five Rohingya children under the age of five is estimated to be acutely malnourished, requiring medical attention, he said.

“There is a very, very severe risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases, diarrhoea and quite conceivably cholera in the longer-term,” he added.

UNICEF is providing clean water and toilets, and has helped vaccinate children against measles and cholera, which can be deadly, he said.

The agency is seeking $76 million under a $434 million U.N. appeal for Rohingya refugees for six months, but is only 7 percent funded, he said, speaking ahead of a pledging conference in Geneva on Monday.

U.N. agencies are still demanding access to northern Rakhine, where an unknown number of Rohingya remain despite U.N. reports that many villages and food stocks have been burned.

“We repeat the call for the need for protection of all children in Rakhine state, this is an absolute fundamental requirement. The atrocities against children and civilians must end,” Ingram said.

Researchers last year detected 3 tonnes of silver and 43 kg of gold in effluent and sludge from waste water treatment plants - amounting to around 3 million Swiss francs ($3.1 million).

But before people start hunting in their drains for jewelry, the government study said the tiny particles were likely to be mostly from the watchmaking, pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, which use the metals in their products and processes.

“You hear stories about an angry man or woman throwing jewelry down the toilet, but we didn’t find any rings, unfortunately,” report author Bas Vriens said on Thursday.

“The levels of gold or silver were very small, in the micrograms, or even nanograms, but when you add them up it’s pretty substantial.”

Researchers are now studying if it is worthwhile to extract the metals that end up in sewage sludge before usually being burnt, but so far it has not found to be cost effective.

Higher levels of gold were found in the western Swiss region of Jura, believed to be linked to watchmakers that use the precious metal to decorate their expensive timepieces.

There was also a higher concentration in the southern canton of Ticino due to the gold refineries in the area. This was the only region where it might make sense to recover the metals, Vriens said.

Other trace elements including rare metals such as gadolinium - used in medical imaging - were also found by the scientists from the government’s institute of aquatic science and technology (EAWAG).

Their discovery is the latest example of wealthy Switzerland finding riches in unusual places.

Last month an investigation was launched after toilets at a Geneva bank and three restaurants were blocked by about $100,000 in high-denomination banknotes - a bit different from the huge fat mass that blocked an east London sewer.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The number of asylum seekers walking across the U.S. border into Canada illegally dropped by more than two-thirds in September from August, government data showed on Monday, as officials seek to dispel myths around the country’s refugee system.

The decline, to 1,881 from 5,712, brings the total number of border-crossers so far this year to 15,102 - the vast majority entering the primarily French-speaking province of Quebec. The influx prompted the creation of a temporary tent encampment in Quebec and sparked a backlash from anti-migrant groups.

September’s drop comes after a push by Canada’s federal government to correct “misinformation” in diaspora communities in the United States that Canada gives all refugee applicants permanent resident status.

Canada received almost 36,000 refugee claims in the first nine months of the year, putting the country on track to have more claims this year than any since 2001.

Preliminary numbers indicate many asylum seekers are succeeding in their refugee claims, which means they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home countries.

Lawyers who have handled dozens of cases told Reuters that decision-makers, previously skeptical of claims from people who spent time in the United States, have been sympathetic toward clients who say they left fearing President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Acceptance rates in the first half of this year were in keeping with previous years’.

Of the 300 asylum seekers processed since Sept. 5 by the Immigration and Refugee Board’s dedicated team in Quebec, between 165 and 177 have been accepted, according to spokeswoman Anna Pape.

That success rate is higher than previous years’ averages for Haitians, who make up the majority of asylum seekers who crossed into Quebec illegally this summer.

”A lot of assumptions have been made about the refugee claimants arriving in recent months,“ said Canadian Council for Refugees Executive Director Janet Dench. ”We are not surprised to find that a significant proportion are found to be refugees.”

The number of refugee hearings delayed due to lack of people to hear the case or places to hold the hearing rose tenfold within a year, according to refugee board statistics.

It will take an estimated 16 months for claims now in the queue to be decided, Pape said – leaving asylum seekers in limbo as they try to establish lives in Canada.

Bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on Thursday in a New York speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of President Donald Trump.

Bush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow Republican’s nine-month White House tenure. He did not mention Trump by name.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” Bush said at the Bush Institute’s National Forum on Freedom, Free Markets and Security.

Trump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “Crooked Hillary” for Democrat Hillary Clinton and, more recently, “Liddle” Bob Corker for a Republican senator who dared to challenge him.

Bush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that Trump has cracked down on while in office.

“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said.

“We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.”

Asked whether the speech was aimed at Trump, a spokesman for Bush said the long-planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years.

“The themes President Bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said Bush spokesman Freddy Ford.

Bush touted U.S. alliances abroad, something Trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused Trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year.

CRITICIZES RUSSIA

In the speech, Bush described a decline in public confidence in U.S. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs.

“Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said. “We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”

Trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that Democratic former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Obama, Trump’s predecessor, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii.

Bush said Americans were the heirs of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

“This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American,” he said. “It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”

Trump has had a rocky relationship with the Bush family. He belittled former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was an early opponent of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, and has criticized George W. Bush for the war in Iraq and for presiding over the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Bush said globalization could not be wished away “any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

He also had harsh words for Russia and seemed to take aim at Trump for playing down Moscow’s intervention in the U.S. election.

“According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy,” he said.

“Foreign aggressions, including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence, should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home.”","Bush takes veiled swipe at Trump, defends immigration and trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bush/bush-takes-veiled-swipe-at-trump-defends-immigration-and-trade-idUSKBN1CO2VG?il=0

Barring a surprise and despite May’s plea over a summit dinner in Brussels late on Thursday, the EU will reject British demands for an immediate opening of post-Brexit trade negotiations on Friday and setting a target of December for London to improve its offer on a divorce settlement.

But the leaders of the other 27 members will make a gesture toward accelerating the process by launching their own preparations for a transition period that May has asked for after Brexit to try to ease concerns among businesses.

In some telling choreography that contrasted with images of May standing isolated in Brussels at previous summits, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were caught by the television cameras engaging the British premier in an animated conversation.

In remarks delivered at the end of a dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May sought to calm fears that Britain will use its departure in March 2019 to undercut the bloc’s economy by lowering standards and taxes.

Instead, she asked them to respond in kind to her efforts to break the Brexit stalemate, making clear she was disappointed at their plan to announce on Friday that talks have not yet made enough progress to move on to discussion of future trade ties.

May underlined the “difficult political background” she faces if she returns home empty-handed and said she had realised at the end of the summer what difficulties the talks were in.

“I took stock, listened to what the people in the UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forward,” she was quoted as saying by a British official, referring to a speech she made on Sept. 22.

She asked leaders to say, when delivering their verdict on talks so far, that “the clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward together”.

What they will say, assuming no last-minute changes to a text agreed by their ministers, is that they “welcome” advances made on some issues but that they were not enough.

WEAKENED

Weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority in a June election and by failing to rally support at an ill-fated party conference, May needs to keep the talks on the road to silence the voices calling for her to walk away from the negotiations.

The talks have stalled largely over how much money Britain owes when it leaves the bloc, with EU leaders urging May on Thursday to give more detail on how she will settle the bill.

May instead proposed more moves to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain - one of three issues the bloc says must be settled before moving to discuss a future trading relationship.

After May leaves the summit on Friday morning, the other 27 leaders are due to call on their staff to prepare for talks on the transition period.

That may be enough for May to stave off an attempt by several Brexit campaigners for her to walk away. May’s government has ruled out ending the talks, but the prime minister made clear to EU leaders that she “is working against a difficult political backdrop”, the government official said.

The official suggested she could not move beyond her offer on the financial settlement that she made in the Florence speech, but said she had referred then to several commitments.

“There is increasingly a sense that we must work together to get to an outcome we can stand behind and defend to our people,” she told the leaders, according to the official.

She spoke of a “framework that allows for a close economic partnership that sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance supporting prosperity for all our peoples”.

Talk of a shift in rights and obligations would please EU leaders, who have criticised Britain for trying to “have its cake and eat it”, retaining access to EU markets without having to follow its rules. They say that Britain will have fewer rights once it shakes off many of its obligations to the EU.

“We should be optimistic and ambitious about what we can achieve,” May said, “As we share the same set of fundamental beliefs in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights and high regulatory standards.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to its lowest level in more than 44-1/2 years last week, pointing to a rebound in job growth after a hurricane-related decline in employment in September.

The labor market outlook was also bolstered by another report on Thursday showing a measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region racing to a record high in October. The signs of labor market strength could cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

“It doesn’t take one hundred PhD economists at the Fed to figure out that the labor market is on the tight side of normal,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. “At this point, we would expect a sharp bounce-back in employment growth in October.”

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said. But the decrease in claims, which was the largest since April, was probably exaggerated by the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.

Claims are declining as the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma washes out of the data. The hurricanes, which lashed Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, boosted claims to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September.

A Labor Department official said claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico continued to be impacted by Irma and Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure. As a result the Labor Department was estimating claims for the islands.

Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey left more than 100,000 restaurant workers temporarily unemployed. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are not included in nonfarm payrolls.

Economists had forecast claims slipping to 240,000 in the latest week. The dollar briefly pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors booked profits after a recent rally that lifted shares to record highs. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Last week marked the 137th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

Improvements in the labor market have been largely due to a recovery that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term. While U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax plans, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies.

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Tightening labor market conditions likely keep the Fed on track to raise interest in December for a third time this year, even as inflation remains moderate.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,500 to 248,250 last week.

The claims data covered the survey week for October nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 20,500 between the September and October survey periods, supporting views of a rebound in job growth this month.

“The data suggest that the underlying trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining,” said Jim O‘Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region soared 24 points to a record high reading of 30.6 in October.

The average workweek index also increased 8 points to a reading of 19.4. It said no firms reported decreases in employment this month. The robust labor market readings helped to lift the Philadelphia Fed’s current manufacturing activity index four points to a five-month high of 27.9 in October, offsetting declines in new orders and shipments measures.

Also underscoring labor market strength, the claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 16,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since December 1973.

The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims fell 22,750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.",U.S. jobless claims hit 44-1/2-year low; mid-Atlantic factories humming,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment/u-s-jobless-claims-hit-44-1-2-year-low-mid-atlantic-factories-humming-idUSKBN1CO1RU

In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time.

The war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest, cut growth prospects for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and rattled the euro.

“If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,” Puigdemont said.

Only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede, while opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The European Union declined to help mediate, saying the crisis was for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

“Member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation,” European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference during an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly. Some pro-independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the Catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character.

Rajoy plans to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 constitution, which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law.

A senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on Saturday and probably voted through the upper house Senate on Oct. 30, giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before Madrid takes control.

The regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally, call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate, or back down, although this is seen as highly unlikely.

“From the moment the measures are known, the regional government knows what’s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon,” the source said.

Spanish stocks, bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade, but recovered, a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that Madrid had the upper hand in the standoff.

LAW UNCLEAR

The terms of Article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region.

“The government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order, recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating,” government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said in a statement.

Rajoy’s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps. A spokesman for the Socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist Article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way.

Madrid’s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers, to a softer and more targeted approach, the government source said. Theoretically, the central administration could take control of the region’s finances and police, and call a snap election.

But some members of the Catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution, suggesting the stand-off could extend for at least several more days.

Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP party whose 10 deputies are vital to Puigdemont’s coalition, said dialogue with the Spanish state now looked impossible, and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence.

“From our point of view, the sooner this happens the better,” Riera told Reuters in the Catalan capital Barcelona.

Impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city. Merche, 55, who voted for secession in the referendum, said she was tired of the political to-and-fro.

“People want a resolution. Go for one thing or the other, but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work,” she said, rearranging lettuces on her market stall.

Puigdemont has already defied Rajoy once this week, when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks.

Rajoy says the Catalan government has repeatedly broken the law, including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, only to suspend it seconds later.

Bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on Thursday in a New York speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of President Donald Trump.

Bush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow Republican’s nine-month White House tenure. He did not mention Trump by name.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” Bush said at the Bush Institute’s National Forum on Freedom, Free Markets and Security.

Trump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “Crooked Hillary” for Democrat Hillary Clinton and, more recently, “Liddle” Bob Corker for a Republican senator who dared to challenge him.

Bush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that Trump has cracked down on while in office.

“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said.

“We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.”

Asked whether the speech was aimed at Trump, a spokesman for Bush said the long-planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years.

“The themes President Bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said Bush spokesman Freddy Ford.

Bush touted U.S. alliances abroad, something Trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused Trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year.

CRITICIZES RUSSIA

In the speech, Bush described a decline in public confidence in U.S. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs.

“Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said. “We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”

Trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that Democratic former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Obama, Trump’s predecessor, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii.

Bush said Americans were the heirs of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

“This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American,” he said. “It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”

Trump has had a rocky relationship with the Bush family. He belittled former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was an early opponent of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, and has criticized George W. Bush for the war in Iraq and for presiding over the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Bush said globalization could not be wished away “any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

He also had harsh words for Russia and seemed to take aim at Trump for playing down Moscow’s intervention in the U.S. election.

“According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy,” he said.

“Foreign aggressions, including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence, should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home.”","Bush takes veiled swipe at Trump, defends immigration and trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bush/bush-takes-veiled-swipe-at-trump-defends-immigration-and-trade-idUSKBN1CO2VG

South Africa were given a glimpse of what they have been missing as De Villiers flayed Bangladesh’s attack with stunning ease on his way to a career-best one-day international score on Wednesday.

He smashed 176 from 104 balls, including seven towering sixes, as South Africa sealed the three-match series with a game to spare following a 104-run victory.

“I‘m hitting the ball as well as ever and it felt that way out there, I could feel the ball coming off really well,” he told reporters. “It’s just nice to contribute.”

De Villiers had been on a self-imposed exile from the side, but announced last month he would be available again in all three formats as South Africa prepare to welcome India and Australia for respective test series in the coming months.

“I just needed a couple of months away with the family, which I got,” he said.

”I watched all the games the guys played and I’ve been in contact with them. It felt like I never really left, but I did miss being on the park and playing.

“It’s great to be back. It’s a huge privilege to play for my team and my country. For the last few months, I’ve been working really hard on my game and all I wanted to do was get back into the side.”

De Villiers hinted in the past that he may retire from test cricket to concentrate on the limited-overs game, but appears to have performed an about-turn and is now hopeful of a return to the longest format for the first time since January 2016.

”If selected, I will be there but I can’t accept that I am going to be in the squad,“ he said. ”I have been out of the squad for a while and guys that have come in have done well.

“You don’t just walk into the test team. I am going to have to work my way back. I am prepared to do the hard work.”

(Reuters) - A Native American tribe sued Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in federal court in Virginia on Wednesday for infringing supercomputer patents it is holding for a technology firm.

The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe was assigned the patents by SRC Labs LLC in August, in a deal intended to use the tribe’s sovereign status to shield them from administrative review.

SRC is also a plaintiff in the case.

Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.

The tribe, which would receive a share of any award, made a similar deal in September to hold patents for Allergan on its dry eye medicine Restasis.

SRC and Allergan made the deals to shield their patents from review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative court run by the U.S. patent office that frequently revokes patents. The tribe would get revenue to address environmental damage and rising healthcare costs.

Companies sued for patent infringement in federal court often respond by asking the patent board to invalidate the asserted patents. Both Microsoft and Amazon have used this strategy to prevail in previous disputes.

In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 a.m. deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.",'Anemic' iPhone 8 demand drags Apple shares lower,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CO1E7-OCATC

The move is a shift in strategy for the world’s largest social network, which previously has tried to keep users within its own service, and may help restore its image by strengthening ties to respected news organizations after the spread of false news stories on Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

It may also help soothe relations with some publishers, which often see their articles widely shared among Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly users but have found it hard to translate Facebook readers into paying subscribers.

While publishers will own the data on users who buy a subscription, they will not have information on who reads the free articles on Facebook, a main point of contention for several publishers.

Under the trial, which includes the Boston Globe, Germany’s Bild and France’s Le Parisien, Facebook mobile users can read 10 articles under a publication’s paywall for free, or a selection of articles publishers allow access to, and will then be prompted to purchase a subscription on the publisher’s website for full access.

Facebook will not take a cut of the revenue from any subscriptions purchased, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.

Several major publishers have decided not to take part, largely because Facebook will not give access to reader data until they purchase a subscription.

An executive at Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O), told Reuters Facebook’s one-size-fits-all testing model would be a step back from the Journal’s paywall strategy.

“Ten free articles is quite a lot,” said the executive, who requested anonymity. “It’s more about the data and around remaining in control of our membership strategy.”

Britain’s Financial Times will not participate either, a source familiar with the matter said. The newspaper, which also charges for access to its articles online, wanted a registration process to get hold of reader data in exchange for free articles, said the source.

The New York Times Co (NYT.N) has yet to commit to the trial and is still in discussions with Facebook, a Times spokeswoman said, declining to give further detail.","Facebook to launch news subscription feature, some big names opt out",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-publishing/facebook-to-launch-news-subscription-feature-some-big-names-opt-out-idUSKBN1CO2Y6

Madrid (Reuters) - Nach dem Verstreichen eines zweiten Ultimatums an die katalanischen Separatisten bereitet die Zentralregierung in Madrid die formelle Übernahme der Macht in der Region vor.

Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy berief am Donnerstag sein Kabinett dazu zu einer Sondersitzung am Samstag zusammen. Dabei könnte der Artikel 155 der Verfassung aktiviert werden, mit dem Katalonien die Autonomierechte entzogen und die Region der Zentralverwaltung unterstellt würde. In der EU kann Rajoys Regierung offenbar auf Rückendeckung setzen: Kanzlerin Angela Merkel sagte, sie hoffe auf eine Lösung auf Basis der spanischen Verfassung. Diese spricht wie die Zentralregierung von einer “unauflöslichen Einheit der spanischen Nation”.

Regierungssprecher Inigo Mendez de Vigo kündigte an: “Die Regierung wird alle zur Verfügung stehenden Mittel nutzen, um so schnell wie möglich Gesetze und Verfassungsordnung wiederherzustellen.” Am Donnerstagmorgen war auch ein zweites Ultimatum an die katalanische Regionalregierung abgelaufen, sich klar zur Einheit Spaniens zu bekennen. Kataloniens Regierungschef Carles Puigdemont drohte damit, bei einer Zwangsverwaltung durch Madrid werde die nach seiner Lesart in der vergangenen Woche verkündete, aber noch nicht in Kraft gesetzte Unabhängigkeit ausgerufen. In Spanien wird nun spekuliert, dass das Regionalparlament noch am Wochenende die Unabhängigkeit ausrufen könnte, um der Entmachtung zuvorzukommen. Dann würde das Regionalparlament aufgelöst, und verfassungsgebende Wahlen würden angesetzt.

ARTIKEL 155 SOLL DIE SPANISCHE EINHEIT RETTEN

Erstmals seit der Rückkehr zur Demokratie vor knapp 40 Jahren steht Spanien damit vor einer Zerreißprobe: Bisher wurde der Artikel 155 in der Verfassung von 1978 noch nie angewendet. Er sieht den Entzug von Autonomierechten und die Unterstellung unter die Zentralverwaltung vor, wenn sich eine der 17 Regionen nicht an die Verfassung hält. Vorbild ist der Artikel 37 (“Bundeszwang”) im deutschen Grundgesetz, mit dem der Bund gegenüber den Ländern notfalls ein Weisungsrecht durchsetzen kann. Dem Schritt muss in Deutschland der Bundesrat zustimmen, in Spanien der Senat mit seinen Regionalvertretern. Die oppositionellen Sozialisten sagten der Regierung für ihr Vorgehen Unterstützung zu, regten aber an, dass die Zwangsmaßnahmen zeitlich und inhaltlich begrenzt werden sollten.

Der Streit über die Unabhängigkeit treibt seit Wochen immer wieder Hunderttausende Befürworter und Gegner auf die Straßen. Der Konflikt beunruhigt auch die Wirtschaft: Seit dem umstrittenen Referendum am 1. Oktober haben nach offiziellen Angaben 700 Unternehmen ihren Firmensitze aus Katalonien verlagert.

Sollte Katalonien unter Kuratel gestellt werden, könnte die Zentralregierung dort die Kontrolle über Polizei und Finanzen übernehmen und Neuwahlen ausrufen. Nach dem Referendum hatten Puigdemont und andere katalanische Politiker am 10. Oktober eine Unabhängigkeitserklärung unterzeichnet, diese aber sofort wieder außer Vollzug gesetzt. Puigdemont vermied sowohl in seinem Schreiben am Montag als auch in seinem Brief am Donnerstag eine klare Aussage dazu.

PUIGDEMONT FORDERT GESPRÄCHE MIT MADRID

In seinem zweiten Schreiben an Rajoy machte Puigdemont deutlich, dass er sich nicht beugen will. “Wenn die Regierung weiter den Dialog verhindert und mit der Unterdrückung weitermacht, könnte das katalanische Parlament (...) über eine formelle Unabhängigkeitserklärung abzustimmen.” Wann das geschehen könnte, ließ er offen. Puigdemont steht auch im eigenen Lager unter Druck. Er führt eine aus vier Parteien bestehende Minderheitsregierung an, die auf die Tolerierung durch die CUP angewiesen ist, die auf eine zügige Abspaltung dringt.

Der Präsident des Europaparlaments, Antonio Tajani, rief die Separatisten im Sender Cope auf, auf die Proklamation der Unabhängigkeit zu verzichten. “Niemand in Europa könnte die Unabhängigkeit Kataloniens akzeptieren. Deswegen werden sie alleine stehen. Niemand wird der katalanischen Regierung in dieser Richtung helfen.”",Spanische Regierung bereitet Machtübernahme in Katalonien vor,https://www.reuters.com/article/spanien-katalonien-idDEKBN1CO1JL

(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year.

The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said.

“It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors.

PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results.

Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses.

It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay.

In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions.

“We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said.

The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion.

PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents.

Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space.

Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion.

Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.","PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-hldg-results/paypal-tops-profit-estimates-lifts-target-on-mobile-payments-growth-idUSKBN1CO2ZW

NEW YORK (Reuters) - On the 30th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash, U.S. stocks are at a record high and investors are concerned that steep valuations may mean a correction is overdue, despite healthy corporate earnings and economic growth.

But could a repeat of “Black Monday” happen today? Modern trading technology, changes to the way stock exchanges operate and in the way investor funds are managed should make a repeat of the 1987 crash unlikely. Yet cautious traders refuse to rule it out.

“We have learned a lot from the mistakes of the past in terms of the reaction or over reaction,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O‘Neil Securities in New York.

On Monday Oct. 19, 1987, following large declines on Asian and European markets the previous week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points, or 22.6 percent, for the biggest-ever single day decline in percentage terms by the blue-chip benchmark.

A decline of up to 20 percent in one day is possible today, but it would likely be a more orderly process, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

“We have the ability to shut things down for a period of time and reassess and try to ascertain what is the best way to get back in business and take a calmer look at things,” he said.

In response to the 1987 crash, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandated the creation of market-wide “circuit breakers” that call a temporary halt to trading after the Dow declines 10, 20 and 30 percent. Only one market-wide halt has been triggered since then, in 1997.

The circuit breakers were adjusted in 2012, lowering the thresholds needed to trigger a trading pause, with the Dow replaced by the S&P 500 stock index as the benchmark index.

Under current rules, if the broader S&P 500 index falls more than 7.0 percent before 3:25 p.m. New York time, trading is paused for 15 minutes. If the decline continues once trading resumes, and it is still before 3:25 p.m., the market is again paused at 13 percent. If the decline happens after 3:25 p.m, trading continues. But if the decline reaches 20 percent, trading is suspended for the session, regardless of the time of day.

“The industry has come an awfully long way from ‘87,” said Larry Tabb, who heads capital markets advisory firm TABB Group.

“The regulators have done a good job at implementing rules that help the markets ensure that they stay stable at a time when there is not a reason for them not to be stable.”

Many of the current measures aimed at taming market chaos were implemented after the May 2010 “flash crash,” when the Dow Jones Industrial Average careened nearly 1,000 points, around 9.0 percent, in a matter of minutes before mostly rebounding in a similarly short period.

The SEC approved a regulation in 2012 called “Limit-Up Limit-Down,” which prevents stocks from trading outside of a specific range based on recent prices, pausing trading in the stocks in question when prices run afoul of the bands.

The U.S. regulator and exchanges were forced to readjust the bands again, and the re-opening procedures for paused stocks, after a chaotic trading session in August 2015. Then, concerns over the health of the Chinese economy led to panic-selling and a dearth of buyers, spurring a record intra-day drop in the Dow.

On that day more than 1,250 trading halts in 455 individual stocks and exchange-traded funds spawned confusion that may have compounded the problem and led to some investors getting worse prices than they otherwise would have.

“Anything is possible,” said Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions Inc in New York. “With the advent of computer technology and the speed at which that technology has transformed the market, it is very possible.”

The safeguards in place would likely prevent another 1987- style crash from taking place, but with the Dow hitting a frothy 23,000 points for the first time ever on Wednesday this week and the advent of high-speed automated trading, some traders are not so sure.

“Could it happen, something similar to that?” asked Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. “Yeah. How will it pan out and what will be the outcome? That is why they play the game.”",Analysis: Could the 1987 stock market crash happen again?,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-crash-structure/analysis-could-the-1987-stock-market-crash-happen-again-idINKBN1CO0FH

Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space.

Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion.

Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes.

Investors have been anxious to hear who President Donald Trump will pick as the nominee. A decision like Powell would likely be a continuation of the current stock market-friendly monetary policy that has helped fuel the market’s more than eight-year bull run.

Stocks had been recovering from early losses for much of the afternoon but the S&P 500 and Dow were still a tad lower just before the Powell report.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I can’t observe any other reason for why we ended up.”

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of (current Fed Chair) Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove ... and, with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber-accommodative monetary policy, as more welcome than the alternative,” he said.

Powell was among several names circulating as possible picks, including Yellen. Others include Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

The White House on Wednesday said Trump will announce his decision on the matter in the “coming days.”

Tech shares were among the day’s biggest drags, led by Apple (AAPL.O), which fell 2.4 percent in its biggest daily percentage decline since Aug. 10 as doubts about its double 2017 iPhone release strategy weighed on investors.

Stocks have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

The day also marked the 30th anniversary of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Most traders see a repeat of the crash as unlikely because of modern trading technology and other changes.

Investors also took profits in the broader tech sector, which has had a strong run so far this year, gaining about 30 percent and helping drive the market’s recent record run. The tech index .SPLRCT was down 0.4 percent on the day.

Weighing on the market early as well was some disappointing news on the earnings front.

His latest full-length feature, ""Ajji"" (Grandmother), is the dark tale of an old woman who sets out to avenge the rape of her granddaughter.

Makhija tells Reuters why “Ajji” is about urban privilege and how the making of the film took a toll on his health.

Q: One of the big themes that emerge out of “Ajji” is urban privilege. Why was that important?

A: I don’t know if you have seen my short films, but I do this in all my stories. Not only because I feel guilty being born into a middle-class family and having three meals a day, but because I have actively travelled in tribal areas. When I came to Mumbai, I stayed in a slum for the first two years. I have actively tried to understand inequality, because inequality manifests in injustice. The law, though it says it is equal for all, everyone cannot access it. In all my stories, I try to remind those who have a little privilege that you are having it easy and there is someone out there who is not.

Q: How did you end up living in a slum?

A: I am from Calcutta. I was a journalist for a bit, in advertising for a bit, and I just couldn’t figure out what I wanted to do. I had a few friends who knew videography and they said, “Come here”. I came to Mumbai and lived in a slum rehabilitation colony. I didn’t have a choice – I didn’t have too much money. My mum had just passed and I had walked away from life as I knew it. Living there, I started questioning my life as it had been up until then.

The first film I worked on was ""Black Friday"". Even during the research of that film, we worked in the ghettos like Behrampada, Navpada. We lived in those areas for days and that just set me on a journey I couldn’t turn back from. I have taken it upon myself to put these people in all my stories - to tell stories about them because they are not represented in the mainstream.

I could have made “Ajji” more arthouse than it actually is. But somewhere in its story-telling, I tried to make it accessible. I tried to keep the thrill and drama going because I want the mainstream to watch it so that they will think about the other sections of society.

Q: What have you learned about the “other sections”?

Handout still from the movie ""Ajji""

A: There’s nothing that I learned from them. The more time I spend in strata and milieus that I don’t belong to, the more I learn about us. The fact that we take too much for granted. We feel wronged about being shortchanged while buying a pair of shoes. And over there is a grandmother whose granddaughter had her life taken from her as she knew it. She will never be the same again. That level of shortchange doesn’t compare to this. There is such a dichotomy and we understand life at such a different level... we operate at such a different frequency.

Q: Does it frustrate you as a film-maker that we don’t see too many of these subjects in the mainstream?

A: No, it doesn’t. And I try and not be arrogant about it. This film, even though it was made at a frighteningly low budget of 1.2 crores (12 million rupees), is still one point two crores, the kind of money I will never see at one go in my lifetime. And I am using someone else’s money to make my film. If someone is giving you money, they don’t want you to hold a mirror to them. They want to escape somewhere else. I get that and I have no sour grapes about that.

Q: How did you come up with the character of Ajji, the protagonist in your film?

A: Ajji was a response to a lot of things, (like) the constant reportage of rape after Nirbhaya. After a point, the film goes beyond rape and revenge. It is about all these inequalities. I had an idea about the most unlikely candidate in a family who would go out and do something about this. And the answer was the grandmother. And we made it even harder for her – we gave her arthritis, we made her live in a milieu where the patriarchy is so systemic that you don’t even realise it’s there until something gets out of hand. The truth of rape-revenge is so universal that I knew that if I make it dramatic enough, I’ll have the audience. The question was - how do I throw in all the other things that I wanted to talk about. That is how Ajji emerged.

Q: Your villain is completely despicable. Did he have to be that way for the film to work?

A: That’s a fair question. But like I said, in that milieu, the patriarchy is 5,000 years old. I was trying to distill that thought process into a person. Dhawale is not a person, but a thought process, and because it is so powerful, he had to be that way.

Q: You said that the making of the film affected your health.

A: (Pauses). I finally feel ready to talk about it. All of last year, during the making of the film, I started hating on my own masculinity. I was in prep in September last year when I started urinating blood. I was in severe pain and thought I wouldn’t be able to shoot. A doctor at the Hinduja Hospital thought it was prostate cancer. I shot on medication and as I went into post-production, I started healing myself. I met a few alternate healers who told me that I was hating on my own masculinity and the prostate gland is really the seat of the male hormone.

Demand for gold jumped in India this week on account of Dhanteras and Diwali, but high prices took some sheen off the yellow metal’s lure during the key festival period this year.

Demand in the world’s second largest gold consumer usually strengthens during the final quarter as the country gears up for the wedding season soon after the festivals when buying bullion is considered auspicious.

After poor sales during Dussehra festival, demand improved significantly over the last two weeks, but was still 15 percent lower than last year’s Diwali, said Nitin Khandelwal, chairman of All Indian Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation.

“In some regions, demand was nearly 30 percent lower than normal, but in others, it was at par compared with last year. Overall for the country, demand was down around 15 percent.”

Local gold rates were at a premium of up to $2 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, unchanged from last week.

“Consumers were price sensitive and buying less gold than last year. They had a very tight budget,” said Mangesh Devi, a jeweller in the western state of Maharashtra.

Gold prices in India have risen nearly 8 percent so far in 2017.

“This year, my husband’s business is down due to GST (Goods and Services Tax). That’s why I reduced spending on gold,” said Sangeeta Pardesi, a housewife, who buys gold on Dhanteras every year.

The launch of the GST in July, which transformed India’s 29 states into a single customs union, has hit small and medium size businesses and consumers overall.

Elsewhere in Asia, there was a slight uptick in demand for physical gold, with benchmark spot gold rates headed for a weekly decline after touching a one-week low of $1,276.22 an ounce on Thursday, pressured by a firmer dollar [GOL/].

“There was some buying as prices fell, especially around the $1,280 level,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.

However, investors remained cautious, awaiting direction on economic policy and market reforms during the 19th Communist Party Congress in China which kicked off on Wednesday and were also focused on the upcoming elections in Japan, he added.

In top consumer China, premiums charged ranged between $8 and $12 per ounce over the benchmark this week, compared with $9-$14 a week earlier.

With post-Maria Puerto Rico the latest example of that trope, it’s time for a better understanding of how disaster management works.

A disaster destroys in hours infrastructure that took decades to build. Millions of people lose the services that separate a middle-class suburb from an impoverished slum – clean water, sewers, power, hospitals, roads. And Maria was the strongest storm to strike the area in 80 years.

Meanwhile, the media tends to focus on drama and controversy. They often overplay the story via anecdotal reporting (“Here’s Mrs. Hernandez without electricity,” says the reporter [pause], “with no help in sight”) and underplay the work being done, especially at the beginning of the response where progress is hard to see. First responders on laptops methodically solving supply problems are not very mediagenic, after all.

At the moment of any disaster, needs are at 100 percent while the response is at a zero point. The response starts in deficit. It always looks grim, especially to participants and outside observers unfamiliar with the process. They want what is a marathon to play out like a sprint.

In dealing with a major disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military follow a standard playbook. I know, I worked with both on and off for two decades while with the State Department. I trained with them, and was on the ground for relief efforts after the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (more than 6,000 dead) and 2004 Asian tsunami (280,000 dead.) I worked the Washington DC-end of many other disasters. I read after-action reporting from 20-30 other such events.

The critical initial step is a needs assessment, from which everything else flows. Everyone wants to jump in and do something, but responders need time to visit sites, confer with local officials, and determine what is needed and where the needs are greatest. It is a slow process in a chaotic environment, delayed by weather, roads, and communications. From the outside it can look like nothing is being done; Mrs. Hernandez still doesn’t have electricity even as helicopters are flying around, apparently ignoring her!

The needs assessment gets the right help to the right places in order of priority. As an example, I was part of a liaison team with the American Navy at Phuket, Thailand following the Asian tsunami of 2005. Without any local input, the U.S. first helicopters brought in huge fresh water bladders. It turned out most of the water was unneeded; the city had warehouses full of the bottled version.

It took a day for us to track down, but the most urgent need the Navy could address was a buildup of medical waste at local hospitals. Waste pre-disaster was trucked out daily; the tsunami wrecked the roads, and so boxes of soiled bandages and infected sharps accumulated. When American resources turned to help dispose of that, hospitals were able to run at peak capacity. Lives were saved. The water bladders lay abandoned in parking lots around town.

Other decisions that can flow from a needs assessment might include restoring power to one school to shelter 50 families before fixing 50 individual homes. It can mean blocking people from calling internationally so limited cell capacity can be directed to local emergency calls. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, set as a priority reopening dialysis centers across Puerto Rico. Somebody else didn’t get helped first to make that possible.

At the early-to-intermediate stages of a disaster response people in less affected areas will wait in long lines for supplies. It looks bad on TV, but can actually mean the system is working, as help was directed to a higher priority. It takes good reporting to know if that’s the case. Instead, progress is often too quickly defined as “make everything back to the way it was before the storm.”

The military plays a key role in disaster response. The problem is Americans are conditioned to believe there are unlimited resources of all types, instantly movable across notable distances.

Military units tend to have war fighting as their primary job, and most are somewhere doing that, or training to do that. Shifting to a disaster mission can happen quickly but not instantly. It’s also essential to gather people with the right skills – electrical engineers, teams that desalinate sea water for drinking, and sewage crews (3.4 million people’s waste festering with fecal-borne disease is a dreaded secondary killer in this disaster.)

Much mockery has been directed at Trump’s statement about Puerto Rico being an island, surrounded by “big water.” His phrasing was callous, but the fact Puerto Rico is an island is significant. Unlike Texas or Florida, no one can self-evacuate, by car or even on foot. Same for incoming aid. Everything must travel by plane, or, more likely, ship.

Puerto Ricans now need some two million gallons of fresh water a day. A gallon weighs about eight pounds, so that’s 16 million pounds of water. A C-130 cargo plane can carry some 42,000 pounds. So that’s 380 flights a day, every day, just for water. There are bigger aircraft, but the bottom line is always the same: you simply have to move the epic quantities required to respond to an epic island disaster by ship to a port, then inland by truck.

That last step, moving supplies from a port (or airport) to those who need them is known as the “last mile” problem. It haunts every disaster response.

Success with the last mile depends on local infrastructure. If it was neglected before the disaster, it will never be better (and often worse) during the disaster response. Next comes the need for trucks, fuel for those trucks, drivers, security, and personnel and equipment to offload the ships and load the vehicles. If you’re missing one link in the chain, the aid does not move.

These are tough realities, not excuses for why more hasn’t been done for desperate people. It can be a complex, methodical process, addressing a single problem (get water to that village) as a cascading string of nested problems. While the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s remark that Puerto Rico relief is the “most logistically challenging event” the United States has ever faced seems exaggerated, it does underscore the size of the job at hand.

So don’t be distracted by the apocalyptic tweets between Trump and his critics; they exist independent of the ground truth. Because while no response is ever fast and robust enough, the systemic breakdowns that hit New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have largely been fixed, well-before Trump even took office.

Responses are always imperfect; lack of drinking water remains a critical issue. The loss of life in Puerto Rico is sure to rise from 16, as rescuers reach more remote areas. For Harvey, the death toll was at least 70, Irma 72. Katrina saw 1,836 fatalities with over 700 people still missing.

But a tipping point will take place, where adequate services are restored and people will start to receive the help they need. Problems will reduce from regions without power to villages without power to an isolated home without power. The principles of disaster management should not be lost in the politics surrounding events in Puerto Rico. Everything else right now seems to be just Twitter wars.","Commentary: For hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, an insider’s guide to disaster management",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-disaster-commentary/commentary-for-hurricane-hit-puerto-rico-an-insiders-guide-to-disaster-management-idUSKCN1C805X

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of messaging app Snapchat, is down more than 10 percent from its IPO price in March.",SoftBank's big checks are stalling tech IPOs,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-wsjd-conference-softbank-group/softbanks-big-checks-are-stalling-tech-ipos-idUKKBN1CP001

Many expect that the U.S. president will decertify Iranian compliance with the deal -- returning U.S.-Iran relations to a state of overt hostility.

Not all in the administration seem to agree with Trump’s harder-line approach on Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis has publicly stated that Trump “should consider staying” in the deal, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has reportedly argued against decertification. Speaking after his first meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, Tillerson also seemed to indicate a willingness to take a longer-term view when he told a media conference that the Washington-Tehran relationship had “never had a stable, happy moment in it.” ”Is this going to be the way it is for the rest of our lives and our children’s lives and our grandchildren’s lives,” he asked.



Tillerson’s remarks evoked an encounter told to me by Mohsen Rafiqdoost, a former Iranian Revolutionary Guards Commander, of a 1982 meeting he had with Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Rafiqdoost recalled suggesting that the U.S. embassy grounds in Tehran be converted to a Revolutionary Guards base. Ayatollah Khomeini rejected the idea, asking “Why would you go there? Are we not going to have relations with America for a thousand years?”

It’s clear that decades of estrangement have led to a fundamental misunderstanding of Iran in Washington. Notwithstanding the Obama administration’s nuclear negotiations, every U.S. administration since the 1979 Iranian revolution has failed in its declared objective to contain Iran.

If Trump wishes to free future generations of anxiety over U.S.-Iran tensions, he should pay careful attention to five points in formulating his Iran policy.

Shoppers at the Grand Bazaar in the center of Tehran, Iran, August 2, 2017. Nazanin Tabatabaee Yazdi/TIMA via REUTERS

First, American officials need to stop speaking about Iran in threatening and insulting terms. The Iranian people are proud of their thousands of years of history and above all else view mutual respect as integral to their foreign relations. However, Foreign Minister Zarif told me that Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month was the “most insulting speech of any American president toward Iran since the revolution” and that it “made any potential for dialogue with the United States meaningless.”

Second, U.S. regime-change policies have been self-defeating. The principal reason for lasting Iranian distrust of the United States since the revolution has been U.S. policies aimed at undermining and overturning the Iranian political system. In June, Tillerson openly declared that U.S. policy towards Iran included regime change -- a statement not heard from a senior U.S. official in years and which marked a sharp departure from conventional U.S. rhetoric of seeking Iranian “behavior” change.

In stark contrast, Barack Obama told the UN that “we are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.” Consequently, he was able to diplomatically engage Iran on its nuclear program, and reach the July 2015 nuclear deal. The respectful letters exchanged between Obama and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei helped set the process in motion. This would not happen today even if Trump made a similar overture, as the key to successful negotiations with Iran is to first drop regime-change policies.

Third, since the 1953 U.S.-led coup that overthrew democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, Iranians have resented U.S. interference in Iran. The political landscape of conservatives, moderates, and reformists in Iran is in many ways similar to the competition between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. As such, any agreement between Washington and Tehran must be negotiated in a way that transcends the partisan divide in each country -- or else it would be inherently fragile. The challenges the nuclear deal has been subject to in Washington by the Republican Party is testament to this need. With respect to Iran too, negotiations must be carried out in a way that respects Iran’s political makeup and hierarchies.

Fourth, the Trump administration needs to accept that Iran, as a large country with immense natural resources and an educated population, has legitimate security concerns and interests in its neighborhood. Washington must recognize that U.S. policies aimed at isolating Tehran and refusing to accept a legitimate Iranian role in the region have only seen Iranian influence grow in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon while U.S. influence wanes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. From Iran’s perspective, its post-1979 foreign policy has been driven by the aim of deterring foreign aggression and securing the country’s borders rather than the pursuit of regional hegemony. After the revolution, Iran was invaded by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and, for much of the past decade, chaos on its thousands of miles of borders with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan – all factors that have compelled it to play a regional role. If the United States wants to avoid scenarios where regional states aggressively compete for power it must encourage the creation of a regional security system involving the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Iraq and Iran.

Finally, the record of U.S.-Iran negotiations shows that “dual track” policies of pressure and diplomacy are destined to fail. While Trump appears to be trying to bring Iran to the negotiating table in a position of weakness, Iranian policymakers tend to respond to pressure by retaliating in kind.

In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted how by the time he entered into negotiations with Iran, after years of sanctions, Iran had “mastered the nuclear fuel cycle” and built a uranium stockpile large enough to make 10 to 12 bombs. “In other words, Iran was already a nuclear-threshold state,” wrote Kerry.

The lesson for Washington here is that if push comes to shove, Tehran will develop its own bargaining chips --- not capitulate in the face of whatever threats are made when Trump delivers his next policy speech on Iran.",Commentary: A former Iranian diplomat on what Trump needs to know about Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mousavian-iran-commentary/commentary-a-former-iranian-diplomat-on-what-trump-needs-to-know-about-iran-idUSKBN1CE22K

(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year.

The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said.

“It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors.

PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results.

Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses.

It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay.

In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions.

“We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said.

The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion.

PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents.

Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space.

Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion.

Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.","PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CO2ZW-OCABS

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers voted on Thursday to bring online messaging and email services such as WhatsApp and Skype into the scope of tough telecoms privacy rules that will restrict how they can track users.

The vote in the European Parliament’s civil liberties committee was hailed as a step forward by privacy activists but heavily criticized by industry for being too restrictive and inconsistent with a separate data protection regulation.

Under the reworked “ePrivacy” proposal, telecoms operators and internet players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of the customers’ communications and ask for users’ consent before tracking them online to serve them personalized ads.

The rules aim to provide a level playing field between telecoms firms and online players such as WhatsApp, Google and Skype. Currently only telecoms companies are subject to the ePrivacy law.

MEPs strengthened the privacy protections in the original European Commission proposal by requiring web browsers to have their default settings as not allowing personalized online advertising based on browsing habits. Instead, users will be asked to opt in to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers.

Cookies are placed on web surfers’ computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users.

Websites will also be forbidden from preventing users from accessing their content if they do not consent to being tracked, a measure that was criticized by online advertisers as forcing websites to offer content for free.

“News and other online services rely on data-driven, ad-funded business models to finance the creation of content,” said Townsend Feehan, CEO of IAB Europe, the industry association of online advertisers.

“Content that must be given away for nothing will ultimately end up being worth nothing.”

Thursday’s deal is not final as the Parliament will need to find a compromise with member states, who are still divided on the issue.

Additionally, MEPs from the largest center-right group in the Brussels-based legislature voted against the proposal, saying it was weighted too heavily for privacy, restricting digital innovation.

However, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the vote in the parliamentary committee.

“Consumers should not be forced to give up their privacy when they visit a website, send an email or purchase something online,” said Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC.

“It’s alarming that the online companies who claim to be the trend-setters and the engine of the digital economy cling to an advertising business model based on snooping on people.”","EU lawmakers agree to strengthen privacy rules for WhatsApp, Skype",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-privacy/eu-lawmakers-agree-to-strengthen-privacy-rules-for-whatsapp-skype-idUKKBN1CO2OM

TORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected a bid to revive a defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby by an actress who said the entertainer raped her in 1974 and then called her a liar after she made her accusations public in a newspaper interview.

The lawsuit, filed by Kathrine McKee, revolved around a letter that an attorney for Cosby sent New York’s Daily News in 2014 as a wave of women was coming forward to accuse the comedian of a string of sexual assaults dating back to the 1960s.

The statute of limitations on the alleged crimes had long expired, leading some accusers to pursue civil lawsuits, such as McKee‘s. The lawsuits and accusations by dozens of women shattered the family-friendly reputation Cosby built in a career highlighted by his role in the 1980s television hit “The Cosby Show.”

Cosby, 80, has denied wrongdoing, saying any encounters with his accusers were consensual. He is awaiting an April retrial in Pennsylvania on charges he sexually assaulted a former basketball coach at his alma mater, Temple University.

McKee argued in her suit that the attorney’s letter to the newspaper called her a liar by saying the article was ”defamatory, characterizing her claims as “wild” and suggesting she had a criminal record.

But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston stood by a lower-court ruling that the entertainer could not be sued over the letter.

The decision found that McKee had made herself a public figure by wading into the controversy with Cosby, rejecting her claim that her dispute with the entertainer was a private one. As a public figure, McKee would have to prove that Cosby acted with malice in his response.

“The web of sexual assault allegations implicating Cosby, an internationally renowned comedian commonly referred to as ‘America’s Dad,’ constitutes a public controversy,” U.S. Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch wrote for the three-judge panel.

William Salo, McKee’s attorney, said he disagreed with the decision and may appeal.

“They’re saying just because a famous person rapes you, you become a public figure if you complain about it,” he said.

Alan Greenberg, a lawyer for Cosby, welcomed the ”well-reasoned decision confirming that there was no defamation.”

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Tom Westerman voted for Donald Trump in last year’s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies.

“It really upset me,” said Westerman, 63, a self-described “middle-class guy” with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.

Westerman’s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.

Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.

Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama’s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.

“It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,” said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.

Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter’s college tuition. “He says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?”

A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has called subsidy payments a “gift” for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.

Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.

“I support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,” said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.

“Forget the president – it’s the Congress’s responsibility. They’re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,” Heuring said.

In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.

On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.

Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump’s cutoff is settled in court.

The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.

MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE

If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.

Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.

Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America’s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.

Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump’s decision.

“The first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,” said Feit, a Democrat.

Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.

“It is a concern obviously,” Lewis said.

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

“The cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,” said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

”Hey Amazon, we need to talk,“ ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. ”We’re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Verizon’s perch as the No. 1 carrier in the United States looks secure. The $200 billion telecom firm reported a rise in wireless subscribers on Thursday. But the gap is narrowing. Cable rivals Comcast and Charter are also offering mobile services, AT&T is trying to become a media company and Sprint and T-Mobile may yet merge. A heavy debt load hobbles Verizon’s ability to quickly change lanes.

Verizon said it had a net addition of more than 600,000 wireless customers, including those for tablets and other devices, who pay a monthly bill in the third quarter. Earnings were flat at $3.7 billion, but $10 billion in cost savings targeted by Chief Executive Lowell McAdam over the next four years should help the bottom line.

Looming over Verizon is the chance that Sprint and T-Mobile US may finally combine. The third and fourth carriers in the United States argue that a tie-up would better position them to compete against Verizon and its peer AT&T. Adding to the pressure, both Comcast and Charter Communications are launching their own mobile initiatives. Sure, Comcast is using Verizon’s backbone for cellular but it would be unwise to underestimate the ability of Brian Roberts’ company to turn foe.

The options for Verizon to buy its way out of trouble are limited. Three years ago the telecom firm closed a $130 billion purchase of the remaining 45 percent stake of the venture Verizon Wireless from Vodafone. The amount of debt on the balance sheet - $117 billion as of the end of September – gives it limited flexibility.

There is a possibility of a bid for satellite distributor Dish, which has an enterprise value of about $40 billion, but AT&T sounds a cautious note about how big deals can pan out. The second-largest mobile carrier warned earlier it lost 90,000 U.S. video subscribers in the third quarter because of competition and weather. AT&T bought satellite firm DirecTV in 2015 for $67 billion and is preparing to close on its $109 billion deal for Time Warner.

McAdam may yet choose to copy AT&T’s media strategy and go beyond the $9 billion or so he spent on AOL and Yahoo, though paying a premium may be a stretch. Verizon has boasted of raising its dividend for 11 years in a row.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber rammed a car into a police truck in the southwestern city of Quetta on Wednesday, killing at least seven people, police said.

The attack killed five police officials and two passers-by on the outskirts of the city of Quetta, police chief Abdur Razzaq Cheema said. He said 22 people were wounded, eight of them critically.

Sarfraz Bugti, the home minister of Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is capital, told Reuters: “It was a suicide blast.”

Quetta is about 100 km (60 miles) east of the border with Afghanistan.

Bugti said the truck carrying the police officials was on its way to the city to drop them at their posts when the suicide bomber rammed into the vehicle. Television pictures showed the burnt wreckage of the vehicles.

Baluchistan province has long been the scene of an insurgency by separatists fighting against the state to demand more of a share of the gas- and mineral-rich region’s resources. They also accuse the central government of discrimination.

The Taliban, Sunni Islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State group also operate in the strategically important region, which borders Iran as well as Afghanistan.

The violence has fuelled concern about security for projects in the $57 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan’s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

A suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State at a Sufi Muslim shrine this month killed 22 people and wounded more than 30.

Ayub Qureshi, the provincial police chief, said a counter-terrorism police officer was shot and killed in another part of Quetta as authorities were dealing with the suicide bombing.

A militant sectarian faction, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Almi, claimed responsibility for killing the counter-terrorism official, and for planting a roadside bomb in a northwestern region, that killed two soldiers.

The Department for Transport said 3 million pounds ($3.9 million) would be made available to support innovation in the detection of hidden explosives, as well as new methods to recognise when electrical items had been tampered with.

“We need to embrace and encourage the talent from industry that will allow us to stay several steps ahead of those who wish us harm,” security minister Ben Wallace said in a statement.

The mustachioed hero, who has been entertaining readers with his magic-potion exploits alongside Obelix since 1959, has become a mainstay in the publishing industry, with more than 370 million albums sold worldwide.

As well as being translated into more than 100 languages, the books have inspired a dozen movies and cartoon series, making it a global phenomenon.

The latest edition, ‘Asterix et la Transitalique’ (Asterix and the Chariot Race), is set in ancient Italy.

Rather than a showdown with Julius Caesar, it involves the resolute Gauls meeting a tribe called the Italics who are also fighting to remain independent from Rome.

The original books, written by Rene Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo, built up a mass following in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, with many childhood readers from those days still snapping up the titles decades on.

After Goscinny’s death in 1977, Uderzo wrote and illustrated the series until he retired in 2009. The last three editions have been written by Jean-Yves Ferri and drawn by Didier Conrad, sticking closely to the original format.

“We had Italy in mind and then I had the idea of a chariot race, a sort of rally from ancient times, a trip across the peninsula leading from one city to another,” said Ferri as he and Conrad presented the new edition this week.

According to tradition, the latest Asterix features a new villain, Coronavirus, a mysterious, masked chariot racer who will stop at nothing to win.

While Uderzo plays a role overseeing the series, Ferri said he had not asked for any changes.

”He wanted a team able to perpetuate the tradition and he put his trust in us,“ he said. ”He shows his support, but is not really critical.

“The only change we had to make was putting a dot on the ‘i’ of ‘italique’,” he joked. “We agreed against our will.”

With the Asterix movies proving box office successes, the books have attracted a new, younger generation of followers. That is reflected in the print run for Asterix and the Chariot Race, with five million copies planned.","With the crazy 'Italics', Asterix returns for 37th adventure",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CO10X-OCAEN

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior White House aide said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets.

Marc Short, the White House’s top liaison to Congress, said on CNN that Obamacare’s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal.

“We’re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we’re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,” Short said.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving the subsidies, which Trump has discontinued, for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage.

The bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on Thursday after several Republican senators said they would support the measure. But Short’s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement. Democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of Obamacare.

Short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the bill’s co-authors and would likely make them public.

“The gist is we believe that the individual mandate should (be) repealed, employer mandate repealed and allow Americans to contribute to health savings accounts,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Alexander and Murray said the deal they struck now has the support of 12 of the 52 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate, as well as 12 Democrats.

While Alexander predicted in remarks on the Senate floor that the plan “will become law in some fashion before the end of the year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is against it.

Lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the Senate floor tucked inside a bigger “must-pass” bill that Congress needs to act on in December, such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown.

Trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. But his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra-party divisions.

Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance to 20 million people but Republicans call it government interference in Americans’ healthcare.

The law’s individual mandate requires all Americans to purchase health insurance, while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage.

TRUMP REVERSES POSITION

Trump initially indicated support for the Alexander-Murray agreement but reversed himself, saying on Wednesday “I can never support bailing out” insurers.

Senator Mike Rounds, one of the bill’s Republican co-sponsors, said that if Trump decides he does not support it, “then it will not go forward.” When a reporter noted that Trump does oppose it, Rounds replied, “That was yesterday.”

Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, who focuses on healthcare, said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing, with Trump “flip-flopping every day” and Ryan not supportive of the bill.

Among hospital stocks, Community Health Systems (CYH.N) closed up 3.7 percent, Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) rose 2.9 percent and HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA.N) gained 3 percent. Most insurers rose more modestly.

Without the subsidies, insurance premiums for some of the 10 million Americans who get coverage through Obamacare markets will surge. Noting that some conservative Republicans object to the subsidies, Alexander asked, “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy insurance, or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created?”

The bill has broad support among Democrats, but had just seven Republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier.

Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, who co-authored a bill in September to repeal and replace Obamacare that failed to muster enough support, endorsed the bipartisan effort.

“We believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long-term solution” that would overhaul Obamacare, they said in a joint statement.

If passed in December, as opposed to before the Nov. 1 beginning of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare insurance policies, it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year, meaning its benefits might not be felt until 2019. Insurers have already decided whether to participate in the Obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

The bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

Many Senate Republicans are nervous about the prospect of voting on any healthcare measure - no matter what legislation it may be attached to - that buttresses Obamacare.

Part of the fear, one senior Senate Republican aide said, is that Trump’s former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is recruiting hard-line conservative primary challengers to run against incumbent Republican senators next year. The aide said incumbents do not want to be forced to cast a controversial vote to stabilize Obamacare, a law reviled by many conservatives.

If all 46 Senate Democrats and two independents back the Alexander-Murray bill as expected, the support of the 12 Republicans means the bill has the 60 votes needed to reach the super-majority required to pass most legislation in the Senate.

Trump on Thursday underscored his concerns about the bill. He urged Alexander and Murray to be “careful with respect to the insurance companies,” which he said are “extremely talented at making money.”

Alexander and Murray said their legislation does not bail out insurers. Alexander said House Republicans passed an Obamacare repeal and replace bill in May that also would continue subsidy payments for two years.

Alexander said Trump has called him four times in recent days on this subject, including a Saturday night call when he was at a restaurant and “my dinner got cold.” He urged the president to support the initiative.",White House says rollback of Obamacare must be part of short-term fix,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/white-house-says-rollback-of-obamacare-must-be-part-of-short-term-fix-idUSKBN1CO2N7

Barring a surprise and despite May’s plea over a summit dinner in Brussels late on Thursday, the EU will reject British demands for an immediate opening of post-Brexit trade negotiations on Friday and will instead set a target of December for London to improve its offer on a divorce settlement.

But the leaders will make a gesture towards accelerating the process by launching their own preparations for a transition period that May has asked for and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after the dinner that she had “absolutely no doubts” that Britain and the EU could get a good result on Brexit.

In choreography that contrasted with images of May standing isolated in Brussels at previous summits, Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were filmed by television cameras engaging the British prime minister in an animated conversation.

In remarks delivered at the end of a dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May sought to calm fears that Britain will use its departure in March 2019 to undercut the bloc’s economy by lowering standards and taxes.

Instead, she asked them to respond in kind to her efforts to break the Brexit stalemate, making clear she was disappointed at their plan to announce on Friday that talks have not yet made enough progress to move on to a discussion of future trade ties.

May underlined the “difficult political background” she faces if she returns home empty-handed and said she had realised at the end of the summer what difficulties the talks were in.

“I took stock, listened to what the people in the UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forward,” she was quoted as saying by a British official, referring to a speech she made on Sept. 22.

She asked leaders to say, when delivering their verdict on talks so far, that “the clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward together”.

There was no discussion after she spoke, according to an EU diplomat. Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders, said only that the leaders took note of her comments. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters that she had made no new proposals.

Leaders will say, assuming no last-minute changes to a text agreed by their ministers, that they “welcome” advances made on some issues but that they were not enough.

DIFFICULT POLITICS

Weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority in a June election and by failing to rally support at an ill-fated party conference, May needs to keep the talks on the road to silence the voices calling for her to walk away from the negotiations.

The talks have stalled largely over how much money Britain owes when it leaves the bloc, with EU leaders urging May on Thursday to give more detail on how she will settle the bill.

May instead proposed more moves to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain - one of three issues the bloc says must be settled before moving to discuss a future trading relationship.

After May leaves the summit on Friday morning, the other 27 leaders are due to call on their staff to prepare for talks on the transition period.

That may be enough for May to stave off an attempt by several Brexit campaigners for her to walk away. May’s government has ruled out ending the talks, but the prime minister made clear to EU leaders that she “is working against a difficult political backdrop”, the government official said.

The official suggested she could not move beyond her offer on the financial settlement that she made in the Florence speech, but said she had referred then to several commitments.

“There is increasingly a sense that we must work together to get to an outcome we can stand behind and defend to our people,” she told the leaders, according to the official.

She spoke of a “framework that allows for a close economic partnership that sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance supporting prosperity for all our peoples”.

Talk of a shift in rights and obligations would please EU leaders, who have criticised Britain for trying to “have its cake and eat it”, retaining access to EU markets without having to follow its rules. They say that Britain will have fewer rights once it shakes off many of its obligations to the EU.

“We should be optimistic and ambitious about what we can achieve,” May said. “As we share the same set of fundamental beliefs in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights and high regulatory standards.”

PARIS (Reuters) - Plane giants are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a once raging torrent of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years, as the aerospace industry heads to a belt-tightening Paris Airshow looking for new sources of revenue.

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

(For graphic on China GDP click: here)(For graphic on China economy click: here)","BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s central bank chief on Thursday issued a stark warning about asset bubbles in the world’s second-largest economy, which looks set to clock its first acceleration in annual growth since 2010, driven by public spending and record bank lending.

Speaking on the sidelines of the closely-watched, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan spoke of the risks of a “Minsky moment” in the economy, referring to a sudden collapse in asset prices after long periods of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures.

Zhou’s comments refer to a theory on prices derived by American economist Hyman Minsky and follow official data that showed China’s economic growth slowed in the third quarter from a year earlier, as expected, but remained on track to post the first full-year pickup in seven years.

Coming on the 30th anniversary of the Black Monday Wall Street crash, the comments from the governor, who is likely to retire soon, echo concerns expressed in the past by international economic bodies about relative levels of corporate and household debt in the economy.

But while hedge funds sometimes refer to Minsky in warnings about a China credit bubble threatening the global economy, China has so far proven doomsayers wrong.

“I would doubt they really think China is in for a Minsky Moment, but maybe he is tying to impress (other leaders in Beijing) on the need to start reining in credit growth,” said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.

“It’s not really up to (the central bank)... We would have to look at what the leadership says about these things.”

Recent efforts to curb financial risks and cool the property market are beginning to weigh. While the economy grew a solid 6.8 percent from the previous year in the third quarter as expected, growth in new construction slowed and property sales dropped for the first time in more than two-and-half years in September.

In all, growth was still on track to comfortably beat the government’s target of around 6.5 percent for this year and 2016’s rate of 6.7 percent, which was a 26-year low.

‘URGENT’ REFORM NEEDED

Analysts and global economic bodies such as the International Monetary Fund warn Beijing is stimulating credit too heavily in its aim to meet fixed growth targets. Rating agencies estimate the overall debt burden at almost three times economic output.

Data on Saturday showed Chinese banks extended more loans than expected in September, backed by demand from home buyers and companies.

While household loans accounted for a smaller percentage of total new loans, their value jumped more than 10 percent to 734.9 billion yuan last month from August, according to Reuters calculations.

“China’s high debt burden is an area where reform is most urgently needed but progress has been the slowest,” said Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.

There are, however, signs that policymakers are making needed changes in other parts of the economy.

Beijing’s push to consolidate and restructure its industrial sector has paid dividends as factory output beat expectations, while strong fiscal spending and sustained public investment helped boost domestic demand.

The economy slowed slightly from 6.9 percent in the second quarter, however, and analysts say it could ease further due to an expected softening in property investment and construction as more cities try to cool housing prices, while a government campaign against riskier lending pushes up borrowing costs.

“Unequivocally, the property boom has peaked,” said Rosealea Yao, a property analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics.

China’s economy has surprised global financial markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in long-ailing “smokestack” industries such as steel and strong demand from Europe and the United States.

At the same time, there are concerns about the state’s growing role in the economy: the acceleration in year-on-year state investment growth outstripped private investment growth in September.

In the opening speech of congress this week, President Xi Jinping said China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth.

However, while expressing support for market reform and private firms, Xi also called for stronger, bigger state firms.

ROOM FOR MORE

While policymakers’ efforts to curb property market speculation and cut debt are hurting growth in some parts of the economy, activity has been supported by better-than-expected expansion in trade and bank lending.

Beijing has set a modest growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2017, theoretically allowing policymakers more room for structural reforms.

China’s factory output grew 6.6 percent year-on-year in September, beating expectations, while fixed-asset investment expanded 7.5 percent in January-September, missing forecasts.

Retail sales rose 10.3 percent in September from a year earlier, beating expectations. Disposable income grew 7.5 percent in the first nine months of the year, the fastest rate in two years.

Data last week showed China’s import and export growth accelerated in September, suggesting healthy momentum in trade. China’s banks also extended more loans than expected last month, buoyed by demand from home buyers and companies.

“Given that the growth outcome is above the government’s target, there is room for some more reforms and it might come after the politburo meeting,” said Besa Deda, chief economist at St George Bank in Sydney.

But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East.

Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.

“We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,” said the bloc’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini.

The EU leaders’ joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday, “reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal”.

The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall.

Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a programme the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.

The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said.

Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would “shred” it.

The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea.

In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile programme and its regional political role.

“We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don’t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,” an EU official said.

“If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic programme and Iran’s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.”

Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile programme would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The EU, which has expressed “concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions” in the Middle East, has said these issues should be discussed without direct links to the nuclear deal.

“They were never very fond of the nuclear deal in the first place but now the situation has changed a lot. Both many Democrats as well as some Republicans feel like they need to play a more active role on foreign policy to restrain the president,” the official said.",EU leaders talk up Iran nuclear deal hoping to save it from Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-eu/eu-leaders-talk-up-iran-nuclear-deal-hoping-to-save-it-from-trump-idINKBN1CO3A6?il=0

SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin launched one of his most stinging critiques of U.S. foreign policy on Thursday, listing what he called some of the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.

He declined to say if he would run for a fourth presidential term in an election set for March, though he is expected to stand after dominating Russian politics for 18 years.

Instead, he used a high-profile televised discussion with foreign academics in southern Russia to reach back to what he regards as the darkest days of U.S.-Russia relations.

Opinion polls suggest that harsh rhetoric towards the West plays well with many Russian voters, who credit Putin for restoring national pride and standing up to what they see as Western encroachment.

Asked by a Germany-based academic to identify what mistakes Moscow had made in its relations with the West, Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi:

“Our biggest mistake was that we trusted you too much. You interpreted our trust as weakness and you exploited that.”

Visibly angry at times, Putin cast Russia as the wronged party and its post-Soviet leadership as too naive and trusting.

“Unfortunately, our Western partners, having divided the USSR’s geopolitical legacy, were certain of their own incontestable righteousness having declared themselves the victors of the ‘Cold War,'” said Putin.

“They started to openly interfere in the sovereign affairs of countries and to export democracy in the same way as in their time the Soviet leadership tried to export the Socialist revolution to the whole world.”

Putin said U.S.-Russia relations were in a lamentable state, referencing an “unprecedented” anti-Russian campaign in the United States, the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities there and pressure on Russian media by U.S. authorities.

He did not single out U.S. President Donald Trump for personal criticism, but said Trump’s behavior was unpredictable as a result of political foes who were preventing him from fulfilling almost all of his policy pledges.

Putin said the United States was trying to squeeze Russia out of European energy markets with its latest batch of sanctions, which Trump grudgingly signed into law in August after Congress approved them.

“The recent sanctions package adopted by the U.S. Congress was openly designed to push Russia out of European energy markets and to force Europe to switch to more expensive liquefied natural gas from the United States, even though the volumes there are not yet sufficient,” he said.

He criticized Trump’s predecessors, describing how he believed the United States had betrayed Russia in the 1990s by not reciprocating what he called the unprecedented access Moscow gave Washington to Russia’s secret nuclear facilities.

He said the United States had flouted nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, saying Moscow had diligently complied with the same pacts only to be repeatedly let down by the United States.

His speech and ripostes in a punchy question and answer session that followed often sounded like a history lesson.

The United States had tried to stir up separatism in southern Russia in the 1990s, said Putin, something he said he knew for a fact from his stint leading the FSB spy agency.

The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and NATO’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia were bad, he said.

And in comments that could have been drawn straight from the pages of the Cold War, Putin accused the United States of upsetting the strategic nuclear balance by modernizing its arsenal of weapons.

Russia would develop new weapons systems, he pledged, if it was forced to, and if the United States withdrew from a landmark arms control treaty -- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- Russia would hit back fast.

“From our side, the response will be instant, and I want to warn, symmetrical,” said Putin.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Thursday reaffirmed their full commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, hoping that the U.S. Congress would not let it collapse despite relentless criticism by President Donald Trump.

But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran’s ballistic missile program and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East.

Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.

“We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,” said the bloc’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini.

The EU leaders’ joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday, “reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal”.

The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall.

Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a program the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.

The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said.

Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would “shred” it.

The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea.

In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile program and its regional political role.

“We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don’t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,” an EU official said.

“If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic program and Iran’s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.”

Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The EU, which has expressed “concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions” in the Middle East, has said these issues should be discussed without direct links to the nuclear deal.

“They were never very fond of the nuclear deal in the first place but now the situation has changed a lot. Both many Democrats as well as some Republicans feel like they need to play a more active role on foreign policy to restrain the president,” the official said.",EU leaders talk up Iran nuclear deal hoping to save it from Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CO1L7

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel refused to give up on the Formula One championship on Thursday and found support from title favorite Lewis Hamilton.

Hamilton leads the German by 59 points with four races left and the Mercedes driver can take his fourth championship in Sunday’s U.S. Grand Prix if he finishes in the top two and results go his way.

“In English, they say it’s not over until the fat lady sings,” Vettel told reporters in the U.S. Grand Prix paddock. “We need to make sure she shuts up for quite a while.”

Vettel led the championship from the opening race in Australia in March until last month but three races in the Far East and Hamilton’s string of wins have shredded his chances.

The Ferrari driver was caught in a collision with team mate Kimi Raikkonen in Singapore and crashed out on the opening lap, then suffered an engine failure in qualifying in Malaysia that left him last on the grid.

He raced back to fourth that time but in Japan was sidelined by a broken spark plug.

“We are still in there, our chances are slimmer than they have been some races ago. There is a chance. We’re going for it,” said the four times world champion.

“We need to stay focused. We have a great car, we had a package to win the last couple of races. As it happens, we didn’t. But that doesn’t mean we have no chance to win the next races.”

Hamilton, who has won in Austin four times in the last five years, said talk of wrapping up the title in Texas - as he did two years ago - was overblown.

“I think the talk of the championship win this weekend is silly really...you can’t expect them to have a difficult weekend again,” he said.

“They’re going to be quick, they have an opportunity to win. The championship, as long as it’s done in the next four races, that’s my focus. I honestly couldn’t care less if it’s here on the last race, as long as it’s done.”

Hamilton also expected Ferrari to bring some sort of upgrade to Austin.

“They’ve definitely had a couple of hiccups but I anticipate they’ll be very strong this weekend and for the last four races - so that’s why nothing changes for me,” he added.",Motor racing: Vettel hopes to keep the fat lady quiet,https://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-usa-title/vettel-hopes-to-keep-the-fat-lady-quiet-idINKBN1CO38T

Il Codacons ha contestato lo stop alle sanzioni nei confronti del vettore irlandese: “L‘Ente per l‘aviazione ha deciso di salvare Ryanair, che se la cava senza nemmeno un rimprovero, nonostante abbia arrecato danni morali e patrimoniali enormi ai viaggiatori italiani”, spiega in una nota il presidente del Codacons, Carlo Rienzi.

The shift, reflected in a Morningstar Inc report released on Thursday, shows how the $200 billion-plus Fidelity Freedom Funds franchise is taking a slightly more defensive posture in portfolios that invest the retirement savings of more than 6 million American workers.

Fidelity said that in September, the Freedom Funds cut exposure to international growth and value stocks while reducing its overweight to emerging market equities.

Across all the Freedom Funds’ strategies, Fidelity cut the emerging markets overweight exposure to 2-3 percent from the previous level of 3-4 percent, company spokeswoman Nicole Goodnow said.

“We continue to maintain an overweight position in (emerging market) equity after this move, but the size of the overweight has been reduced,” Goodnow said.

Some of the money taken from the overseas stocks was shifted into Canadian stocks and long-term U.S. Treasury paper, Fidelity said.

The $30 billion Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund (FFFDX.O), for example, cut its exposure to an emerging market stocks fund to 6.88 percent of assets in September from 7.94 percent in the prior month. The overweight exposure to emerging markets was cut to 2.5 percent from 3.5 percent, Goodnow said.

Meanwhile, the 2020 fund boosted its exposure to a newly formed Canada stocks fund to 0.62 percent of assets from 0.11 percent in the previous month, Fidelity disclosures show.

Fidelity Freedom Funds operate as a fund-of-funds structure in which each age-based portfolio invests in about two dozen underlying Fidelity funds. The 2020 fund, for example, is for investors who plan to retire near that date.

During September, $1.8 billion was pulled from the $16 billion Fidelity Series Emerging Markets Fund, which has become one of the largest single holdings in Freedom Fund portfolios, according to Morningstar. By contrast, more than $900 million streamed into the Fidelity Series Canada Fund. It has $1.5 billion in assets since being formed in August to become an investment option in Freedom Fund portfolios.

In recent years, Fidelity Freedom Funds have increased their exposure to overseas stocks, including emerging markets.

Peking (Reuters) - Öffnung für ausländische Investoren, Abbau von Kreditrisiken, Umbau der Industrie: China will mit einer Reihe von Reformen das Wachstum seiner Wirtschaft sichern. Diese zeigt sich derzeit in guter Form. Trotz einer minimalen Abkühlung in den Sommermonaten dürfte sich der Aufschwung in der nach den USA zweitgrößten Volkswirtschaft der Welt 2017 verstärken - zum ersten Mal seit sieben Jahren.

“Wir werden ausländischen Banken mehr Raum geben”, kündigte der Chef der Bankenaufsicht Guo Shuqing, auf dem Parteinkongress an. Der Marktanteil ausländischer Banken in der Volksrepublik habe sich in den vergangenen zehn Jahren auf 1,2 Prozent halbiert. “Das ist kein Vorteil für den Wettbewerb und Strukturverbesserungen”, sagte Guo. Er signalisierte zudem, die Regeln für den Abbau fauler Kredite zu verschärfen. Finanzrisiken müssten ebenso eingedämmt werden wie ein Anstieg versteckter Schulden. Die Verschuldung, die etwa 258 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsproduktes ausmacht, gilt als eines der größten Konjunkturrisiken. Die Rating-Agentur S&P stufte erst im September die Kreditwürdigkeit des Landes herab, da “eine längere Phase des starken Kreditwachstums die ökonomischen und finanziellen Risiken Chinas erhöht hat”.

Die Zentralbank ist sich des Problems bewusst. Ihr Chef Zhou Xiaochuan warnte am Rande des Kongresses vor einem “Minsky Moment”. Er spielte damit auf eine nach dem amerikanischen Ökonom Hyman Minsky benannte Theorie an, wonach trotz boomender Wirtschaft eine plötzliche Krise auftreten kann. “Wir sollten uns darauf konzentrieren, dramatischen Anpassungen vorzubeugen”, sagte Zhou mit Blick auf die hohe Verschuldung der Unternehmen und steigender Verbraucherkredite.

Die Regierung geht bereits gegen eine drohende Immobilienpreisblase vor, was derzeit den Aufschwung leicht dämpft. Das Bruttoinlandsprodukt stieg im dritten Quartal um 6,8 Prozent zum Vorjahreszeitraum. Im ersten Halbjahr hatte es noch zu 6,9 Prozent gereicht. Trotz des etwas verlangsamten Tempos dürfte das von der Regierung vorgegebene Ziel von rund 6,5 Prozent für das Gesamtjahr übertroffen werden. Die Konjunktur sei stabil, sagte der Sprecher des Statistikamtes Xing Zhihong. 2016 hatte es mit 6,7 Prozent das kleinste Plus seit 26 Jahren gegeben. Dieser Wert dürfte in diesem Jahr übertroffen werden, erwarten Experten nach den ersten drei Quartalen.

Bremsspuren hinterließ in den Sommermonaten der Bausektor. Die Zahl der Neubauten nahm nicht mehr so stark zu, während der Verkauf von Bestandsimmobilien im September sogar erstmals seit mehr als zweieinhalb Jahren sank. “Der Immobilienboom hat zweifellos seinen Höhepunkt überschritten”, sagte Analystin Rosealea Yao vom Beratungsunternehmen Gavekal Dragonomics. Um Überhitzungen vorzubeugen, hat die Regierung beispielsweise die Vergabe risikoreicher Kredite erschwert.

Gestützt wird der Aufschwung vom Außenhandel und der Industrie, die von der besseren Weltkonjunktur profitiert. Die Firmen stellten im September 6,6 Prozent mehr her als vor Jahresfrist. Das ist mehr als Experten für möglich gehalten hatten. Sie bereiten sich damit auch auf den Winter vor, in dem die Regierung immer wieder im Kampf gegen die Luftverschmutzung Fabriken stilllegt. Der Einzelhandel schaffte im September ein überraschend kräftiges Umsatzplus von 10,3 Prozent.

“Derzeit braucht man sich um das chinesische Wachstum nicht zu sorgen”, sagte der Chefvolkswirt der VP Bank, Thomas Gitzel. “Auch in den kommenden Quartalen dürfte die Volkswirtschaft in ähnlicher Größenordnung zulegen, dafür wird alleine schon die Regierung sorgen.” Präsident Xi Jinping kündigte auf dem Parteikongress eine Öffnung des Dienstleistungssektors sowie eine Reform des Devisen- und Finanzsystems an. Bis 2035 solle China eines der innovativsten Länder der Welt werden, das seine Umweltprobleme grundlegend gelöst habe. In der Binnenwirtschaft will Xi den privaten Konsum als Grundlage für die weitere Entwicklung ankurbeln.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street a fini sur une note étale jeudi, le Dow Jones et le S&P-500 parvenant à effacer leurs pertes en toute fin de séance malgré un recul de 2,37% d‘Apple et des prises de bénéfice sur de nombreuses autres valeurs technologiques.

Trente ans jour pour jour après le krach de 1987 qui l‘avait vu perdre 508 points (22,6%) en une séance, l‘indice Dow Jones a fini sur un gain symbolique de 5,44 points ou 0,02% à 23.163,04, 110 points au-dessus de son point bas du jour à 23.052.

Le Standard & Poor‘s-500, plus large, a gagné 0,84 point, soit 0,03%, à 2.562,10 alors que le Nasdaq Composite a reculé de 19,15 points (0,29%) à 6.605,07, plombé par Apple.

Le marché a réagi positivement en fin de séance à une information de presse selon laquelle Jerome Powell, un des gouverneurs de la Réserve fédérale, aurait la préférence de la Maison blanche pour succéder à Janet Yellen à la tête de la banque centrale en février prochain.

Powell est considéré comme un Républicain modéré qui assurerait une continuité à la tête de la Fed, avec notamment le maintien de taux à un bas niveau, si Yellen n‘est pas désignée pour un deuxième mandat.

L‘article de Politico a fait reculer le dollar et les rendements des emprunts d‘Etat américains.

A Wall Street, la séance avait jusque-là dominée par le recul d‘Apple sur fond d‘inquiétudes pour les ventes de son smartphone iPhone 8 avant le lancement début novembre du nouvel iPhone X.

Le titre a lâché 2,37% à 155,98 dollars, la plus forte baisse du Dow.

D‘autres poids lourds technologiques ont subi des prises de bénéfice à l‘image d‘Amazon et d‘Alphabet, la maison mère de Google, qui ont tous deux perdu plus de 1%.

“L‘impact d‘Apple a plombé toute la cote”, commente Phil Blancato, directeur de Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management à New York. “Leur plan marketing laisse à désirer, sachant qu‘il y a deux nouveaux téléphones et qu‘on est à deux semaines seulement de la sortie du deuxième. Si vraiment il est révolutionnaire, je ne comprends pas le calcul.”

Le secteur des techs, ajoute-t-il, était vulnérable à des prises de bénéfices après avoir pris plus de 30% depuis le début de l‘année et contribué largement aux records en série des trois principaux indices de Wall Street.

L‘indice S&P des technologiques a cédé 0,35%.

TRAVELERS EN TÊTE DU DOW APRÈS SES RÉSULTATS

Six des 11 grands indices sectoriels S&P-500 ont fini en hausse, avec en tête le compartiment défensif des services aux collectivités (+1,01%).

Le secteur de la santé (+0,61%) a profité de la hausse de 4,71% du fabricant d‘équipements médicaux Danaher, qui a atteint un record après des résultats trimestriels meilleurs que prévu.

Les télécoms ont pris 0,46% sous l‘impulsion de Verizon, qui s‘est adjugé 1,15% en réaction à ses résultats du troisième trimestre.

L‘indice sectoriel de l‘énergie a en revanche cédé 0,31% avec les cours du brut qui ont subi des prises de bénéfice.

Parmi les valeurs individuelles, United Airlines, la troisième compagnie aérienne américaine, a chuté de 12,08%, la plus forte baisse du S&P-500, après l‘annonce d‘une baisse de son bénéfice au troisième trimestre et de prévisions jugées décevantes pour le trimestre en cours.

Parmi les rares techs à tirer leur épingle du jeu, l‘éditeur de logiciels Adobe a bondi de 12,2418, la meilleure performance du S&P-500, en réaction à des prévisions de bénéfice annuel supérieures aux attentes. Cette hausse porte l‘avance du créateur de Photoshop à plus de 65% depuis le début de l‘année.

Les deux meilleurs performances du Dow Jones ont été pour l‘assureur Travelers (+2,42%), soutenu par des résultats trimestriels meilleurs que prévu, et General Electric qui a pris 1,99% avant de publier à son tour ses résultats vendredi.","Wall Street finit stable, Apple plombe le Nasdaq",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRKBN1CO2YS-OFRBS

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Free markets sound like such a good idea. They offer choice and opportunities, which are good things. And who does not want freedom? Besides, if the alternative to these markets is the impassive, incompetent bureaucratic state, then the policy path is obvious. Let markets go free and peg back governments, so their only role in the productive economy is to deal with the occasional failure of markets to work as they should.

This story of private sector freedom and state sector sloth is often told. In the United States, profit-hungry entrepreneurs are considered economic heroes. Even in more social democratic Europe, few politicians or commentators publicly doubt that the profit motive is almost always the best way to get things done.

As with all good myths, there is a thin tie to reality. The Soviet Union showed that economies stagnate without private enterprise. However, communist Russia is long gone. The pairing of good free markets and bad governments should be evaluated by the standard of what is actually happening. By that measure, the story makes no sense, for four reasons.

First, markets and governments are not enemies. Markets are created and sustained by law and they thrive in well-governed societies. Complex modern economies cannot thrive without extensive regulation, and only governments can ensure that rules actually serve the common good.

Second, free markets sometimes subvert that common good. Take the pharmaceutical industry. It certainly produces many useful products, but the search for ever higher profits has led too many companies to focus on drugs which patients have to take for many years, rather than on antibiotics, which cure quickly and usually cheaply. In the United States, the industry’s blind dedication to profits has contributed to the wild over-prescription of opioid painkillers, helping to spawn a public health crisis.

Third, the private-public split is too simple. Many important institutions are neither one nor the other. In healthcare, education, scientific research and public infrastructure, much of the work may ultimately be under government control, but the leading organisations are mostly self-perpetuating and self-governing bodies. Mostly they serve the common good fairly well.

Finally, not-for-profit organisations have advantages over market players. Taxpayers and donors can fund projects which are too risky for private investors. Organisations with a public responsibility can work on socially useful projects which will never generate a big cash profit. These attributes give the government a much wider remit than just resolving market failures.

The free market myth will not go away on its own. It needs to be replaced. One potential substitute, the old narrative of the social market or social democracy, has lost its appeal. Perhaps voters should be grateful that the mixed economy has given them the highest level of prosperity and economic security ever seen. They are not thankful. On the contrary, they are increasingly tempted by populist narratives which condemn, among other things, stultifying government bureaucracy.

It is true that many government agencies have lost their way. All institutions tend to become rigid over time, but governments have an additional problem with morale. It’s hard to be imaginative and energetic when you’re frequently told that your only job is to pick up the messes left by the generally much more competent private sector.

The free-market answer to all problems is to shrink the government, but that would only make everything worse. The modern economy is a shared project which cannot work well without a vibrant non-private sector. If that sector is tired and beaten down, it needs to be encouraged and revived. University College London (UCL), itself a pretty vibrant non-private institution, has launched a project with exactly that goal. The Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose is run by economist Mariana Mazzucato. Her book “The Entrepreneurial State”, a defence of the contributions and potential of government in the modern economy, inspires the IIPP’s motto: entrepreneurial societies need entrepreneurial states.

Mazzucato has gathered an impressive selection of big names in the non-private economy on the IIPP’s advisory board, from James Galbraith, who teaches about the economic role of government at the University of Texas, to Mike Bracken, who led the successful effort to create user-friendly websites for the British government.

But the names on the board – and the chat at last week’s launch party in London – also show how much work remains to be done. Almost all the people listening enthusiastically to the narrative of the central role of the non-private sector were already well ensconced in that part of the economy.

To get past preaching to the converted, the new story has to persuade politicians. There are few signs of that happening. The private sector is even less interested. Shareholder value is still the norm and government is still generally treated as either an enemy or a tool to be manipulated in the fight for competitive advantage.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google is offering security experts a bounty to identify Android app flaws as the Alphabet Inc unit seeks to wipe out bugs from its Google Play store.

Each flaw will score at least $1,000 under the program announced on Thursday to back up automated checks that have failed to block malware and other problems that security experts say infect the 8-year-old app store far more than Apple Inc’s rival App Store.

Google will partner with HackerOne, a bug bounty program management website, to target a list of apps and flaws such as those that allow a hacker to redirect a user to a phishing website or infect a gadget with a virus.

Software scans cannot match a person’s ability to discover “a truly creative hack,” Vineet Buch, director of product management for Google Play Apps and Games, said in an interview.

The Google Play Security Reward Program effectively sponsors research into software created by other companies. Bug bounties by Microsoft Corp, Apple and Alphabet have been awarded only for tracing flaws in their own software.

“We don’t just care about our own apps, but rather the overall health of the ecosystem,” Buch said. “It’s like offering a reward for a missing person even if you don’t know who the missing person is personally.”

Google did not reveal the funding for its program, but said it would start small.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering tightening the vetting process for women and children seeking to enter the United States as refugees, a proposal that if adopted would bring security checks closer to those for adult men, three sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters.

The plan could slow down refugee admissions even after the end of a 120-day ban on most refugees instituted by the Trump administration while it reviews vetting procedures. The vetting review is set to end on Oct. 24.

President Donald Trump came into office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with the hard-line immigration policies that were a focal point of the Republican’s 2016 election campaign. Trump quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from some Middle Eastern and African countries that were challenged in court.

A U.S. official told reporters last month that the administration is “considering a wide range of potential measures and enhancements” to vetting.

Refugees currently undergo differing levels of security checks when applying for admission to the United States, depending on the perceived risk they might present, including running their biographic and biometric data against law enforcement and intelligence databases.

Women and young children go through a lower level of security screening than men, said the three sources with knowledge of the proposal, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The proposed changes would bring their security checks more in line with what is required for adult male refugees.

Successive Republican and Democratic administrations have focused most of their attention on adult men who tend to join militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State in greater numbers than women.

A State Department official declined to comment on any refugee vetting processes while the review is underway. The government is taking steps to “further intensify” refugee screening “to uphold the safety of the American people,” the official said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesman Dave Lapan declined to comment, and said the administration is “finalizing security enhancement recommendations as part of the 120-day review.”

A White House spokeswoman said there were “no announcements at this time.”

All refugees referred for resettlement in the United States are run through a database with watch-list information, called the Consular Lookout and Support System, or CLASS. Refugees can be singled out for a higher level of review based on their age, nationality, or gender. Syrian refugees, for instance, undergo extra checks.

Of the nearly 85,000 refugees admitted to the United States in the 2016 fiscal year, about 72 percent were women or children, according to the State Department. Total processing time for refugees to enter the United States now averages about 18 to 24 months, according to the State Department.

Trump’s order to halt refugee admissions so his administration could determine whether additional checks are necessary was suspended for months by federal judges. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually allowed it to go in effect for all refugees except those with close ties to the United States.

Trump also lowered the maximum number of refugees to be allowed into the United States in 2017 to 50,000 from the 110,000 originally set by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The 2018 level has been set at 45,000, the lowest number in decades.","Trump administration weighs tighter vetting for women, children refugees: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-refugees/trump-administration-weighs-tighter-vetting-for-women-children-refugees-sources-idUSKBN1CO35P

Gerard Pique was sent off two minutes before halftime for two bookings, one for tugging an opponent’s shirt and the other for slapping the ball into the net, but Barca were barely threatened by a hapless Olympiakos side who are badly under-performing in their Greek title defence.

The Athens club, who won three league titles and two domestic Cups under current Barca coach Ernesto Valverde, are fifth in the standings in the Greek top flight and have lost all their games in the Champions League.

Barca took the lead in the 18th minute on a rainswept evening at a sparsely attended Nou Camp when visiting defender Dimitrios Nikolaou turned Gerard Deulofeu’s cross into his own net.

It was the fifth own goal Barca have benefited from this season in all competitions.

The Argentine then carved his way through the hapless visiting defence moments later to tee up France left back Lucas Digne to score his first goal in the Champions League for Barca.

Greek defender Nikolaou put the ball in the net for the second time in the game by heading home from a corner at the other end to give Olympiakos a scantly-deserved consolation goal in the 89th minute.

QUEBEC CITY, Quebec (Reuters) - Quebec will ban face coverings for people giving or receiving provincial government services under a law passed on Wednesday that rights groups have criticized as marginalizing Muslim women in the mainly French-speaking Canadian province.

While the law, which takes effect by July 1, 2018, does not specify which face coverings are prohibited, the debate has largely focused on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers.

Like France, which passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004, Quebec has struggled to reconcile its secular identity with a growing Muslim population, many of them North African emigrants.

“We are just saying that for reasons linked to communication, identification and safety, public services should be given and received with an open face,” Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard told reporters in the province’s National Assembly.

“We are in a free and democratic society. You speak to me, I should see your face, and you should see mine. It’s as simple as that,” he said.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims said it was deeply concerned by the law’s passage and was looking at its legal options.

“This legislation is an unjustified infringement of religious freedoms,” said executive director Ihsaan Gardee.

The law allows for exemptions under certain circumstances, although it did not provide details. Regulations setting out how the new law will be enforced are yet to come.

Asked in the federal parliament whether he would challenge the law, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who represents a Montreal district, said he would continue to ensure all Canadians are protected by the country’s charter of rights and freedoms, “while respecting the choices that different legislative assemblies can make.”

France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have imposed restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils in public places, with Denmark on track to set its own ban.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

So yes, mining bosses should follow accounting rules.","LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rio Tinto bought a coal mine in Mozambique in 2011 for too much money. U.S. and UK regulators now say it came clean about the real, diminished value of the mine too late. The second type of problem is less likely to recur. Rio has settled one case already and, in any event, the accounting rules for writing down badly priced acquisitions are relatively clear. If only there were similar safeguards against mining bosses getting carried away with deals in the first place.

Tom Albanese, who was the boss of Rio Tinto six years ago, paid $3.7 billion for Riversdale Mining. That was around three-quarters more than the price at which it had been trading in September 2010. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said on Oct. 17 that the board felt the premium was justified, even though internal reports had warned that this may not be the case. The problems turned out to be twofold: the mine had less recoverable coal than Rio thought, and its plan to ship the stuff out on barges proved unrealistic. The inevitable writedown came in January 2013.

When to write down the value of a business is subjective, but not entirely so. Accounting rules oblige businesses to look regularly for signs that an asset’s worth may have changed. In Rio’s case, the UK regulator says that those warnings didn’t reach the audit committee. Where the U.S. regulator sees fraud, its British peer sees poor judgement. Regardless, there was a strong incentive at the time to wait and see whether a writedown would be necessary. Albanese had already presided over huge writedowns from the poorly timed acquisition of aluminium miner Alcan.

Albanese and his then-finance director have gone, but the incentive to get carried away with the resources cycle hasn’t. Company bosses, often former miners, usually want to dig more rather than less. Governments in resource-rich frontier markets remain unpredictable. And miners’ debt levels have come down, giving them more firepower. Acquisitions in the mining sector almost doubled in the first half of 2017 compared with a year earlier, consultancy EY says. So yes, mining bosses should follow accounting rules.

(Reuters) - Michelin a fait état jeudi d‘une hausse de 3% de son chiffre d‘affaires au troisième trimestre grâce à ses augmentations de tarifs et confirmé ses objectifs annuels malgré une dégradation attendue des effets de changes.

Le fabricant de pneumatiques, numéro deux mondial par les ventes derrière le japonais Bridgestone, a réalisé sur les trois derniers mois une chiffre d‘affaires de 5,33 milliards d‘euros. Le consensus des sept analystes interrogés par Inquiry Financial pour Reuters donnait 5,35 milliards.

“Sur la fin de l‘année 2017 et indépendamment des conditions hivernales à venir, les marchés de remplacement devraient retrouver progressivement leur tendance de long terme”, a déclaré le groupe clermontois dans un communiqué. “La demande en première monte devrait rester bien orientée en poids lourd, génie civil et agricole, l‘activité tourisme camionnette présentant une croissance moindre.”

Michelin profite en effet du rebond observé depuis la fin 2016 de l‘activité minière, reflet de la fin du déstockage et de la reprise de l‘activité d‘extraction. Au troisième trimestre, ce marché qui utilise des pneus géants pouvant aller jusqu‘à 4 mètres de haut et peser jusqu‘à cinq tonnes, a grimpé de 10% à 15%.

Au cours d‘une téléconférence, le directeur financier Marc Henry a dit anticiper une poursuite de cette tendance vigoureuse en 2018.

La demande des constructeurs de voitures est plus volatile, avec une reprise en Europe au troisième trimestre après un premier semestre très contrasté, une légère reprise en Chine après un deuxième trimestre morose et une accentuation du ralentissement en Amérique du Nord.

Au total, les volumes de Michelin ont augmenté de 1% au troisième trimestre, l‘effet prix a grimpé de 4,4%, reflet des hausses de tarifs dans l‘activité remplacement et dans les activités indexées où le groupe répercute l‘évolution des matières premières (pétrole et caoutchouc). Il a ainsi pu plus que compenser un effet de changes négatif de 3,7% sur la période.

Michelin a revu en hausse son estimation de l‘impact négatif des devises sur l‘ensemble de l‘année, à une fourchette de -110 et -120 millions d‘euros alors qu‘il l‘attendait neutre fin juillet, puis compris entre -85 millions et -115 millions d‘euros au salon de l‘automobile de Francfort mi-septembre.

Le groupe a néanmoins confirmé ses objectifs 2017, libellés hors effet de change. Il table toujours sur une croissance de ses volumes en ligne avec le marché, sur une hausse de son résultat opérationnel sur activités courantes et sur un cash flow libre structurel supérieur à 900 millions d‘euros.

L‘effet matières premières reste quant à lui anticipé à -800 millions d‘euros sur l‘année.

(Reuters) - The New York Yankees, traditionally one of the most reviled teams in Major League Baseball due to its long history of success, are adjusting to a new label - likeable underdogs.

The team, which few predicted would make the playoffs in a rebuilding year, now find themselves one win away from the World Series after three successive victories against the Houston Astros to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.

“It’s really unusual to hear a Yankee team to be described that way,” manager Joe Girardi said Thursday when asked about the perception the side, nicknamed the “Evil Empire,” is easy to support this year.

”There are so many different talents that we see... we see guys that have reinvented themselves.

”We see rookies that came up and play extremely important roles. We see guys hit the ball out of the ballpark, in the gap, run.

“It’s really enjoyable for me to watch these guys do their work.”

The most electric player on the team is 6-foot-7, 282-pound Aaron Judge, whose batting power and defensive prowess in right field could earn him league MVP honors.

But while Judge understandably gets headlines, team chemistry has been key to the Yankees’ success.

La región italiana de Lombardía, motor industrial del país donde se encuentra la capital financiera de Milán, celebra el domingo un referéndum por una mayor autonomía. Su presidente, otrora un orgulloso secesionista, espera que el resultado atraiga más inversión.

Esto podría pasarle factura a Cataluña, que compite contra Lombardía en la carrera por atraer a los trabajadores que huyen de otro doloroso divorcio europeo: el Brexit. Las dos regiones se disputan la nueva sede del regulador farmacéutico europeo, que debe dejar Reino Unido y encontrar un nuevo hogar dentro de la Unión Europea.

“No somos Cataluña”, dijo el presidente de Lombardía, Roberto Maroni, divisando Milán desde su despacho acristalado del piso 36 de la reciente construida sede regional.

“Nos quedamos dentro de la nación italiana con más autonomía mientras que Cataluña quiere convertirse en el estado número 29 de la Unión Europea. Nosotros no. No de momento”.

Habla de Cataluña como competidora en algunos aspectos pero dice que no está invitando de forma deliberada a sus empresas. “No estamos celebrando que haya firmas que estén abandonando Cataluña. Veremos lo que pasa pero no he recibido ninguna solicitud todavía por parte de empresas catalanas”.

Maroni es un miembro líder de la Liga Norte, que tiene sus orígenes en la campaña de los años 90 por la independencia del estado de Padania, una zona que se extiende por el norte de Italia más o menos siguiendo el curso del río Po desde Lombardía, en el oeste, hasta Venecia, en el este.

La Liga Norte ya no hace campaña activa por la secesión, pero como partido gobernante de Lombardía y también de la región de Véneto alrededor de Venecia, está celebrando en ambos lugares referendos por una mayor autonomía, incluyendo un mejor acuerdo financiero con el gobierno central.

EL DINERO IMPORTA

En el caso de que el ‘sí’ ganase, el resultado no sería considerado vinculante por Roma, pero Maroni dijo que le otorgaría un mandato sólido para negociar un acuerdo mejor.

“Es obvio que cuanto más poder de negociación tengamos, más dinero podremos traer a casa”, dijo Maroni.

Roma dice que el referéndum es innecesario, aunque permitido bajo la constitución italiana, la cual permite a las regiones abrir negociaciones por una autonomía mayor. El partido gobernante en Italia, el Partido Democrático, es también neutral en este tema, aunque al menos uno de los alcaldes del partido en Lombardía está pidiendo votar por el ‘sí’.

Como Cataluña, Lombardía supone una quinta parte de la economía nacional y se queja de que el centro está drenando sus finanzas.

Pero, a diferencia de Cataluña, donde cientos de empresas han trasladado sus sedes sociales a otras regiones de España desde el referéndum del 1 de octubre, el presidente de Lombardía está abordando la cuestión de forma más moderada y utilizando la campaña por una mayor autonomía como cebo para la inversión.

Maroni dice que Lombardía paga cada año 54.000 millones de euros más en impuestos de lo que recibe de Roma y que quiere reducir esa diferencia a la mitad.

El presidente lombardo añade que gastaría parte de ese dinero en investigación y el desarrollo, en la promoción de negocios familiares y start-ups, y la exención temporal de impuestos para atraer a grandes firmas internacionales.

Maroni podría, por ejemplo, decirles a las grandes multinacionales que quieren invertir en Europa: “Sabed que si venís a Milán, no os haré pagar impuestos durante dos o tres años”.

Roma, sin embargo, no está dispuesta a dejar que la región italiana con más poder económico disfrute de esa lluvia de ganancias sin arriesgar el colapso económico del ya empobrecido sur, dicen los expertos.

“Es un juego de suma cero”, dijo el profesor Luca Ricolfi, un experto en federalismo de la Universidad de Turín.

“ITALIA NO PODRÍA SOBREVIVIR”

Gian Claudio Bressa, secretario de Asuntos Regionales en Roma, dijo que no era cuestión de simplemente devolver dinero.

Las regiones deben demostrar que pueden tomar el relevo del gobierno nacional para hacerse cargo de los servicios públicos y hacer un mejor trabajo a la hora de financiarlos. Tan solo entonces se le otorgaría más financiación a una región más autónoma, para ayudarla a costear dichos servicios adicionales.

“Italia es un estado unitario basado en la solidaridad fiscal mutua entre regiones”, dijo Bressa.

“Para poder obtener más dinero del estado central, Lombardía debería demostrar que los servicios ofrecidos son mejores en comparación con los proporcionados por el estado. Si 27.000 millones de euros fuesen utilizados para algo distinto a esos servicios, Italia desde luego no podría sobrevivir”.

Aunque hubiese un importante porcentaje de votos por el ‘sí’ en los referéndum del domingo, los expertos no esperan un cambio rápido o dramático.

Lombardía podría considerar una victoria el conseguir que se le transfiriesen algunas responsabilidades más y le otorgasen alrededor de 1.000 o 2.000 millones de euros de financiación adicional, dijo Ricolfi, de la Universidad de Turín.

Políticamente, sin embargo, exacerbaría las tensiones entre el adinerado norte y el empobrecido sur, además de debilitar las costuras que unen a una nación que antes de su unificación en el siglo XIX estaba constituida por un grupo de pequeños estados regionales que hablaban una variedad de distintos dialectos.

“Si se abre la caja de lo que pagan las regiones del norte, cabe esperar una respuesta negativa en el sur de Italia”, dijo Giovanni Orsina, profesor de historia en la Universidad Luiss-Guido Carli en Roma.","""No somos Cataluña"": los separatistas italianos avanzan con suavidad hacia la autonomía",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idESKBN1CO1Q9-OESEN

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - T-Mobile US et Sprint comptent annoncer leur fusion sans cessions d‘actifs dans l‘immédiat, les deux groupes de télécommunications comptant négocier ensuite ce point-là avec les autorités de tutelle, ont déclaré dimanche des sources proches du dossier.

Reuters avait rapporté la semaine passée que certains membres du département concurrence du Trésor américain doutaient que cette opération, rapprochant les troisième et quatrième opérateurs télécoms mobiles américains, puisse se faire en l‘état.

T-Mobile US, filiale de Deutsche Telekom, et Sprint, contrôlé par le groupe japonais Softbank, pensent annoncer leur fusion fin octobre ou début novembre et mettre surtout l‘accent sur les avantages qu‘elle comporterait pour le consommateur américain, en particulier dans la promotion de la future technologie 5G, ont expliqué les sources.

T-Mobile et Sprint se sont refusé à tout commentaire.

“Il vaut mieux pour Sprint et T-Mobile apprendre des régulateurs quelles sont leurs préoccupations puis voir comment il est possible d‘y répondre”, dit Craig Moffett, analyste de MoffettNathanson.

L‘entité née de la fusion représenterait plus de 130 millions d‘abonnés, se classant juste derrière Verizon Communications et AT&T.

Son chiffre d‘affaires dépasserait 70 milliards de dollars (58,50 milliards d‘euros) et les analystes estiment très élevé le potentiel de réduction des coûts.

John Hodulik, analyste d‘UBS, estime que la Commission fédérale des Communications (FCC) obligera sans doute les deux opérateurs à céder certaines fréquences car la nouvelle entité aurait le plus grand nombre de fréquences de moins de 300 MHz, devant Verizon et AT&T.

Disposer d‘un large spectre de fréquences est particulièrement important pour développer la 5G, surtout face à la concurrence des services à haut débit des câblo-opérateurs.

Les actionnaires de Sprint ne bénéficieront que d‘une prime modeste, voire inexistante, dans cette fusion, ce qui veut dire que Softbank et d‘autres actionnaires de Sprint auront autour de 40% de la nouvelle structure. Deutsche Telekom et les autres actionnaires de T-Mobile US auront le reste.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because the White House has not been forthcoming with details of an ambush in Niger that left four U.S. soldiers dead.

The attack earlier this month, which U.S. officials suspect was carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African country, which has about 800 U.S. troops.

“It may require a subpoena,” McCain said when asked what steps his committee might need to take to determine what happened to the four troops.

Questioned what information the committee still needed, McCain said: “Everything.”

Asked whether the White House had been forthcoming with the information needed by the committee, he added, “of course not.”

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a Pentagon investigation is aimed at finding out what happened in Niger.

“An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll. The fact is, they need to find out what happened and why it happened,” he said during an appearance in the White House briefing room.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military’s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

Initially, the Pentagon announced that three soldiers had been killed in the ambush. The body of a fourth soldier, Sergeant La David T. Johnson, was recovered more than a day later and questions have been raised about why it took as long as it did.

“The U.S. military does not leave its troops behind and I would just ask that you not question the actions of the troops who were caught in the firefight and question whether or not they did everything they could in order to bring everyone out at once,” Mattis said before the start of a meeting with his Israeli counterpart.

McCain said he had had a good conversation with President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and hoped the White House would eventually provide the information needed by the committee.

From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles.

The mission had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for America’s elite commandos and there was no armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.

Mattis said contact was considered “unlikely” but did not provide further details.

“There’s a reason we have U.S. Army soldiers there and not the Peace Corps, because we carry guns. And so it’s a reality, it’s part of the danger that our troops face,” he said.

Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead.

U.S. officials have said French aircraft were overhead within 30 minutes.

Mattis said a contract aircraft evacuated the dead U.S. soldiers and Johnson’s body was found later by local nationals.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the soldiers were in the area to establish relations with local leaders and deemed it unlikely that they would meet resistance.",Senator McCain says subpoena may be required to get answers on Niger ambush,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-niger-usa-military/senator-mccain-says-subpoena-may-be-required-to-get-answers-on-niger-ambush-idUSKBN1CO2VE?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Segundo uma das fontes, para manter sua influência sobre a Infraero, o PR está exigindo a suspensão da concessão de Congonhas e, em troca, prometeu votar para derrubar a denúncia contra Temer no plenário da Câmara na próxima semana. “É um toma lá, da cá, que pode jogar tudo (a concessão de Congonhas) por água abaixo”, disse a fonte.

Mais cedo neste ano, o Ministério dos Transportes, comandado pelo ministro Maurício Quintella, se movimentava para conceder o aeroporto carioca de Santos Dumont, em vez de Congonhas. O próprio Quintella, uma indicação do PR, em meados de agosto afirmou que sua pasta entendia que a concessão de Congonhas “não era a melhor solução”.

O ministro costumava argumentar que a concessão de Congonhas, um aeroporto gerador de receitas, poderia prejudicar a sustentabilidade da Infraero.

Segundo a primeira fonte, o PR defende para o aeroporto paulistano, um dos principais geradores de receita para a Infraero, um projeto batizado de Inova Congonhas, que envolve a concessão de todas as áreas comerciais do terminal, como lojas, restaurantes e estacionamento, deixando as operações ligadas aos pousos e decolagens a cargo da Infraero. O plano atual do governo é conceder todo o aeroporto.

“A receita não operacional é maior do que a operacional. Sem a área comercial não tem como conceder Congonhas”, disse essa fonte. Ela acrescentou que para minimizar o impacto da perda da concessão de Congonhas, o governo poderá incluir no pacote de concessão de terminais de 2018 o aeroporto da Pampulha, em Belo Horizonte. A arrecadação estimada para Pampulha é de 1 bilhão de reais.

A segunda fonte ouvida pela Reuters comentou que um sinal de que a pressão estaria fazendo algum efeito é o fato de que até o momento não foi publicado decreto presidencial confirmando a inclusão de Congonhas no Programa de Parcerias de Investimentos (PPI).

“Não sei se o governo vai ceder ou se vai adiar o processo. Mas as duas coisas são negativas, um atraso não seria recuperável e ameaça a execução financeira da concessão no ano que vem. O cronograma é apertado”, disse a segunda fonte.

Para a primeira fonte, “o governo virou um balcão de negócios para livrar o presidente (da denúncia). Do jeito que está a coisa, está muito difícil fazer a concessão de Congonhas”.

O presidente enfrenta uma segunda denúncia criminal, apresentada pelo ex-procurador-geral da República Rodrigo Janot, por organização criminosa e obstrução da Justiça. Essa denúncia foi rejeitada na quarta-feira pela Comissão de Constituição e Justiça (CCJ) da Câmara dos Deputados.

Cabe agora ao plenário da Casa votar o parecer pela rejeição da denúncia, o que deve ocorrer na próxima semana.

A primeira denúncia contra Temer, por corrupção passiva e também feita por Janot, foi rejeitada pela Câmara no início de agosto.

Procurado, o Ministério dos Transportes respondeu que “apesar de ter sido qualificada no PPI, a concessão de Congonhas continua sendo um ponto de atenção. Tendo em vista os impactos substanciais no desempenho orçamentário e financeiro da Infraero. O ministério avalia alternativas para minimizá-los.”

Já o PR negou que esteja fazendo negociação política em torno de Congonhas. Procurado, o partido disse que “o Partido da República é uma legenda da base de sustentação parlamentar do governo e não condiciona seus votos a qualquer pleito ou demanda”.

O PPI lembra que Congonhas foi incluído no programa de concessões em reunião no fim de agosto e afirma que o prazo para a publicação do decreto presidencial confirmando a decisão está dentro do normal.","Concessão de aeroporto de Congonhas esbarra em negociação política, dizem fontes",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CO2TX-OBRBS

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets were flat on Thursday as a report on President Donald Trump’s possible selection to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed Wall Street to the plus side and sent U.S. Treasury yields lower.

After the market slowly pared its gains throughout the latter portion of trading, a report from Politico that Trump was leaning toward nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen to head the U.S. central bank lifted both the Dow and S&P 500 into positive territory.

The Nasdaq remained in the red, however, weighed down by a 2.4 percent decline in Apple (AAPL.O) to $155.98 on signs of poor demand for its iPhone 8.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove. At least that’s the interpretation of his experience in history, and therefore with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber accommodative monetary policy is more welcome than the alternative, which would be the market speculating on (Trump) selecting somebody more hawkish in nature.”

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.3178 percent, from 2.339 percent late on Wednesday.

The greenback also weakened after the report. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.24 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.54 percent to $1.1851.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 5.44 points, or 0.02 percent, to 23,163.04, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.84 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,605.07.

Traders were marking 30 years to the day since the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, although many market participants considered another such crash unlikely.

European shares notched their largest drop in two months on concerns over political upheaval in Spain and after disappointing results from large companies such as Unilever, France’s Publicis and Germany’s Kion.

Spain’s central government said it would suspend Catalonia’s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region’s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.60 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02 percent.

Madrid's IBEX .IBEX ended down 0.7 percent, after dropping as much as 1 percent.

Data from China also put a damper on risk appetite, showing economic growth cooled slightly to 6.8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared with the second quarter’s 6.9 percent.

Other data showed China’s industrial output rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in September, while retail sales also outperformed.

But property sales fell for the first time in over two years. In addition, People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan spoke of the risks of a “Minsky moment” in the economy, referring to a sudden collapse in asset prices sparked by debt or currency pressures.

U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 1.4 percent at $51.29 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.23, down 1.6 percent on the day, pressured by larger-than-expected product inventories in the United States and some profit-taking after a recent run-up in oil benchmarks.","Stocks end flat, U.S. Treasury yields fall after Powell report",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/stocks-end-flat-u-s-treasury-yields-fall-after-powell-report-idUKKBN1CO037

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process said on Thursday.

Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting “went well,” the source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list.

“I don’t think he’s leaning yet,” the source said.

Other contenders to lead the U.S. central bank are top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. [nL2N1MS2D8]

Powell, who is viewed as representing a continuation of Yellen’s gradualist approach to raising interest rates, along with Warsh, are seen as the top contenders.

Despite his time as Fed Governor under Chair Ben Bernanke, Warsh is seen as a less well-known nominee. He has criticized the Fed’s bond-buying program and advocated changes in its inflation target.

U.S. Treasury yields briefly renewed their drop late Thursday after Politico reported that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell for the job.

Trump leaves on Nov. 3 for a tour of Asia and is expected to announce his choice before that trip.

The president told reporters on Tuesday that he likes all five candidates. “I’ll make a decision over the next fairly short period of time,” Trump said.

Meanwhile, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Freedom Caucus mounted a campaign to kill any chance of a second term for Yellen, the latest sign conservative Republicans want a fresh face at the helm of the Fed, which sets U.S. monetary policy.

Representative Warren Davidson, a Republican on the House Financial Services Committee’s monetary policy panel, is among those who want a change. He is circulating a letter opposing Yellen’s reappointment, the Ohio congressman’s spokesman said.

“Davidson is very passionate about this process,” the spokesman said, adding that the lawmaker is particularly concerned about the impact Fed policy has had on the ability of small firms to raise operating funds.

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative Republican grouping in Congress, have been critical of Yellen, with some accusing her of keeping monetary policy too loose.

Key members of the House Financial Services Committee also have backed ideas proposed by contenders to replace Yellen. Taylor’s research, for example, figured prominently in a House-passed bill requiring the Fed to explain its actions through a strict set of rules.

The House, however, has no direct control over the appointment of a Fed chief. The Senate decides whether to confirm the president’s nominee.

Trump has criticized Yellen in the past and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington by naming new people to top jobs and embracing different ideas. But his economic agenda could benefit from the steady economic conditions fostered by Yellen’s Fed.

Cohn’s chances of getting the job were thought to have dimmed after he publicly criticized the president’s response to a white supremacist rally in Virginia.

But the top White House economic adviser, who is helping to lead the administration’s push for tax reform, has since gotten back into Trump’s good graces.","Trump concludes Fed chair interviews, could decide next week: source",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-concludes-fed-chair-interviews-could-decide-next-week-source-idUSKBN1CO2LI?il=0

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil producers are working to build consensus on extending their deal to reduce supplies, OPEC’s secretary general said on Thursday, with the potential for continuation throughout 2018 forming a basis for talks.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an attempt to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.

The deal has supported prices, which are trading within sight of a two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated and producers are considering extending the deal at their next meeting on Nov. 30.

OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo, in a briefing with reporters on Thursday, said that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion this month that the deal could be extended to the end of 2018 were being taken “seriously”.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, the OPEC president, and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak “are taking cue from the open statement of President Putin and engaging the rest of the participating countries ... to build consensus before Nov. 30”, Barkindo said.

Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.

Barkindo said it wasn’t yet clear if the decision would be made on Nov.30 and, asked whether another meeting could be held in early 2018, said that Falih and Novak would consult and decide.

“It’s difficult to say at the moment what will be decided in November,” Barkindo said.

“It will depend on a number of factors, chief among which is how far are we from achieving our objective of a convergence of supply and demand.”

Falih and Novak are also talking to producers not currently participating in the supply cut, Barkindo added.

BALANCED MARKET IN SIGHT

Earlier in the day Barkindo said the supply pact was helping to speed the balancing of the crude market.

“There is no doubt that this market is rebalancing at an accelerating pace,” he said in a speech at the Oil & Money conference in London.

“Stability is steadily returning and there is far more light at the end of the dark tunnel we have been travelling down for the past three years.”

Oil prices, trading above $57 on Thursday, are half their level of mid-2014, prompting energy companies to cut back on exploration and producers to curb production.

The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in OECD industrialised countries to their five-year average.

Stock levels in September were about 160 million barrels above that average, Barkindo said, down from January’s 340 million barrels above the five-year average.",OPEC seeking consensus on oil supply cut extension before meeting,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-barkindo/opec-seeking-consensus-on-oil-supply-cut-extension-before-meeting-idUSKBN1CO140

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA) on Thursday rejected U.S. proposals to increase North American content for autos produced in the region and require, under a new NAFTA deal, that half of all content come from the United States.

AMIA President Eduardo Solis said the rules of origin enshrined in the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have been key in creating value and integrating the auto industries of Canada, the United States and Mexico.

“Our position is to not touch the methodology or the rules of origin that have allowed this sector to be successful in the three countries,” Solis said at an event in Mexico City.

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed raising the amount of NAFTA content in autos to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.

Those demands to reserve the lion’s share of automotive manufacturing for the United States helped cast a pall over a fourth round of talks to revamp the 23-year-old accord underpinning $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.

Solis called the U.S. proposal for country-specific content rules unacceptable, saying it violated World Trade Organization rules.

The move is a shift in strategy for the world’s largest social network, which previously has tried to keep users within its own service, and may help restore its image by strengthening ties to respected news organizations after the spread of false news stories on Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

It may also help soothe relations with some publishers, which often see their articles widely shared among Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly users but have found it hard to translate Facebook readers into paying subscribers.

While publishers will own the data on users who buy a subscription, they will not have information on who reads the free articles on Facebook, a main point of contention for several publishers.

Under the trial, which includes the Boston Globe, Germany’s Bild and France’s Le Parisien, Facebook mobile users can read 10 articles under a publication’s paywall for free, or a selection of articles publishers allow access to, and will then be prompted to purchase a subscription on the publisher’s website for full access.

An executive at Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O), told Reuters Facebook’s one-size-fits-all testing model would be a step back from the Journal’s paywall strategy.

“Ten free articles is quite a lot,” said the executive, who requested anonymity. “It’s more about the data and around remaining in control of our membership strategy.”

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Barrick Gold will give Tanzania a 16 percent stake in three gold mines, a 50 percent share of revenues from those mines and a one-off payment of $300 million to resolve a dispute that has hit its operations in the country, the two sides said.

The Canadian miner and the Tanzanian government have been in talks for months after the east African country banned the export of unprocessed minerals and enacted laws to raise state ownership of the nation’s mines.

The agreement announced on Thursday comes after the new laws and a crackdown on mining firms slowed fresh investment in what has long been seen as one of Africa’s brightest mining prospects.

President John Magufuli, nicknamed the Bulldozer, has said the government’s approach was aimed at ending what he called years of corrupt practices and tax evasion that have robbed the country of revenue.

In March Tanzania banned the export of gold and cooper ore over a tax dispute with London-listed Acacia Mining , which is majority-owned by Barrick Gold. The ban was part of a push for the construction of a local smelter to make the country’s gold exports more valuable.

Magufuli did not say whether the export ban will be lifted. He said a working group comprising Barrick and government representatives would meet for more discussions.

“Now that we are all shareholders, we can sit down over a cup of coffee and amicably resolve any outstanding issues,” he said on television. “We trust Barrick, they are a true partner.”

The president also ordered government officials to immediately begin talks with other companies in diamond and tanzanite mining to achieve similar agreements.

Tanzania is the continent’s fourth-largest gold producer and Acacia is its largest miner, with three gold mines that also produce copper.

Barrick, the world’s largest gold miner, last week said it had experienced a decline in third-quarter gold production amid pressure from the Tanzanian government on Acacia.

Acacia shares were up 18 percent by 1200 GMT.

Barrick Chairman John Thornton told a news conference in the Tanzanian capital the deal would have to be approved by independent shareholders and directors of Acacia.

Tanzanian justice and constitutional affairs minister Palamagamba Kabudi said the agreement was in keeping with the mining laws passed in July.

“We have also agreed to have a 50:50 share of revenues between the government and Acacia Mining from all the mines,” he added.

There was previously no revenue-sharing agreement and the government’s take from mines was only from taxes and other royalties.",Barrick Gold to give Tanzania mines stake and $300 mln to end dispute,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CO1MJ-OZABS

The clashes broke out on Tuesday and Wednesday in Kajo Keji between two groups: one loyal to former army general Thomas Cirillo and one loyal to former vice president Riek Machar.

Kajo Keji is a key conduit for rebels moving east and west and an entry point for supplies from Uganda.

South Sudan’s civil war, triggered by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Machar, has plunged parts of the world’s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - about four million people - to flee their homes.

As the war burns on, battles are being fought on many fronts and armed groups have splintered and begun fighting each other.

The groups that clashed this week both oppose President Salva Kiir’s government and had previously been stationed side by side in Kajo Keji.

But SPLA-IO spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters that National Salvation Front forces attacked on Tuesday, killing two soldiers and capturing two others. Another SPLA-IO member said they had to withdraw troops from a battle with government troops nearby in order to fight off the attackers.

An NSF commander on the ground, John Kenyi Loburon, said SPLA-IO killed one of his men. He said his group captured “a few” rebels.

They are reducing screen time, blocking Facebook and restricting access. But in Advait Chandan’s “Secret Superstar”, the problem is the solution.

The internet offers heroine Insiya an escape route from a stifling life. The shadow of an abusive father and the domestic violence she sees every day loom over her. What keeps her going is her love for music - and her mother Najma. For all her submissive behaviour in front of her husband, Najma is a feisty woman - she fights for her daughter to have the freedom she herself never had. She lets Insiya go out with boys, pursue her music, and buys her a laptop with an internet connection.

Insiya might live in Vadodara, not one of India’s biggest cities, but the internet is a great leveller. She records a few videos on YouTube wearing a burqa - fearing her father will find out - and in the magical ways of Bollywood, turns into an internet sensation overnight. She has millions of page views, fan pages waiting for her posts, but at home, none of that matters because her father can wreak havoc at any time.

To his credit, director Chandan doesn’t shy away from depicting domestic violence. There are scenes that are difficult to watch and the reality of domestic abuse and its effects on children are portrayed with more sensitivity and realism than usual for a Bollywood film. The bond between Najma and Insiya is also one of the film’s highlights, as is the track between Insiya and Chintan (Tirth Sharma), her classmate who harbours a very obvious crush on her.

The problem with “Secret Superstar” is that it starts out with a good idea, but the film unravels because it wants to say too many things at once. Chandan seems determined that audiences should cry at every turn. Insiya and her journey to stardom are full of contrivances. Chandan isn’t bothered about authenticity or logic - he just wants to make sure those tears are flowing.

Aamir Khan appears as Shakti Kumarr, the rather obnoxious and self-obsessed music director who turns into an unlikely saviour for Insiya, but this film is not about him. It is about Insiya, and Zaira Wasim puts in an inspired performance that rides over the several bumps in the script. She shares a wonderful chemistry with Meher Vij, who plays Najma, and the two of them are the life of “Secret Superstar”. If only the film had shown as much restraint as they do, it might have been more deserving of “superstar” status.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.",'Anemic' iPhone 8 demand drags Apple shares lower,https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-iphone/anemic-iphone-8-demand-drags-apple-shares-lower-idINKBN1CO1J5?il=0

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - O Tribunal Regional Federal da Primeira Região concedeu nesta quinta-feira uma liminar que suspendeu os efeitos de uma decisão anterior que determinara o bloqueio de bens e valores de pessoas físicas e jurídicas ligadas à família Batista, que comanda a holding J&F, afirmou o advogado do grupo Ticiano Figueiredo.

A decisão anterior, que tinha entre os alvos os irmãos Joesley e Wesley Batista e alcançava a cifra de 1,6 bilhão de reais, apresentava como fundamento supostamente ressarcir prejuízos futuros referentes a operações do grupo com o Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES), investigadas pela operação Bullish, da Polícia Federal.

Na decisão, obtida pela Reuters, o desembargador Olindo Menezes afirmou que houve “flagrante afronta” à autoridade do tribunal na decisão da Justiça de primeira instância, porque se valeu de informações que não têm “registro processual válido”. Ricardo Leite tinha dado liminar ao se valer elementos da “mídia nacional” sobre uma suposta rescisão do acordo de delação premiada de executivos do grupo.

“Com a devida vênia, eventual alteração do quadro processual que importe o restabelecimento da determinação de constrição de bens dos requerentes deve ser submetida ao Tribunal, que, suspendendo a anterior decisão do juízo de primeiro grau, no particular, determinou a liberação dos bens”, afirmou Menezes.

O desembargador destacou ainda que a decisão anterior baseou-se um premissa “equivocada” porque, ao contrário do que havia sustentado o juiz de primeira instância, não se tem notícia de rescisão de acordo de delação premiada.

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, urged voters in New Jersey to reject the “politics of division” by supporting Democrats in next month’s state elections.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama said New Jersey could send a powerful signal about the type of politics it wants by voting for Democrat Phil Murphy in the Nov. 7 governor race.

“You’re going to send a message to the country and send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division, we are rejecting a politics of fear, that we are embracing a politics that says everybody counts,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark that chanted: “Four more years.”

It was the first of two public appearances by Obama on Thursday on behalf of Democratic candidates for governor. He will appear later in Richmond, Virginia. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding elections for governor this year.

Those contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can turn the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The two governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could be a preview of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Trump’s combative style and inflammatory comments have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

But in New Jersey, Obama focused on urging supporters to turn out their friends and families to vote. Democrats hope Obama can help bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

‘CAN‘T TAKE ELECTION FOR GRANTED’

Opinion polls show Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the New Jersey lieutenant governor, who is hindered by the unpopularity in the state of Trump and Republican Governor Chris Christie.

But Obama said no one should assume a victory is in the cards, making an indirect reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

“You can’t take this election or any election for granted. I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said.

Obama will appear on Thursday night in the political battleground of Virginia, which is viewed as a potential bellwether. Opinion polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

Lo ha detto lo stesso segretario del Pd durante la registrazione della trasmissione televisiva “Otto e mezzo”, precisando che il testo finale ha accolto le modifiche chieste dal presidente del Consiglio, Paolo Gentiloni.

Alla domanda su chi sapesse del governo, Renzi ha risposto: “Tecnicamente il viceministro [Pier Paolo] Baretta... tutti erano informati e ne hanno discusso”.

Al quesito più esplicito riguardante Gentiloni, ha replicato: “[Il premier] mi ha telefonato nel pomeriggio di martedì per sottolineare come la mozione avesse dei punti da cambiare ... l‘abbiamo cambiata”.

“Quello che decide Gentiloni avrà mio pieno sostegno e supporto”, ha chiarito Renzi, riferendosi alla nomina del prossimo governatore della Banca d‘Italia.

L‘ex premier ha poi aggiunto, riferendosi alla possibilità di un secondo mandato di Visco: “Se il governo lo vuole confermare...Ma davvero un partito come il Pd non ha il diritto di dire che qualcosa non ha funzionato?”

La mozione del Pd contro la riconferma del governatore in scadenza è stata appoggiata dal governo ma fortemente criticata dal Quirinale ed ha aperto in questi giorni uno scontro istituzionale.

La nomina del governatore è fatta dal presidente della Repubblica su proposta del premier, sentito il consiglio superiore di Bankitalia e con una deliberazione del Consiglio dei ministri. Il mandato di Visco scade a fine ottobre ed è rinnovabile per altri sei anni.

Nei giorni scorsi una fonte governativa ha detto che il presidente della Repubblica propende per una riconferma di Visco. E lo stesso capo dello Stato non ha nascosto la sua irritazione per la scelta del partito di Renzi.

Renzi ha detto che una conferma di Visco non sarebbe una sua sconfitta “perché non ho posto un tema legato a un nome e un cognome”.

OSLO (Reuters) - Governments should extend the protection of nature far beyond iconic creatures such as tigers and elephants to species including worms and beetles that are vital to human prosperity, the chair of a global scientific project said on Thursday.

“We are trying to ... put biodiversity and ecosystems on the same level - as an environmental, economic, social, security issue - as climate change,” Robert Watson told Reuters in a telephone interview.

“Biodiversity is absolutely central to human well-being” as the source of everything from food to medicines, said Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

More than 550 IPBES experts from more than 100 nations, in the most comprehensive review to date, will issue regional reports about the state of nature in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and Europe and Central Asia in March 2018.

They will also issue a report on land degradation and restoration in 2018, and a global summary of biodiversity in 2019, he said.

Man-made threats to nature include pollution, the clearance of forests to make way for farms and cities, invasive species in new habitats and rising temperatures caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Watson said people often think of charismatic species - such as lions, polar bears or orangutans - when they consider threats to the natural world. He said the reports would put a far wider spotlight on how ecosystems work.

And he said that less well-known creatures, such as worms or insects, are vital by helping to cycle nutrients in the soil.

“Some of the most important species aren’t very charismatic - like the dung beetle in the African plains,” Watson said.

“If you tell people ‘We need to save the dung beetle’ I think one’s going to get a pretty jaundiced look,” he said.

IPBES issued its first report last year, showing that bees and other pollinators are at risk from pesticides and disease.

It estimated that $235 billion to $577 billion of annual world food production at market prices, from coffee in Brazil to apples in China, depends on pollinators.

The IPBES reports would gauge the risks to natural systems, ranging from coral reefs to cloud forests.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid.
The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play.
The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.
From 2009-2011, he led the Department of Justice’s disability rights enforcement as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.","On September 7, on a straight party-line vote, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee moved forward a bill that would gut key protections for people with disabilities. Although versions of this legislation had been introduced in prior years, the bill did not go anywhere while President Barack Obama stood ready to veto it. But now that President Donald Trump, whose actions have demonstrated hostility to civil rights, occupies the White House, the proposal presents a real risk of passage. If Republicans in Congress do eviscerate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it will be the culmination of their recent abandonment of the bipartisan consensus in favor of inclusion and equality for disabled persons.

Although the partisan divide in Washington has often seemed unbridgeable, disability rights long united lawmakers. Republican President George H.W. Bush referred to the ADA, which he signed in 1990, as one of his “proudest achievements.” The law guaranteed that people with disabilities would have access to, and be free from discrimination by, employers, businesses, and government agencies. In 2008, after a series of court decisions that gave a narrow reading to the ADA, a Democratic Congress passed amendments to the ADA reasserting the statute’s broad coverage - and President George W. Bush signed it.

The Trump administration is hacking away at disability rights online and in the workplace, while Trump and congressional Republicans work to gut funding for programs people with disabilities rely on such as Medicaid. The partial ADA-repeal bill is only the most overt assault on disability rights - the culmination of a shift that began when, in December 2012, 38 Republican senators denied the two-thirds vote needed for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was modeled on the ADA and ardently supported by disabled GOP luminaries such as former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But while that action was merely symbolic red meat for their base – conservatives worried it would inhibit homeschooling and infringe U.S. sovereignty - this new proposal could cause tangible and long-lasting harm.

The current bill, misleadingly titled the “ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017,” would render largely unenforceable key ADA requirements that businesses be accessible to disabled consumers – requirements that they provide ramps instead of stairs where possible, that doorways be wide enough for wheelchairs and so forth.

For wheelchair users, a single step – or a door that is a bit too narrow – can be the barrier that prevents them from patronizing a store. A few inches can make the difference between being full participants in civic and economic life and being dependent on others and shut off from the community.

Businesses have had 27 years to learn about and conform to the ADA’s requirements. But too many still fail to comply with the law, because enforcement relies principally on suits by disabled individuals. Wheelchair users, blind persons, and other people with disabilities encounter inaccessible businesses on a daily basis. According to 2016 Department of Labor statistics, only 31.2 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities had jobs, compared to 76.4 percent of working-age nondisabled Americans. The failure of employers, including stores and restaurants, to provide required accommodations is one of the key reasons for this persistent gap. Surveys show inaccessibility also causes people with disabilities to eat out less often.

The ADA does not give a disabled customer the right to receive damages for a denial of service, just an injunction that requires the owner to remove the barrier. This limitation already creates an incentive for inaccessible businesses to wait until they are sued before complying. Under the bill that recently passed the judiciary committee, the incentive to wait and see will be even greater. The proposal would prevent a disabled person from suing a business that violates the ADA as long as the business makes “substantial progress in removing the barrier,” within six months of being notified. A business might be able to avoid ever complying with the ADA or facing a lawsuit. It’s a system designed to allow businesses to delay until the victim runs out of energy or money to keep pursuing them.

Sponsors of the “ADA Education and Reform Act,” such as Texas Republican Ted Poe, say that the bill is necessary to stop unscrupulous lawyers from bringing frivolous or abusive ADA cases against small businesses. But state bars, and individual judges, already have ample authority to sanction attorneys who engage in such unprofessional conduct. And the ADA itself protects the interests of business owners by providing that an existing facility need not remove accessibility barriers unless doing so is easy to accomplish without significant expense.

Rather than protecting legitimate business interests, the bill pending in Congress would give a reprieve to enterprises that have had 27 years to comply with the law but have not yet done so. That is a betrayal of the basic promise of the ADA – that people with disabilities would be treated as equal citizens, with full access to America’s civic and economic life.

It is just the latest Republican betrayal of the historic bipartisan support for disability rights. In the Trump administration, attacks on disability rights have accelerated. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department has already reversed course in a key lawsuit, prosecuted by the Obama administration, involving the rights of disabled workers to retain their jobs. The White House has also signaled a halt to the Obama-era efforts to adopt regulations ensuring that the Internet is accessible to blind people and others with disabilities.

Perhaps the biggest threat to disability rights isn’t even in the realm of civil rights law, but healthcare: the GOP’s endless efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut funding for Medicaid. If they succeed Republicans would remove benefits that allow people with disabilities to access health insurance and home health services. Instead of staying in their communities and possibly working, many would be institutionalized. Trump has also proposed in his budget to cut drastically into Social Security Disability Insurance, the only source of income for millions of Americans unable to work.

The bipartisan consensus favoring disability rights represented the best of America’s ideals of equality, opportunity, and fair play. The Republican Party’s turn against disability rights is a rejection of those core American values.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish officials said on Thursday thousands of their people had fled Kirkuk region fearing persecution since Iraqi armed forces retook it following a referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad.

The officials said roughly 100,000 people had gone, though that number could not be confirmed independently, and many Kurdish neighborhoods in Kirkuk city appeared to be operating normally.

The United Nations voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed, and urged Baghdad to stop any such abuses.

A mayor from the town of Khanaqin, Mohammed Mulla Hassan, said a Kurdish man was killed and six wounded by Iraqi security forces while protesting at the army’s takeover there.

Kurdish troops had left Khanaqin, near the border with Iran, on Tuesday to avoid clashing with advancing Iraqi forces.

Central government forces swept into Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic city of more than 1 million people and the hub of a major oil-producing area, largely unopposed on Monday after most Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew rather than fight.

Iraqi forces also took back control of Kirkuk oilfields, effectively halving the amount of output under the direct control of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in a serious blow to the Kurds’ independence quest.

Baghdad’s recovery of Kirkuk, situated just outside the KRG’s official boundaries on disputed land claimed by Kurds, ethnic Turkmen and Arabs, put the city’s Kurds in fear of attack by Shi‘ite Muslim paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, assisting government forces’ operations in the region.

Nawzad Hadi, governor of Erbil, the KRG capital, told reporters that around 18,000 families from Kirkuk and the town of Tuz Khurmato to the southeast had taken refuge in Erbil and Sulaimaniya, inside KRG territory. A Hadi aide told Reuters the total number of displaced people was about 100,000.

Hemin Hawrami, a top aide to KRG President Masoud Barzani, tweeted that people had fled “looting and sectarian oppression” inflicted by Popular Mobilisation militia.

U.N. relief officials said they had received allegations that 150 houses had been burned and 11 blown up in Tuz Khurmato and offices of Turkmen political parties in Kirkuk assaulted.

The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq issued a statement urging the Baghdad government “to take every action to halt any violations and ensure all civilians are protected and that the perpetrators of acts of violence, intimidation and forced displacement of civilians be brought to justice”.

Khanaqin, mainly populated by Kurds, also lies in a long contested territory just outside KRG boundaries.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Wednesday that security was being maintained in Kirkuk by local police backed by the elite Counter Terrorism Service, trained and equipped by the United States mainly to fight Islamic State militants. “All other armed group should not be allowed to stay,” Abadi said.

Sunni Muslim Kurds comprise the largest community in Kirkuk followed by Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslim Turkmen, Sunni Arabs and Christian Assyrians, according to the Iraqi Planning Ministry.

In another sign of rising tensions, Iraq’s Supreme Justice Council ordered the arrest of KRG Vice President Kosrat Rasul for allegedly saying Iraqi troops were “occupying forces” in Kirkuk.

Iran and Turkey joined the Baghdad government in condemning the Iraqi Kurds’ Sept. 25 referendum, worried it could worsen regional instability and conflict by spurring their own Kurdish populations to push for homelands. The Kurds’ long-time big power ally, the United States, also opposed the vote.

KURDISH LEADERS WELCOME ABADI OFFER OF TALKS

With the referendum having given Abadi a political opening to regain disputed territory and tilt the balance of power in his favor, the KRG cabinet on Thursday welcomed his call for talks to resolve the crisis.

Abadi had said on Tuesday he considered the referendum “a thing of the past”, and asked that the KRG cancel the outcome of the vote as a precondition for negotiations to begin.

In a statement, the KRG cabinet said, “It will not be possible to resolve the issues through military operations”.

It added: “(We have) asked the international community to help both sides start a dialogue to solve the outstanding issues based on the Iraqi constitution.”

KRG Peshmerga forces deployed into Kirkuk in 2014 when Iraqi government forces fell apart in the face of a lightning offensive by Islamic State insurgents, preventing the oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.

Iraqi armed forces also took control of Kurdish-held areas of Nineveh province north of Kirkuk, including the Mosul hydro-electric dam, after the Peshmerga pulled back.

Crude oil flows through the KRG pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have been disrupted by a gap between incoming and outgoing personnel since Baghdad’s retaking of Kirkuk.

An Iraqi oil ministry official in Baghdad said on Thursday that Iraq would not be able to restore Kirkuk’s oil output to levels before Sunday because of missing equipment at two fields.

The official accused the Kurdish authorities previously in control of Kirkuk of removing equipment at the Bai Hasan and Avana oil fields, northwest of the city.

If Spanish authorities hoped strong-arm tactics against the referendum independence for Catalonia would nip nationalist feeling in the bud, they will almost certainly be proved badly wrong. Sunday’s footage of violent police action against unarmed demonstrators may prove just the catalyst pro-independence groups wanted, handing Europe yet another crisis when it needed it least.

Ironically, the government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy would have done better to simply ignore the non-binding referendum. It was always likely to produce a vote for independence, if only because those who favored it were far more likely to vote. Broader opinion polls conducted before the weekend ballot never showed majority support for independence, and most estimates suggest it has been ebbing steadily since 2013 to around 40 percent.

The scale of the violence this weekend and the brutality of the national police attempts to stop the ballot – almost 900 injured, according to local authorities – has changed everything. While the referendum was expected to be a polarizing event, the Spanish authorities have now effectively guaranteed it will be seen as a defining moment not just for Catalonia but the country at large. It would be astounding if it did not yield a substantial spike in separatist feeling. In a single day, the Rajoy government may have taken what should have been a manageable issue and escalated it into an existential challenge for Spain.

Catalonia’s governor Carles Puigdemont could always have been hoping to declare independence in the aftermath of the ballot. The widely reported violence, however, delivers a degree of political legitimacy to that fact. That doesn’t mean Spain will necessarily fracture – but it does dramatically increase the chances of that happening in the longer run.

A Spanish break-up will have broad implications for a continent that has spent much of the last decade bouncing from crisis to crisis, but had been having a better year than many U.S. and British pundits had anticipated. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both bested far-right challenges in national elections, growth is improving in eurozone economies and the refugee crisis appears to have stabilized.

Events in Spain, however, are a stark reminder that almost every European country remains trapped in a slow-burning political crisis with an ever-growing chance of unusual, unorthodox and outright aggressive nationalist or radical politics eroding the center ground.

In France, the National Front is clearly poised to take advantage of the faltering popularity of Macron, who defeated far-right leader Marine LePen in May. In Germany, Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in a strong third in last week’s election, and is now in parliament for the first time. The festering sore of Brexit continues to raise a host of challenges for both the EU and Britain, while Greece, Italy and Spain continue to struggle economically despite strong broader European growth.

So far, European nations are struggling to work out what their position should be with Spain. For all the public criticism of what is clearly seen as an unnecessarily heavy-handed Spanish clampdown, few European leaders have been willing to criticize Rajoy in public. Behind closed doors, however, the message will almost certainly be that the weekend’s scenes cannot be repeated.

Spain is not the only European country with separatist regions, and that will certainly be little appetite for a wider upswing in the regional nationalism. Just as serious, however, is the way events in Spain reinvigorate the wider European narrative of crisis.

Already, the euro was trading slightly lower on Monday on the news. Russian broadcasters and social media feeds – always keen to jump on anything that undermines the European political mainstream – gave front-page coverage to the news of riot police using rubber bullets and batons to stop the Catalonia vote. Wider international attention can be expected to continue, potentially exacerbating political polarization at every step.

Rajoy’s government is in a tricky situation. It must realize that more heavy-handed use of law enforcement will simply strengthen the separatist cause. Unlike more authoritarian states, Spain does not have the option of bludgeoning dissent into the ground. But nor can it afford to ignore events in Catalonia, for fear the now-heightened momentum behind the pro-independence movement grows still further.

The most obvious solution would be to offer Catalonians more regional autonomy. So far, however, there are few signs of that – and Rajoy’s early statements praising the police response and denying that the referendum has any legal force look set to aggravate tensions rather than ameliorate them.",Commentary: Spain's missteps supercharge the Catalonia crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-catalonia-commentary/commentary-spains-missteps-supercharge-the-catalonia-crisis-idUSKCN1C724O

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin launched one of his most stinging critiques of U.S. foreign policy on Thursday, listing what he called some of the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.

He declined to say if he would run for a fourth presidential term in an election set for March, though he is expected to stand after dominating Russian politics for 18 years.

Instead, he used a high-profile televised discussion with foreign academics in southern Russia to reach back to what he regards as the darkest days of U.S.-Russia relations.

Opinion polls suggest that harsh rhetoric towards the West plays well with many Russian voters, who credit Putin for restoring national pride and standing up to what they see as Western encroachment.

Asked by a Germany-based academic to identify what mistakes Moscow had made in its relations with the West, Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi:

“Our biggest mistake was that we trusted you too much. You interpreted our trust as weakness and you exploited that.”

Visibly angry at times, Putin cast Russia as the wronged party and its post-Soviet leadership as too naive and trusting.

“Unfortunately, our Western partners, having divided the USSR’s geopolitical legacy, were certain of their own incontestable righteousness having declared themselves the victors of the ‘Cold War,'” said Putin.

“They started to openly interfere in the sovereign affairs of countries and to export democracy in the same way as in their time the Soviet leadership tried to export the Socialist revolution to the whole world.”

Putin said U.S.-Russia relations were in a lamentable state, referencing an “unprecedented” anti-Russian campaign in the United States, the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities there and pressure on Russian media by U.S. authorities.

He did not single out U.S. President Donald Trump for personal criticism, but said Trump’s behavior was unpredictable as a result of political foes who were preventing him from fulfilling almost all of his policy pledges.

LITANY OF U.S. SLIGHTS

Putin said the United States was trying to squeeze Russia out of European energy markets with its latest batch of sanctions, which Trump grudgingly signed into law in August after Congress approved them.

“The recent sanctions package adopted by the U.S. Congress was openly designed to push Russia out of European energy markets and to force Europe to switch to more expensive liquefied natural gas from the United States, even though the volumes there are not yet sufficient,” he said.

He criticized Trump’s predecessors, describing how he believed the United States had betrayed Russia in the 1990s by not reciprocating what he called the unprecedented access Moscow gave Washington to Russia’s secret nuclear facilities.

He said the United States had flouted nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, saying Moscow had diligently complied with the same pacts only to be repeatedly let down by the United States.

His speech and ripostes in a punchy question and answer session that followed often sounded like a history lesson.

The United States had tried to stir up separatism in southern Russia in the 1990s, said Putin, something he said he knew for a fact from his stint leading the FSB spy agency.

The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and NATO’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia were bad, he said.

And in comments that could have been drawn straight from the pages of the Cold War, Putin accused the United States of upsetting the strategic nuclear balance by modernizing its arsenal of weapons.

Russia would develop new weapons systems, he pledged, if it was forced to, and if the United States withdrew from a landmark arms control treaty -- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- Russia would hit back fast.

“From our side, the response will be instant, and I want to warn, symmetrical,” said Putin.

(Reuters) - Protesters shouted “Go home Nazis” as a white nationalist gave a speech on Thursday at the University of Florida, where hundreds of police set up barricades and separated supporters and demonstrators to guard against violence.

Richard Spencer’s event at the university in Gainesville, which prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency to prepare for possible conflict, came about two months after rallies by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to a deadly clash with counter-protesters.

The violence on Aug. 12 added fuel to a national debate on race, and Republican President Donald Trump came under fire for blaming both sides for the melee.

White supremacists have been working to bring Spencer to various public universities, saying he has a constitutional right to free speech. The effort has forced college leaders to allow what they see as hate speech on campus and provide security to prevent violent clashes.

On Thursday, several hundred protesters shouting “We don’t want your Nazi hate” marched outside a campus performing arts center where Spencer spoke.

Two people were arrested, including a man hired as security for media for illegally carrying a firearm on campus, the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said. Another man wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with swastikas emerged from a crowd of protesters with a bloody lip.

“There were a few scuffles, but for the most part it was an extremely peaceful event,” said Chris Sims, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office.

Inside the venue, Spencer and protesters yelled at one another, and he criticized them for trying to suppress his speech.

“I’m not going home,” said Spencer, who heads the National Policy Institute, a nationalist think tank, and promoted the Charlottesville rally. “We are stronger than you and you all know it!”

He appeared to have few supporters in the crowd. About 15 white men, all dressed in white shirts and khaki pants, raised their hands when Spencer asked who identified with the alt-right, a loose grouping characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

Spencer left the campus soon after the event ended, university public safety officials said on Twitter. Police worked to separate those who attended the event as they left the venue from protesters gathered nearby.

One Spencer supporter appeared to have been sprayed in the face with an irritant. Police were not immediately available to speak about the incident.

Anais Edwards, 26, was inside the venue and supported those trying to disrupt Spencer.

“I’m really proud of how our community came together. Many of them were willing to stand up and not let him speak,” Edwards said.

The university said it did not invite Spencer to speak, but was obligated by law to allow the event. The school said it would spend more than $500,000 on security, and the National Policy Institute is paying more than $10,000 to rent the facility and for security within the venue.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors U.S. hate groups, said Spencer is “a radical white separatist whose goal is the establishment of a white ethno-state in North America.”

An outspoken supporter of Trump during the 2016 campaign, Spencer rose from relative obscurity after widely circulated videos showed some Trump supporters giving Nazi-style salutes to Spencer during a gathering in Washington to celebrate the Republican candidate’s win. Trump condemned the meeting.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs start voting on Friday in parliamentary election tipped to hand power to Andrej Babis, a rich businessman turned politician pledging to sweep out traditional parties, boost investment and keep out refugees.

The central European country has enjoyed fast economic growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but opinion polls nevertheless show strong voter support for Babis’s ANO movement and other protest parties.

Although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a big part in the campaign, with nearly all parties pledging to fight any attempts by the EU to force the Czechs to accept refugees distributed across the bloc.

The anti-immigration feelings follow similar trends in neighbouring countries. Parties opposed to immigration scored highly in elections in Germany last month and Austria last week, and have fed scepticism toward Europe across the EU.

The ANO movement, set up and tightly controlled by Babis, has won support from both the right and left with pledges to cut taxes and replace corrupt politicians, as well as calls to seal Europe’s borders and not accept a single refugee in the country.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government together with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s center-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

The leader of ANO party Andrej Babis arrives for a live broadcast of a debate before the country's parliamentary election in Prague, Czech Republic October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Milan Kammermayer

Final surveys before a polling blackout since Tuesday gave ANO, which means “Yes” in Czech, about 25-27 percent support, although indicating a slightly declining trend.

The election outcome may be a coalition similar to the outgoing one with ANO at the helm, which would mean no big change in the country’s foreign policy of balancing close ties with Poland and Hungary with pragmatic relations with other EU partners like Germany, the main foreign investor and export market.

“I would not expect an earthquake. ..The most likely option is the three-strong coalition that has been there. These parties have not ruled out working with ANO,” said Martin Mejstrik, political scientist at Prague’s Charles University.

The prospects for a deal with ANO’s current partners or center-right parties may run up against their demands that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because he faces police charges of fraud in drawing a 2 million euro subsidy for a conference center a decade ago. He denies any wrongdoing.

There is an outside chance that Babis may form a minority government supported by the Communists and the far-right anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy Party (SPD) that jumped in final opinion polls.

Analysts see such a tie-up as unlikely. It would be negative for the markets and would pose questions over future policies toward the EU. Babis opposes adopting the euro any time soon but does not seek to leave the European Union.

La CGT avait annoncé la semaine dernière la tenue d‘une nouvelle journée de manifestation contre les ordonnances sans être parvenue à convaincre FO et la CFE-CGC, des syndicats pourtant prêts à rejoindre le mouvement de contestation, à se mobiliser sur le plan confédéral.

Elle a compté toutefois, encore cette fois-ci, sur le soutien de Solidaires, de la FSU, du syndicat étudiant Unef, ainsi que de 13 fédérations de la CFE-CGC.

“Des dizaine de milliers” de personnes, selon la CGT, qui n‘a pas donné de chiffre précis, ont défilé.

Le ministère de l‘Intérieur a recensé 37.700 manifestants dans le pays contre 132.000 le 21 septembre et 223.000 le 12 septembre.

Ils étaient 5.500 à Paris, soit 11.000 de moins que le 21 septembre. La CGT a fait état de 25.000 personnes.

Le cortège a défilé dans le calme mais un groupe d’une trentaine de personnes cagoulées à la tête du cortège a commis des dégradations le long du parcours, a précisé la préfecture dans un communiqué. Une personne a été interpellée et placée en garde à vue pour transport de substances ou produits incendiaires.

A Marseille, où le secrétaire général de la CGT Philippe Martinez a défilé, la centrale a dénombré 20.000 participants et la police 3.000. Le syndicat en avait recensé le double le 21 septembre.

Déjà, le 12 septembre, le directeur de recherche associé au Cevipof de Sciences Po, Guy Groux, avait qualifié la mobilisation de “marée basse” par rapport aux mouvements de foule de 2010 au moment de la réforme des retraites.

Pour Raymond Soubie, consultant en stratégie sociale et ancien conseiller de Nicolas Sarkozy, “il s‘agit d‘une manifestation d‘homme d‘honneur”.

“UNE JOURNÉE TREMPLIN”

“C‘est la volonté de la CGT de maintenir la pression. Elle veut montrer qu‘elle est à la pointe des combats. Elle ne se fait pas d‘illusions sur l‘impact de la manifestation car les ordonnances ont été publiées”, a-t-il dit à Reuters.

Même discours du côté de Jean Grosset, directeur de l‘Observatoire du dialogue social de la Fondation Jean Jaurès et questeur au Conseil économique social et environnemental (CESE).

“La CGT a dit qu‘elle s‘opposerait aux ordonnances dès le début. Elle est cohérente avec son image. Elle n‘est pas aussi frileuse que d‘autres organisations sur l‘impact d‘une faible participation”, a-t-il dit à Reuters.

Pour la CGT, il s‘agit de créer un mouvement qui s‘inscrit dans la durée. “C‘est une journée tremplin”, a dit le secrétaire confédéral de la CGT, Fabrice Angéï, dans le cortège parisien.

“Il y aura d‘autres journées qui feront converger différents types de professionnels, au mois de novembre notamment”.

Les organisations syndicales doivent se retrouver pour une intersyndicale le 24 octobre prochain afin de discuter des réformes à venir et éventuellement fixer une date pour une journée d‘action en commun à la mi-novembre.

La dernière rencontre sur le sujet, le 9 octobre, s‘était soldée par un échec, ce qui avait incité la CGT à proposer la nouvelle journée de manifestation.

La CGT ne voudrait pas non plus, selon Raymond Soubie, laisser à Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader de La France insoumise (LFI), “le soin de mener lui-même des mouvements sociaux”.

Le chef du parti d‘opposition, qui a organisé des manifestations le 23 septembre et des “casserolades” le 30 contre la réforme du Code du travail, a qualifié lundi dans son blog la rencontre intersyndicale de “décevante”, et le milieu syndical de “‘vieux monde’ impuissant à vouloir et à changer quoi que ce soit”.

SHANGHAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - China’s leaders seem to have made peace with the old economic model. More lending, roaring exports and higher property prices helped push up output by 6.8 percent in the third quarter. For all the talk of innovation, restructuring and deleveraging, the fundamentals driving the world’s second-largest economy have not changed. China still depends on investment more than consumption, manufacturing over services, and cheaper products rather than stronger brands. For better or worse, Beijing looks okay with that.

In the three months to September, China’s bureaucracy mobilised to do what it does best: produce a rosy backdrop to a big meeting. The statistical result of their efforts landed during the 19th Party Congress, the day after President Xi Jinping trotted out the usual platitudes about territorial integrity and market forces.

Those forces certainly have been cooperative. Housing investment, China’s most critical single contributor to demand, remained healthy. Combined with infrastructure spending, it propped up state-owned cement producers, steelmakers and so on. This in turn drove demand for commodities, which pushed up producer prices, benefiting all sorts of other indicators - profitability in state-owned heavy industries, for example.

The private sector isn’t complaining. Trade remains robust. Exports far outstripped imports, suggesting the government’s de-facto import substitution initiative, also known as “Made in China 2025”, is gaining traction. A rally in the yuan has deterred capital outflows without denting exports - another sign that Chinese firms are moving up the value chain.

Yet there is sparse evidence of a statistically significant move from manufacturing into services. And the country remains highly dependent on debt. It’s true the government has allowed some state-owned firms to default, and suppressed the more dangerous classes of shadow banking. But total credit creation has barely slowed, hitting $274 billion in September.

Sure, easy liquidity has stimulated sexy entrepreneurship, spawning startups that enable sharing of everything from bicycles to basketballs. But these are macroeconomic blips, and have yet to show that they can earn a return on venture capital.

It’s politically expedient to present tweaks as revolutions. There are mounting challenges as distortions endure. But China’s old model, however unbalanced, is still easier for this crew to manage than a disruptive new one.",Breakingviews - China’s leaders make peace with its old economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-leaders-make-peace-with-its-old-economy-idUSKBN1CO0B9

LONDON (Reuters) - For years the options market that companies and investors use to hedge against big swings in currencies viewed the euro as a bigger political and structural risk than Britain’s pound.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian energy major Rosneft has agreed to take control of the main oil pipeline in Iraq’s Kurdistan, further boosting its role as the main international investor in the semi-autonomous region.

The move is an apparent part of a broader strategy by President Vladimir Putin to ratchet up Moscow’s political and economic influence in the Middle East. It came amid the crisis in Kurdistan’s relations with the central government in Baghdad, which erupted after the region held an independence referendum last month.

Rosneft said its share in the project may total as much as 60 percent, while the current pipeline operator KAR Group will retain 40 percent.

Sources familiar with the deal said Rosneft’s investment in the project was seen totaling about $1.8 billion.

The deal comes days after Baghdad threatened to re-route a big chunk of oil flows toward an old oil pipeline, which has been out of operation for several years since Kurdistan built its own infrastructure to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.

The main lifters of the oil there are trading houses Vitol, Petraco, Glencore and most recently Rosneft via pre-financing deals.

Rosneft’s influential Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said on Thursday that Kurshish authorities and Baghdad have to resolve their differences by themselves.

Iraq, along with neighboring Iran and Turkey, has pledged to isolate Kurdistan in the wake of last month’s referendum. That includes cutting off air and banking ties and reviving an old pipeline to Turkey to deprive Erbil of a big chunk of oil revenues.

Rosneft will be investing in expanding Erbil’s independent pipeline, which Baghdad has targeted, hoping to boost its capacity by a third to 950,000 barrels per day. That is the equivalent of about 1 percent of total global supply.

With Rosneft acquiring 60 percent in the project, the Kremlin oil major effectively becomes a controlling stakeholder in Kurdish oil infrastructure. That should give Erbil some sense of security as it faces unprecedented pressure from its neighbors.

Rosneft has already agreed to invest $400 million in five oil blocks in Iraqi Kurdistan.

It also had previously loaned Kurdistan $1.2 billion, guaranteed by oil sales, and is seeking to help Erbil build two major oil and gas pipelines.",Russia's Rosneft to take control of Kurdish oil pipeline amid crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-kurdistan-rosneft-pipeline/russias-rosneft-to-take-control-of-kurdish-oil-pipeline-amid-crisis-idINKBN1CO38H?il=0

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Thursday as financial and industrial shares climbed, while lower oil prices weighed on energy stocks.

Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), the country’s biggest bank by market capitalization, added 0.8 percent to C$100.82, while the overall financials group gained 0.5 percent. The group has soared more than 9 percent since early September.

“It is really incredible how dramatically they have snapped up in the last month or so,” said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management. “It’s saying there is confidence that the banks are going to report strong earnings.”

Canadian banks will begin reporting fourth quarter earnings next month.

Investors will also key off a Bank of Canada interest rate decision next week. After rate hikes in July and September, the first in nearly seven years, the market is expecting the central bank to pause.

“If they do hold ... it is a green light for the market, because it means the Bank of Canada isn’t going to be overly hawkish,” Teich said.

Higher interest rates tends to raise margins for banks but it could also add to a slowdown in the previously red-hot housing market which investors worry could slow loan growth.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index .GSPTSE closed up 35.84 points, or 0.23 percent, at 15,818.00.

Five of the index’s 10 main groups ended higher.

It included a 0.6 percent rise in industrial shares, led by Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO), which rose 1.6 percent to C$102.64.

The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, gained 0.4 percent.

The price of gold rebounded from one-week lows as a rally in equities and the U.S. dollar lost some momentum.

But copper prices fell for a third straight day as investors took profits after prices rallied above $7,000 a tonne for the first time since September 2014 earlier this week, and after data showed economic growth in China was in line was expectations.

Rogers Communications Inc (RCIb.TO) was among the biggest drags on the index, sliding 1.2 percent to C$66.05 as it signed up fewer internet customers than expected. The decline also comes after shares have rallied more than 6 percent over the last three weeks.

The energy group retreated 0.5 percent as the price of oil fell, with Encana Corp (ECA.TO) down 2.0 percent to C$14.40. U.S. crude CLc1 prices settled 1.4 percent lower at $51.29 a barrel.","TSX grinds higher as banks lift, energy retreats",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CO1KY-OCABS

The move is a shift in strategy for the world’s largest social network, which previously has tried to keep users within its own service, and may help restore its image by strengthening ties to respected news organizations after the spread of false news stories on Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

It may also help soothe relations with some publishers, which often see their articles widely shared among Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly users but have found it hard to translate Facebook readers into paying subscribers.

While publishers will own the data on users who buy a subscription, they will not have information on who reads the free articles on Facebook, a main point of contention for several publishers.

Under the trial, which includes the Boston Globe, Germany’s Bild and France’s Le Parisien, Facebook mobile users can read 10 articles under a publication’s paywall for free, or a selection of articles publishers allow access to, and will then be prompted to purchase a subscription on the publisher’s website for full access.

Facebook will not take a cut of the revenue from any subscriptions purchased, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.

Several major publishers have decided not to take part, largely because Facebook will not give access to reader data until they purchase a subscription.

An executive at Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O), told Reuters Facebook’s one-size-fits-all testing model would be a step back from the Journal’s paywall strategy.

“Ten free articles is quite a lot,” said the executive, who requested anonymity. “It’s more about the data and around remaining in control of our membership strategy.”

Britain’s Financial Times will not participate either, a source familiar with the matter said. The newspaper, which also charges for access to its articles online, wanted a registration process to get hold of reader data in exchange for free articles, said the source.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

Omar Khalid Khorasani’s death comes ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit and is likely to help ease tensions between the often-wary allies, as Islamabad has been asking Washington to target militants who attack inside Pakistan and hide over the border in Afghanistan.

Khorasani’s Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, is one of dozens of armed Islamist factions - including al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban - operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

But JuA has been particularly deadly in Pakistan, claiming responsibility for eight major attacks in two years.

Among them was last year’s Easter Sunday bombing in a park that killed at least 70 people, including 29 children, in the eastern city of Lahore.

The group also said it carried out a suicide attack at a hospital that killed at least 74 people in the southwestern city of Quetta, a bombing also claimed by Islamic State, with which JuA also has been affiliated.

Rumours had flown for two days that Khorasani had been wounded in U.S. drone strikes along the Afghan-Pakistani border, and on Thursday his group confirmed he had died.

“Our leader, Omar Khalid Khorasani, was wounded in one of the recent drone strikes in Afghanistan. He was wounded badly, and today he was martyred,” JuA spokesman Asad Mansur said by telephone.

The announcement came a week after Pakistan’s army rescued a kidnapped American couple and their three children from the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban faction that Washington has long accused Islamabad of failing to target.

The killing of Khorasani is likely to add to the recently improved mood between Washington and Islamabad, said Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and prominent political analyst.

“He was a very powerful leader and he had done great harm to Pakistan,” Masood said of Khorasani. “I think Pakistan has been looking forward to this, and I think the Americans targeting him has been very helpful in that sense.”

Khorasani had a background that reads like a history of Pakistani militancy.

Born Abdul Wali in a village called Lakaro in the northwestern Mohmand tribal region, Khorasani started out as an anti-India jihadist fighting in Kashmir, according to a long-time friend who spoke last year to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

He later joined the Pakistani Taliban in 2007 to fight the government to establish strict sharia Islamic law.

In 2014, Khorasani left the Pakistani Taliban after a leadership quarrel to form Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.

JuA gained attention in September 2014 when it announced it was supporting Islamic State and rejecting the main Pakistani Taliban leadership.

By March 2015, however, the group was again swearing loyalty to the main Pakistani Taliban umbrella leadership.

Still, JuA never specifically disavowed Islamic State either, and several attacks inside Pakistan have been claimed by both groups.

The United States last year designated JuA as a terrorist group.

In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 a.m. deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence.

The war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest, cut growth prospects for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and rattled the euro.

“If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,” Puigdemont said.

Catalonia, which has a distinctive culture and language, triggered Spain’s biggest political crisis for decades with a secession bid it put to a referendum on Oct 1. Only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede, while opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The European Union declined to help mediate, saying the crisis was for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

“Member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation,” European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference during an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly. Some pro-independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the Catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character.

Rajoy plans to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 constitution, which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law.

A senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on Saturday and probably voted through the upper house Senate on Oct. 30, giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before Madrid takes control.

The regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally, call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate, or back down, although this is seen as highly unlikely.

“From the moment the measures are known, the regional government knows what’s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon,” the source said.

Spanish stocks, bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade, but recovered, a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that Madrid had the upper hand in the standoff.

LAW UNCLEAR

The terms of Article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region.

“The government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order, recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating,” government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said in a statement.

Rajoy’s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps. A spokesman for the Socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist Article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way.

Madrid’s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers, to a softer and more targeted approach, the government source said. Theoretically, the central administration could take control of the region’s finances and police, and call a snap election.

But some members of the Catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution, suggesting the stand-off could extend for at least several more days.

Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP party whose 10 deputies are vital to Puigdemont’s coalition, said dialogue with the Spanish state now looked impossible, and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence.

“From our point of view, the sooner this happens the better,” Riera told Reuters in the Catalan capital Barcelona.

Impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city. Merche, 55, who voted for secession in the referendum, said she was tired of the political to-and-fro.

“People want a resolution. Go for one thing or the other, but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work,” she said, rearranging lettuces on her market stall.

Puigdemont has already defied Rajoy once this week, when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks.

Rajoy says the Catalan government has repeatedly broken the law, including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, only to suspend it seconds later.

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

Verizon has struggled to fend off smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) in a mature market for wireless service.

AT&T Inc (T.N), its No. 2 competitor, plans to diversify its revenues with an $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), a deal that, if approved by regulators, would give it ownership of premium content like HBO.

Verizon maintains it does not need to do a large content acquisition. “Just through licensing content, we can have access to content that we want to distribute to our customers,” Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said in an interview.

He said Verizon was continuing to work on a deal for content rights referenced by Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam at an investor conference in September but declined to comment on the type of content or partner.

Verizon said that it added 274,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis. Churn, or rate of defections for all customers paying a monthly bill, including tablet subscribers, was 0.97 percent.

Wells Fargo analysts had expected subscriber additions of 185,000 and churn of 1.05 percent. They said in an earlier note that the quarter was relatively less competitive, with consumers pushing out decisions to switch carriers until the fourth quarter when Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone X is expected to debut. New phone launches typically give customers incentive to upgrade plans and change service providers.

Verizon also said it lost 18,000 video subscribers in the third quarter, citing a shift from traditional pay-TV packages to cheaper streaming services. Other companies have pointed to the trend, saying it contributed to a more competitive environment during the period.

Revenues in its Oath media business, which includes AOL and Yahoo, were $2 billion in the first full quarter to include both internet businesses.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Since two massive earthquakes hit Mexico in September, claiming more than 460 lives, an early warning start-up called SkyAlert has doubled its users to 5.8 million, making it one of the country’s most downloaded apps.

SkyAlert has also found a market selling alarms to small businesses in the capital, said its co-founder and director Alvaro Velasco. And it is looking to expand to Latin America, mainly Colombia, Peru and Chile, which lack an official alerting system despite frequent quakes in those countries.

Velasco said that he and SkyAlert co-founder Alejandro Cantú are talking to investors from Mexico and elsewhere about raising 100 million pesos ($5.35 million) in capitalization in 2018.

He said the surge in users after the most recent deadly quake in Mexico City had heightened the interest of existing investors including U.S.-based American Messaging and attracted interest from two Mexico-based private equity funds.

American Messaging did not respond to requests to comment on any potential new investment.

Velasco said SkyAlert was in talks with those funds and existing investors to inject around 20 million pesos (1.05 million dollars) into SkyAlert.

Still, finding a sustainable business model for the quake monitoring app has been a challenge partly because recent regulation in Mexico City has limited SkyAlert’s ability to access funds through public financing.

MAKING A PROFIT NOT EASY

Shomit Ghose at Onset Ventures, a U.S. private equity company with experience in software start-ups, said quake apps have struggled to get adequate financing because of the lack of a clear path to profits.

“If the business model is B2B where the earthquake early-warning is sent to companies, or railways, or hospitals, or high-buildings then perhaps a strong B2B case can be made for start-up investment,” Ghose said.

SkyAlert’s predicament echoes that of companies seeking funding to develop earthquake alert apps in the United States. Seismic activity is hard to monetize without government support.

It competes with its former partner, Mexico’s official alerting system run by government-funded non profit CIRES, which was created after an earthquake in 1985 killed thousands in the country.

One of the world’s few widely deployed seismic alarms, CIRES runs a network of sirens positioned around Mexico City that warn of a coming quake. SkyAlert mainly warns people through a mobile app.

Both sell quake warning systems, but a 2016 regulatory reform requires public buildings in Mexico City to purchase alarm systems from CIRES, limiting SkyAlert’s public financing.

SkyAlert initially replicated CIRES’ alerts, but in 2015 it decided to deploy its own detection sensors to increase coverage with greater accuracy, Velasco said.

Slideshow (10 Images)

“After a few false alerts from CIRES that affected SkyAlert’s credibility, we decided to invest in our own technology,” he said.

SkyAlert also is exploring ways to monetize its free app.

Currently, it sells a “premium” version for $4 a year that allows users to personalize alerts. However, Mexico has an average per capita income of $8,200, and the company said only around 4 percent of users pay for it.

Velasco said SkyAlert’s revenue is split fairly evenly between those fees and income from selling to businesses.

The newest version of the app allows for paid advertising, but ads would not be visible during a seismic alert.

SkyAlert, founded in 2011, has few peers, but one similar service in Japan is called YureKuru Call, which relies on government seismic data. YureKuru has received some government funding on an ad-hoc basis, but like SkyAlert is mostly funded by fees, said Rina Suzuki, an official at RC Solution Co., the Tokyo-based firm that developed YureKuru.

Detection technologies are evolving and they are all perfectible, Jennifer Strauss, external relations officer at the Berkeley Seismology Lab told Reuters.

“In the end, what matters is how effective they are at alerting people to save lives,” said Strauss.","After massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app",https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-quake-app/after-massive-quakes-millions-in-mexico-turn-to-early-warning-app-idINKBN1CO35V

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Some of China’s top oil refineries are having to take the highly unusual step of cutting operations during what is typically the peak demand summer season when hot weather drives up power usage and families take to the road during school holidays.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on Thursday in a New York speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of President Donald Trump.

Bush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow Republican’s nine-month White House tenure. He did not mention Trump by name.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” Bush said at the Bush Institute’s National Forum on Freedom, Free Markets and Security.

Trump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “Crooked Hillary” for Democrat Hillary Clinton and, more recently, “Liddle” Bob Corker for a Republican senator who dared to challenge him.

Bush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that Trump has cracked down on while in office.

“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said.

“We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.”

Asked whether the speech was aimed at Trump, a spokesman for Bush said the long-planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years.

“The themes President Bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said Bush spokesman Freddy Ford.

Bush touted U.S. alliances abroad, something Trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused Trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year.

CRITICIZES RUSSIA

In the speech, Bush described a decline in public confidence in U.S. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs.

“Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said. “We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”

Trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that Democratic former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Obama, Trump’s predecessor, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii.

Bush said Americans were the heirs of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

“This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American,” he said. “It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”

Trump has had a rocky relationship with the Bush family. He belittled former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was an early opponent of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, and has criticized George W. Bush for the war in Iraq and for presiding over the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Bush said globalization could not be wished away “any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

He also had harsh words for Russia and seemed to take aim at Trump for playing down Moscow’s intervention in the U.S. election.

“According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy,” he said.

“Foreign aggressions, including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence, should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home.”","Bush takes veiled swipe at Trump, defends immigration and trade",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bush/bush-takes-veiled-swipe-at-trump-defends-immigration-and-trade-idUSKBN1CO2VG?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin launched one of his most stinging critiques of U.S. foreign policy on Thursday, listing what he called some of the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.

He declined to say if he would run for a fourth presidential term in an election set for March, though he is expected to stand after dominating Russian politics for 18 years.

Instead, he used a high-profile televised discussion with foreign academics in southern Russia to reach back to what he regards as the darkest days of U.S.-Russia relations.

Opinion polls suggest that harsh rhetoric towards the West plays well with many Russian voters, who credit Putin for restoring national pride and standing up to what they see as Western encroachment.

Asked by a Germany-based academic to identify what mistakes Moscow had made in its relations with the West, Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi:

“Our biggest mistake was that we trusted you too much. You interpreted our trust as weakness and you exploited that.”

Visibly angry at times, Putin cast Russia as the wronged party and its post-Soviet leadership as too naive and trusting.

“Unfortunately, our Western partners, having divided the USSR’s geopolitical legacy, were certain of their own incontestable righteousness having declared themselves the victors of the ‘Cold War,'” said Putin.

“They started to openly interfere in the sovereign affairs of countries and to export democracy in the same way as in their time the Soviet leadership tried to export the Socialist revolution to the whole world.”

Putin said U.S.-Russia relations were in a lamentable state, referencing an “unprecedented” anti-Russian campaign in the United States, the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities there and pressure on Russian media by U.S. authorities.

He did not single out U.S. President Donald Trump for personal criticism, but said Trump’s behavior was unpredictable as a result of political foes who were preventing him from fulfilling almost all of his policy pledges.

LITANY OF U.S. SLIGHTS

Putin said the United States was trying to squeeze Russia out of European energy markets with its latest batch of sanctions, which Trump grudgingly signed into law in August after Congress approved them.

“The recent sanctions package adopted by the U.S. Congress was openly designed to push Russia out of European energy markets and to force Europe to switch to more expensive liquefied natural gas from the United States, even though the volumes there are not yet sufficient,” he said.

He criticized Trump’s predecessors, describing how he believed the United States had betrayed Russia in the 1990s by not reciprocating what he called the unprecedented access Moscow gave Washington to Russia’s secret nuclear facilities.

He said the United States had flouted nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, saying Moscow had diligently complied with the same pacts only to be repeatedly let down by the United States.

His speech and ripostes in a punchy question and answer session that followed often sounded like a history lesson.

The United States had tried to stir up separatism in southern Russia in the 1990s, said Putin, something he said he knew for a fact from his stint leading the FSB spy agency.

The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and NATO’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia were bad, he said.

And in comments that could have been drawn straight from the pages of the Cold War, Putin accused the United States of upsetting the strategic nuclear balance by modernizing its arsenal of weapons.

Russia would develop new weapons systems, he pledged, if it was forced to, and if the United States withdrew from a landmark arms control treaty -- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- Russia would hit back fast.

“From our side, the response will be instant, and I want to warn, symmetrical,” said Putin.

But while money will unite leaders at this week’s European summit, it will divide them after Brexit.

The British government once hoped that the Oct. 19-20 meeting would be the moment when the Brexit negotiations could move on to discuss trade. That aspiration now seems hopeless. European leaders look set to insist on further delay until there is more progress in the first stage of talks, above all in reaching agreement on how much Britain will have to pay to settle its obligations when it leaves.

Political discord at the heart of the British government and the weakness of Theresa May following the loss of the Conservative majority in the general election have undoubtedly been hampering negotiations. Not unreasonably, European leaders worry about striking a deal with someone who might not be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU in 17 months’ time.

The EU holds the strongest cards because what matters most for Britain is its future trading arrangements with the huge market on its doorstep. The deadline under the Article 50 withdrawal procedure increases the EU’s leverage since Britain must leave with or without a deal in March 2019 (unless the 27 European states agree unanimously on an extension.) Despite hyped-up talk in London about preparing for no deal at all, Britain will do its utmost to avoid what would be a ruinous outcome, grounding flights to Europe and causing long hold-ups at border crossings, such as Dover on the south coast of England.

John Lloyd: We boomers are leaving a toxic legacy

If economic size and time favor the EU, the British government’s strongest card is money - one that it has played in various guises for centuries with its continental neighbors - and it is naturally reluctant to show its full hand too early. Even so May has already made an important concession. As part of the transition period of around two years that she called for in her emollient Florence speech last month, Britain would continue to pay in to the EU budget to ensure that none of the member states was out of pocket owing to the decision to leave. These net payments of around €10 billion ($11.8 billion) a year would fix the immediate problem facing the EU, the hole that would otherwise open up in its finances during the final two years of its current budgetary framework, which runs from 2014 to 2020.

But that extra money from aligning Britain’s effective date of departure with the end of the EU’s budgeting plan will not be enough, for two reasons. One is the way the EU in effect borrows from the future, by making spending commitments that it pays for later. In principle, the EU cannot borrow to pay for expenditure. But, through its accounting procedures, the EU can and does commit it to spending that will be paid for by future receipts from the member states.

What this means is that even after 2020 there will still be payments due on commitments made under the current seven-year spending plan. That pile of unpaid bills, eloquently called the reste ὰ liquider (the amount yet to be settled), is forecast to be €254 billion ($300 billion) at the end of 2020. Estimates of what Britain might owe towards this vary, but taking into account what might have been spent on British projects it could be around €20 billion ($23.6 billion).

On top of that – and the second main reason why the EU is holding out for more – the EU has liabilities, notably arising from the unfunded retirement benefits of European staff estimated at €67 billion ($79 billion) at the end of 2016, which it is expecting Britain to share. Even taking into account some potential offsets from its share of assets, Britain may face a bill of between €30 billion ($35 billion) and €40 billion ($47 billion) on top of the €20 billion ($23.6 billion) paid during the transition period.

Although money is Britain’s strongest card in the negotiations, there are political limits to the amount that the government can stump up. Brexit campaigners used inflated figures to exaggerate the money that could supposedly be switched into the health service from Britain’s contribution to the EU. That means the reality of having to pay a large exit bill could be electorally toxic. Yet in order to secure what really matters for Britain – access on reasonable terms to the huge European market – May’s government will have to confront the public with this cost.

The British predicament is so extreme and rifts between Conservative ministers over how much ground to concede so acute that a breakdown in the negotiations is conceivable later this year. With so much attention focused on the political drama playing out in London, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the EU will face a harsh budgetary future even with a substantial divorce settlement. Indeed the insistence that Britain pay up is a sign of the strains that will come to the fore after the transition period ends. The EU will lose one of its big net contributors, the second largest after Germany in 2015.

The EU’s budget of around 1 percent of GDP is in any case puny given the scale of its ambitions. Those hoping for greater generosity on the part of the remaining rich countries are likely to be disappointed. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened following her poor performance in the federal election, Germany will be even more tight-fisted than before in its efforts to avoid anything that smacks even faintly of a “transfer union.” Yet if the poorer countries receive less, that will sharpen the north-south divide that emerged so starkly during the euro crisis when countries such as Finland resented having to contribute to bailouts – especially to Greece – while southern states smarted at the imposition of austerity. And it will exacerbate tensions with eastern countries such as Poland that are big beneficiaries from the EU budget.

Both Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, and – more important – French President Emmanuel Macron, have recently set out plans to reboot Europe. But these grand visions will count for little unless they are matched by the solidarity of hard cash. At present the EU can make common cause in pursuit of Britain’s exit bill.

Helen Davies defended Lloyds’ actions during the takeover on the second day of a 14-week London trial in which about 6,000 investors are claiming more than 550 million pounds in damages.

They allege that the bank and five former directors, including ex-CEO Eric Daniels, withheld or concealed crucial information about HBOS’s financial position and breached their duties by recommending the purchase.

Lloyds, Britain’s largest retail bank, and the individual defendants deny any wrongdoing.

In her opening statement, Davies said a “veritable army” of professional advisers worked alongside and helped advise executives on the deal and that the lawsuit was based on hindsight and “a large number of myths or misconceptions”.

“The claimants’ case is fundamentally flawed at every level ... It is also legally unprecedented,” Davies told the court.

In a written filing submitted to the court, Wolfgang Berndt, the former head of Lloyds’ remuneration committee who retired in 2010, was quoted as saying at the time that “the proposed acquisition was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Lloyds”.

HBOS, formed from the merger in 2001 of former English building society Halifax and the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland, was close to collapse in 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers caused money markets to seize up, shutting funding avenues that HBOS needed for its ballooning loan book.

The government-brokered takeover of HBOS valued the bank at around 5.9 billion pounds. But as recession deepened in the wake of the credit crisis, Lloyds itself had to be rescued with a 20.5 billion pound government bailout in 2009.

Richard Hill, a lawyer for the claimants, has argued that executives failed to provide or seek proper financial analysis of the worst-case scenario of the “catastrophic” HBOS purchase, misleading shareholders, Lloyds’ board and accountants PwC.

Davies said Lloyds’ executives named in the case, who include former chairman Victor Blank, ex-finance director Tim Tookey, Helen Weir, the former head of retail and one-time head of wholesale banking Truett Tate, were highly distinguished and had no motive for acting against shareholders’ interests.

She said Lloyds’ board unanimously recommended the deal because it presented a rare chance for the bank to acquire HBOS without competition concerns and at a hefty discount to its underlying book value, which she put at 25 billion pounds.

At a London event hosted by Citigroup (C.N) on September 15, 2008, Blank had received what he interpreted as assurances from former Prime Minister Gordon Brown that competition concerns would be swept aside if the deal could be completed quickly.

The defence also disputed the claimants’ argument that Lloyds should have told its shareholders about a 10 billion pound loan it had extended to HBOS, as well as emergency support its rival was receiving from the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which peaked at about 25.6 billion pounds and $18 billion respectively.

Lawyers for Lloyds, which emerged from state ownership in May, argue that the allegations against the bank and its executives are “serious but unfounded”, that HBOS’s troubles were well known and that a majority of shareholders would have approved the deal even if there had been additional disclosures.

Edin Dzeko scored twice on his 100th appearance for Roma in an enthralling contest as the Italians stormed back from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 with 20 minutes remaining, only for Eden Hazard to salvage a point for Group C leaders Chelsea with a header.

The goal flow began in the 11th minute when David Luiz’s curler put Chelsea ahead and when Hazard doubled the home side’s advantage in the 36th, it looked like being a routine night for Antonio Conte’s side.

Aleksandar Kolarov fired Roma back into contention before the interval though and Dzeko’s double in the space of six minutes, the first a scorching volley, looked to have earned Roma only their second win in 16 attempts on English soil.

Hazard’s equaliser kept Chelsea top with seven points from three games with Roma on five -- three ahead of Atletico Madrid who were surprisingly held to a 0-0 draw by Qarabag.

“It is a good result for both teams but when you are 2-0 up at home you must win the game,” Hazard said.

“Now we have to play in Rome but we will try to win the game. After two defeats it’s not easy to bounce back.”

Chelsea, reeling from successive Premier League defeats, spent much of the first half on the back foot but were clinical when it mattered as they moved into a 2-0 lead.

The hosts went ahead when Luiz, playing in central midfield in place of the injured N‘Golo Kante, produced a stunning curler from 25 metres past Roma keeper Alisson Becker.

Radja Nainggolan and Diego Perotti wasted gilt-edged chances for Roma and those misses looked terminal for Roma’s hopes when Chelsea struck again with a 36th-minute counter-attack.

Alvaro Morata and Hazard combined before Morata’s cross spun off a Roma defender and into the path of Hazard who rammed home his side’s second.

Conte said he never felt his side were “in control” and the tide began to turn Roma’s way when Kolarov was allowed to burst into the area before firing a shot that nicked off Andreas Christensen on its way past Thibaut Courtois and into the net.

Roma began the second half full of purpose and Dzeko looked poised to tap-in Kolarov’s low cut back only to see the ball diverted off his toes by the alert Courtois.

A disgruntled Luiz was replaced by Pedro but Roma had taken a stranglehold and levelled in stunning fashion as Dzeko belted an unstoppable left-foot volley beyond Courtois.

Six minutes later Dzeko took his tally for the season to 12 goals in all competitions for club and country, the Bosnian hitman left unmarked to head in Kolarov’s free kick.

Roma’s lead lasted only four minutes though as Hazard glanced in Pedro’s cross with a superb header.

There was still time for both sides to win a classic encounter, the best falling to Dzeko who inexplicably headed wide from point blank range.

Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco praised his side’s character.

“We were two goals down after two individual mistakes but we had 70 percent of the ball in the first half,” he said. “We tried to win with the right mentality.”",Chelsea and Roma share spoils in six-goal thriller,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CO0UK-OZASP

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Thursday he will place his assets in a blind trust and divest all his stock in a publicly traded family business, amid opposition allegations that these holdings put him in a conflict of interest.

Questions about the assets of Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell, have dogged the minister and led some to question whether he would be forced to resign.

His plan to adopt a blind trust follow weeks of backlash over a government attempt to reform small business taxes, which have become a major stumbling block for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s two-year-old Liberal government.

Morneau said he had initially intended to put his assets in a blind trust - as Trudeau has - but had changed his mind after consultations with the ethics watchdog. He said he had “naively” believed that following the advice of the ethics commissioner was a high enough standard.

“What we’ve seen over the last week is that I need to do more. As minister of finance, in this role, it’s important to make sure people have absolute confidence,” he told a news conference, adding he has “about a million shares” in the company and would work with a trustee to divest his and his family’s holdings.

Shares of Morneau Shepell Inc fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday to C$20.63, shedding about C$21.6 million in market value.

Morneau was elected in 2015 when the left-leaning Liberals were vaulted to a surprise majority under Trudeau, becoming one of the many rookie ministers in Trudeau’s cabinet.

In a heated session of parliament after the news conference, opposition politicians said Morneau’s 2016 legislation on pension reform increased the profits of Morneau Shepell.

“The finance minister and his company, Morneau Shepell, have benefited from the minister’s actions,” said Conservative member of parliament Maxime Bernier.

Morneau said he had been pulled out of government meetings at least twice since becoming finance minister to guard against conflicts of interest between policy decisions and his company.

“I don’t know the total number of times, but I can remember at least two times being taken out of meetings because of that conflict-of-interest screen, I believe. Of course I don’t know what happened in those meetings,” he said.

Separately, Morneau said the government’s autumn fiscal update will be released on Oct. 24.","Canada finance minister says will adopt blind trust, divest assets",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CO2PA-OCADN

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday geared up to vote on an amendment that would block drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, with opponents of the measure saying development would lead to jobs and wealth creation.

Conservationists covet the reserve, also known as ANWR, in northern Alaska, home to tribes that hunt and fish and also a habitat for sensitive wildlife including caribou, polar bears and hundreds of species of migratory birds.

Many Republican senators hope to open a portion of the reserve called the 1002 area. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chair of the Senate energy committee and a Republican from Alaska, called this a “non wilderness area” because the federal government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration.

The budget instructs Murkowski’s committee to raise $1 billion over 10 years and she hopes some of that could come from opening the 1002 area. She urged senators to see the “instruction as an opportunity to do something constructive” and focus on boosting energy output from federal lands to bring new wealth.

Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy committee, introduced the amendment that would strike the instruction to raise the funds from energy production.

Republicans were attempting a “sneak attack” that would turn “public lands over to polluters”, she said. Senator Jeff Merkley, another Democrat, has said there is “something cynical and sad” about the effort top open ANWR because it would boost oil output from the state feeling the fastest effects of climate change, which a majority of scientists link to carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and development.

Democrats need a simple majority in the 100-member chamber to win. They hope that some Republicans, including Senators John McCain and Susan Collins, who have voted against drilling legislation in the past, will side with them.",U.S. Senate to vote on measure to block drilling in Arctic reserve,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-arctic/u-s-senate-to-vote-on-measure-to-block-drilling-in-arctic-reserve-idUSKBN1CO36H?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year’s election, introduced legislation on Thursday to extend rules governing political advertising on television, print and radio to also cover social media like Facebook Inc (FB.O).

Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner and Republican John McCain introduced the “Honest Ads Act,” one of the strongest efforts in Congress yet to address allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.

The legislation would expand existing election law covering television and radio outlets to apply to paid internet and digital advertisements on platforms like Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

“Our laws have failed to keep up with evolving technology and the capabilities of our foreign adversaries,” Klobuchar told a news conference.

The measure would also require digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly views to maintain a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by anyone spending more than $500.

And it would require online platforms to make “all reasonable efforts” to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not buying political advertisements to influence the U.S. electorate.

Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Representative Mike Coffman and Democrat Derek Kilmer.

Social media companies have become an increasing focus of congressional investigations into allegations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election on behalf of Republican candidate Donald Trump, something now-President Trump and Moscow deny.

Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, said $150,000 of ads paid for in rubles may be only the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of how many political advertisements were bought by foreign firms. He said advertisements could have been purchased using dollars, euros or pounds.

U.S. law bars foreigners from spending money to attempt to influence American elections.

Warner and Klobuchar acknowledged that the companies have resisted the legislation. But Warner said, “It’s our hope that the social media companies and platform companies will work with us.”

WILL IT PASS?

It was not immediately clear how much support the act would receive in Congress or when it might come up for a vote.

Social media companies have begun a lobbying campaign to at least influence, if not prevent, the bill.

The companies said they are open to working with Congress and have been turning over information, but are legally obligated to protect their users’ privacy. Facebook has turned over thousands of ads to congressional investigators and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, met with members of Congress last week.

Google said it was look at steps it could take on its various platforms and would work closely with Congress, the Federal Election Commission and the industry to come up with solutions.

“We support efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse,” Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in an emailed statement.

Klobuchar and Warner said it was possible the measure could be offered an amendment to another larger piece of legislation.

Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating the alleged Russian hacking and the possibility that Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow.

Klobuchar is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which helps oversee elections. And McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

They said they would like it to become law by early next year, well ahead of the November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, in which every seat in the 435-member House and about one third of the 100-seat Senate will be up for grabs

Many lawmakers and other U.S. officials have said they fear Russian efforts to meddle in those polls as well.

Separately, Facebook, Twitter and Google said Thursday they would send their general counsels to testify Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.

General counsel Colin Stretch will be the Facebook representative to testify before both committees, company spokesman Andy Stone said. The company’s high-profile Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sandberg will not appear.

A Twitter spokeswoman said Acting General Counsel Sean Edgett will represent the microblogging site. A Google spokeswoman said General Counsel Kent Walker would represent that company.","U.S. lawmakers want crackdown on Facebook, Twitter political ads",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-russia-facebook/u-s-lawmakers-want-crackdown-on-facebook-twitter-political-ads-idINKBN1CO259

Among many of us in the generations that have done well out of the post-World War Two period, there’s now a feeling of guilt - as there should be.

We need to feel guilty because the poisoned bequest we are leaving behind us stems from our own neglect. We can blame politicians, who are usually in the crosshairs when things go wrong. And some – not all – should take some of the rap. But the charge of neglect can’t come to rest only on them. The relative ease of living for post-war generations in affluent democracies has been the outcome of an implicit collective agreement not to disturb conditions in which living standards increased, choice widened, societies became more permissive, security was guaranteed by U.S. hegemony and state benefits became, mostly, more generous.

The list of our negative bequests is a melancholy and frightening one, usually put aside with a sigh and a passing frisson of dread. That frisson has lingered recently because one element in the legacy, security guaranteed by nuclear weapons, feels less secure given reports that North Korea is now developing nuclear missiles that can strike the United States and much of Europe - as well, of course, as the U.S. allies of South Korea and Japan.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the culprit here, but Donald Trump’s threat to wipe North Korea off the map has no obvious purpose except to apparently increase Kim’s determination to ramp up the threat.

Deterrence hasn’t worked and there seem to be few viable options. One plan, put forward by the legal scholar and former director of strategy in the National Security Council Philip Bobbitt, would persuade the Chinese to offer North Korea a “nuclear guarantee,” effectively extending Beijing’s nuclear defense to North Korea on condition the latter mothballed its own program. Encouraging a potentially hostile state to enlarge its nuclear capacity is a desperate measure, but one made thinkable by the futility or horror of the alternatives.

Nor is North Korea the only nuclear danger. In an alarming commentary, former U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry wrote that Russia is “well underway” in its nuclear rebuilding program and that the threat of nuclear catastrophe is greater than during the Cold War. “Our public is blissfully unaware of the new nuclear dangers they face,” he wrote.

Nuclear annihilation is the largest of the malignant possibilities we have failed to address. Government debt is less dramatic, but steadily narrows the future economic choices available. To give the citizens in countries covered by welfare states the ability to buy cars, engage in travel and indulge in other leisure pursuits along with the necessities of life, most Western states have taken on huge public debts. That of the United States topped $20 trillion for the first time earlier this year, about $170,000 for each taxpayer. So far, it can afford it: some countries with higher debt relative to GDP can’t. Italy has the highest level of debt in Europe after struggling Greece, and had its credit rating cut from BBB+ to BBB by the Fitch rating agency in April.

Wolfgang Schauble, the controversial outgoing German Finance Minister widely seen as the architect of austerity in the European Union, has warned that “the growth of public and private debt” constituted a very large risk – a fear echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde. The global economy is growing at present, but a collapse through debt could spark another recession, this time with even more serious social and political turbulence in its wake.

The world’s ecology gets no better, and may get worse – as President Trump announced a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change in June. The move, apparently unpopular with most Americans, including Republicans, is important not so much for the further ecological damage it will do (though it will do some) but as a sign to others that the nation which set itself as an example to follow of care for the environment is now one giving an entirely opposite message.

A study from MIT in August warned of “deadly heat waves” hitting India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, causing “devastation” within a few decades, if carbon emissions are not reduced. That would unleash a flight of refugees that would make the present one pale in comparison.

We’ve become used to learning of breakthroughs in the treatment of disease and chronic conditions, and the eradication, or substantial diminution, of feared diseases like polio. But new infectious diseases are erupting more frequently, spreading more quickly, and evading treatment more efficiently, raising fears of global pandemics starting in sprawling, overcrowded developing world cities, carried worldwide by aircraft. And another modern “plague” – obesity – the result of relative plenty, is rocketing upwards. A study in the medical journal The Lancet showed that among children worldwide, obesity has increased tenfold in the past four decades. Obesity in children and adults is now a major drag on health systems in rich and poor countries alike, prompting heart conditions, diabetes and diseases of the bones and joints.

These and other fundamental threats demand strong government responses, but governments, especially in democracies, are weaker. The Global Economic Forum reports that “there has been an erosion of trust in political institutions and processes” and that “there is a fundamental disconnect between citizens around the world and the elected officials that supposedly represent them.” In other words, the crises are growing as the effectiveness of governments shrinks.

If that sounds unduly pessimistic in the face of continuing advances in many fields, neglectful of the fact that bad stuff always happens but the world continues, then reflect on the triggers – the list could be expanded - whose pulling could precipitate disaster.

MADRID (Reuters) - The board of Abertis (ABE.MC) wants Atlantia (ATL.MI) to improve its offer for the Spanish toll road group although the Italians have the backing of a key shareholder in a takeover battle.

Trumping Atlantia’s bid, German builder Hochtief (HOTG.DE), controlled by Spain’s ACS (ACS.MC), made a 17.1 billion euro ($20 billion) offer for Abertis on Wednesday.

Atlantia’s bid, worth around 15.7 billion euros on a comparable basis, would create the world’s biggest toll-roads operator, helping both companies in their drive to branch out from their home markets.

Abertis said its board saw several “industrial and strategic” advantages in Atlantia’s offer but added that the price could be higher given the rival bid.

“The bigger size and a complementary geographical presence would make the new group more competitive, extending the average duration of concessions compared to Abertis’ current situation, strengthening the asset portfolio and boosting growth,” Abertis said in a statement on Thursday.

Atlantia CEO Giovanni Castellucci was quoted as saying in the Italian press on Thursday that the group would assess all options regarding possible changes to its bid.

Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, is offering 16.5 euros in cash or 0.697 Atlantia shares for every Abertis share.

Abertis said shareholder Criteria Caixa was ready “as of today” to take up Atlantia’s offer, accepting in exchange for its 15.08 percent stake shares in the Italian toll road operator.

LONG ROAD AHEAD

Banking foundation la Caixa is the biggest investor in Abertis through the 15 percent held by Criteria, which it manages, and another 7.2 percent holding owned by Inversiones Autopistas.

Also nine of Abertis’ 15 board members, including the chairman and the chief executive, favor Atlantia’s bid, the company said.

The Catalan group also said it was not planning to tender under Atlantia’s bid treasury shares worth 7.96 percent of its capital and added the board would give its opinion in due time over Hochtief’s bid.

Hochtief expects the takeover process to extend into next year, Chief Executive Marcelino Fernandez Verdes told staff in a memo.

“The submission of an Abertis offer is only the start,” he said.

Hochtief is offering 18.76 euros in cash, or 0.1281 Hochtief shares, for each Abertis share and has set a minimum acceptance threshold of 50 percent plus one share.",Abertis pushes Atlantia to improve bid after Hochtief move,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abertis-m-a/abertis-pushes-atlantia-to-improve-bid-after-hochtief-move-idUSKBN1CO0R7

TENSIONS EN ESPAGNE

Le gouvernement espagnol pourrait activer samedi l‘article 155 de la Constitution, qui permettra de suspendre l‘autonomie politique de la Catalogne, ont annoncé jeudi les services du président du gouvernement, Mariano Rajoy, à l‘expiration du second ultimatum lancé par Madrid à Barcelone.

Rajoy avait enjoint au président de la Généralité de Catalogne, Carles Puigdemont, de renoncer formellement à une proclamation unilatérale d‘indépendance. Dans sa réponse, le président du gouvernement autonome n‘apporte pas de clarification sur ce point et ajoute que le Parlement régional pourrait voter une déclaration formelle d‘indépendance si aucun dialogue ne s‘engageait avec le gouvernement central.

Ces évolutions auraient pu faire reculer l‘euro mais il grimpe au contraire de 0,5%, autour de 1,1845 dollar, les investisseurs accompagnant la baisse du rendement des Treasuries à 10 ans et anticipant l‘annonce dans une semaine par la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) d‘une réduction du volume de ses rachats d‘actifs.

One of the biggest so-called initial coin offerings to date, which raised some $230 million for a blockchain project called Tezos, has led to a spat between its architects and a Swiss foundation that controls the digital cash, according to a Reuters special report. Even in the world of crypto-currencies, traditional financial motivations apply.

ICOs, a hot financial trend with well over $2 billion raised this year, fall somewhere on the spectrum between crowd-funding and issuing non-voting shares. Participants contribute existing digital currencies like bitcoin and ether. Some may simply want to bankroll the project in question, but most hope to grab a slug of whatever new online coinage is on offer – in the Tezos case, “tezzies” – and to see it appreciate, as ether has done nearly 40-fold this year alone.

The creators of Tezos, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, got the fund-raising formula right. However, they set up a governance structure in which a legally independent Swiss foundation controls the digital cash raised. Now they are at loggerheads with its president, Johann Gevers, who told Reuters the couple were trying to control the foundation. They have accused him of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.”

The Breitmans stand to collect a portion of the proceeds – now in theory worth roughly double their original value – as Tezos project milestones trigger the foundation’s purchase of their company, Dynamic Ledger Solutions. Yet although it seems a sensible step in the experimental world of ICOs to incorporate checks on the use of the funds raised, the Swiss foundation may have been a method too vulnerable to human whims.

Meanwhile, China and South Korea have banned ICOs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed concerns. Project details can be very sketchy and it’s not always clear what contributors are entitled to receive. Kathleen Breitman likens the Tezos fundraising to making a donation and receiving a tote bag in return, but people interviewed by Reuters seem more like investors who are expecting returns.

The backstory is intriguing. The Breitmans met at a crypto-anarchist lunch. He, the son of a French playwright and actor, went on to work at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, while she later toiled at Ray Dalio’s secretive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. An early backer was Silicon Valley doyen Tim Draper.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

LORDSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Wall Street is fretting that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a downturn, but for thousands of workers at General Motors Co factories in the United States, the hard times are already here.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese officials on Thursday heaped praise on President Xi Jinping’s political ideology, unveiled a day earlier at a key Communist Party Congress, a sign that it could be enshrined in the party’s constitution and further cement his power.

Some ruling Communist Party officials were moved on Thursday to song, dance and tears in adulation of Xi, a day after he opened the twice-a-decade conclave pledging to build a prosperous “modern socialist country” for a “new era”.

Three outgoing members of the elite seven-man Politburo Standing Committee that Xi heads lauded “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

Such statements indicate that Xi could cement his power with his new eponymous slogan being incorporated into the party’s constitution. Whether the theory is included bearing his name will be a key measure of his status, analysts have said.

No other leader has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.

Xi is poised to begin a second five-year term next week.

Party officials hailed Xi as a wise and great “lingxiu”, or leader, a reverent honorific bestowed on only two others: Mao and his short-lived successor Hua Guofeng - another sign that Xi has accumulated more power than his immediate predecessors and could revive a party chairmanship as a precursor to staying on in some capacity beyond the end of his second term in 2022.

“Xi Jinping... has obtained the heartfelt love and respect of the entire party, army and people, he deserves to be called wise leader,” Beijing party secretary Cai Qi, a Xi ally and one-time colleague, said on Wednesday at a meeting of the city delegation, according to the official Beijing Daily.

Officials lavishing praise on the party’s top leader at a congress is not unusual, but overt displays of emotion or personal adulation are rare.

One female delegate from the southern province of Jiangxi broke into song to praise Xi’s treatment of ethnic minorities, while another from Guangdong province said that, listening to Xi’s speech, her eyes had brimmed with tears.

“I feel that the reason for my country’s accomplishments is fundamentally the helmsmanship of Xi Jinping,” said Jing Junhai, Beijing’s deputy party chief, invoking a phase often used to describe Mao.

The 64-year-old Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, tightening controls on civil society, revamping the military and asserting China’s rising might on the global stage.

Some party officials painted Xi as a saviour.

“Because of the Party Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping as its core, in five years, the party has been saved, the army has been saved, the country has been saved,” Liu Shiyu, head of China’s securities regulator, said on Thursday.

Others were more restrained.

Hu Chunhua, party chief in Guangdong province and a potential contender for a spot on the new Politburo Standing Committee to be revealed next week, simply referred to Xi as general secretary and did not mention his theory during an open session on Thursday, in contrast with more than a dozen other delegates who spoke. State media reported that he had praised Xi’s theory the day before.

NEW IDEOLOGY, MORE POWER

The exact meaning of Xi’s new banner term is not yet clear, although it is not unusual for Communist Party leaders to announce lofty slogans and then fill in the details as they go.

An ideology named after Xi to guide China and the party would further consolidate his power, said Ryan Manuel, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Hong Kong.

“This is a good umbrella for him to just keep saying whatever he wants and the system having to respond and study it,” he said.

Xi’s immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have had their ideological concepts enshrined in the constitution, but not their names.

The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, adding to speculation that Xi could retain power beyond a customary second term and even revive Mao’s chairman title.","With tears and song, China welcomes Xi as great, wise leader",https://in.reuters.com/article/china-congress/with-tears-and-song-china-welcomes-xi-as-great-wise-leader-idINKBN1CO0B3

The Sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable.

Sharif, 67, resigned in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.

Sharif said there was no precedent for indicting someone in his absence. “I hope I will get justice,” he told reporters in London in remarks broadcast by local Geo TV, adding that he would travel home to attend the next court hearing.

Judge Bashir Ahmad of the court that tries cases registered and investigated by an anti-graft body, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), indicted Sharif, his daughter Maryam Sharif and her husband, Muhammad Safdar. They all pleaded not guilty.

Maryam and Safdar were present in court, but Sharif, who was prime minister twice in the 1990s, sent a representative while he tends to his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment in Britain.

Maryam said in the court that the charges were unfounded and baseless.

“This will go down in history as a travesty of justice,” she said.

Muhammad Safdar, husband of Maryam Nawaz, daughter of ousted Pakistani premier Nawaz Sharif, waves from a a vehicle as he arrives at an accountability court in Islamabad, Pakistan October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood

Outside the court, Maryam again hinted at military interference in the judicial process by saying the trial was “a repeat of 1999”, the year her father was toppled in a military coup led by former army chief Pervez Musharraf.

It is not clear if she was comparing the trial to the coup, or subsequent corruption accusations and investigations that Musharraf ordered into Sharif.

Sharif’s disqualification stemmed from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy posh flats in London.

The Supreme Court initially declined to dismiss Sharif but ordered an investigation into his family’s wealth.

A separate Supreme Court-appointed panel said the family’s wealth did not match its income, and accused Maryam and her brothers of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy the London flats.

After the probe, the top court disqualified Sharif and ordered the NAB to investigate and conduct a trial. Sharif denies ever receiving the small source of income that led to his disqualification.

The NAB has in the past been described as toothless because of its low conviction rates, especially when it comes to powerful politicians, and investigations that last many years.

But the Supreme Court has ordered the trial to be concluded within six months.

(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year.

The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said.

“It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors.

PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results.

Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses.

It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay.

In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions.

“We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said.

The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion.

PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents.

Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space.

Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion.

Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.","PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CO2ZW-OCATC

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering tightening the vetting process for women and children seeking to enter the United States as refugees, a proposal that if adopted would bring security checks closer to those for adult men, three sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters.

The plan could slow down refugee admissions even after the end of a 120-day ban on most refugees instituted by the Trump administration while it reviews vetting procedures. The vetting review is set to end on Oct. 24.

President Donald Trump came into office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with the hard-line immigration policies that were a focal point of the Republican’s 2016 election campaign. Trump quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from some Middle Eastern and African countries that were challenged in court.

A U.S. official told reporters last month that the administration is “considering a wide range of potential measures and enhancements” to vetting.

Refugees currently undergo differing levels of security checks when applying for admission to the United States, depending on the perceived risk they might present, including running their biographic and biometric data against law enforcement and intelligence databases.

Women and young children go through a lower level of security screening than men, said the three sources with knowledge of the proposal, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The proposed changes would bring their security checks more in line with what is required for adult male refugees.

Successive Republican and Democratic administrations have focused most of their attention on adult men who tend to join militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State in greater numbers than women.

A State Department official declined to comment on any refugee vetting processes while the review is underway. The government is taking steps to “further intensify” refugee screening “to uphold the safety of the American people,” the official said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesman Dave Lapan declined to comment, and said the administration is “finalizing security enhancement recommendations as part of the 120-day review.”

A White House spokeswoman said there were “no announcements at this time.”

All refugees referred for resettlement in the United States are run through a database with watch-list information, called the Consular Lookout and Support System, or CLASS. Refugees can be singled out for a higher level of review based on their age, nationality, or gender. Syrian refugees, for instance, undergo extra checks.

Of the nearly 85,000 refugees admitted to the United States in the 2016 fiscal year, about 72 percent were women or children, according to the State Department. Total processing time for refugees to enter the United States now averages about 18 to 24 months, according to the State Department.

Trump’s order to halt refugee admissions so his administration could determine whether additional checks are necessary was suspended for months by federal judges. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually allowed it to go in effect for all refugees except those with close ties to the United States.

Trump also lowered the maximum number of refugees to be allowed into the United States in 2017 to 50,000 from the 110,000 originally set by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The 2018 level has been set at 45,000, the lowest number in decades.","Trump administration weighs tighter vetting for women, children refugees: sources",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-refugees/trump-administration-weighs-tighter-vetting-for-women-children-refugees-sources-idUSKBN1CO35P?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process said on Thursday.

Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting “went well,” the source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list.

“I don’t think he’s leaning yet,” the source said.

Other contenders to lead the U.S. central bank are top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. [nL2N1MS2D8]

Powell, who is viewed as representing a continuation of Yellen’s gradualist approach to raising interest rates, along with Warsh, are seen as the top contenders.

Despite his time as Fed Governor under Chair Ben Bernanke, Warsh is seen as a less well-known nominee. He has criticized the Fed’s bond-buying program and advocated changes in its inflation target.

U.S. Treasury yields briefly renewed their drop late Thursday after Politico reported that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell for the job.

Trump leaves on Nov. 3 for a tour of Asia and is expected to announce his choice before that trip.

The president told reporters on Tuesday that he likes all five candidates. “I’ll make a decision over the next fairly short period of time,” Trump said.

Meanwhile, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Freedom Caucus mounted a campaign to kill any chance of a second term for Yellen, the latest sign conservative Republicans want a fresh face at the helm of the Fed, which sets U.S. monetary policy.

Representative Warren Davidson, a Republican on the House Financial Services Committee’s monetary policy panel, is among those who want a change. He is circulating a letter opposing Yellen’s reappointment, the Ohio congressman’s spokesman said.

“Davidson is very passionate about this process,” the spokesman said, adding that the lawmaker is particularly concerned about the impact Fed policy has had on the ability of small firms to raise operating funds.

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative Republican grouping in Congress, have been critical of Yellen, with some accusing her of keeping monetary policy too loose.

Key members of the House Financial Services Committee also have backed ideas proposed by contenders to replace Yellen. Taylor’s research, for example, figured prominently in a House-passed bill requiring the Fed to explain its actions through a strict set of rules.

The House, however, has no direct control over the appointment of a Fed chief. The Senate decides whether to confirm the president’s nominee.

Trump has criticized Yellen in the past and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington by naming new people to top jobs and embracing different ideas. But his economic agenda could benefit from the steady economic conditions fostered by Yellen’s Fed.

Cohn’s chances of getting the job were thought to have dimmed after he publicly criticized the president’s response to a white supremacist rally in Virginia.

But the top White House economic adviser, who is helping to lead the administration’s push for tax reform, has since gotten back into Trump’s good graces.","Trump concludes Fed chair interviews, could decide next week: source",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-concludes-fed-chair-interviews-could-decide-next-week-source-idUSKBN1CO2LI?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein is planning to spend a lot more time in Frankfurt, he said on Thursday, as the Wall Street bank pushes ahead with plans to make the German city a major base after Britain leaves the European Union.

“Just left Frankfurt. Great meetings, great weather, really enjoyed it. Good, because I’ll be spending a lot more time there. #Brexit” Blankfein tweeted on Thursday.

The CEO had been meeting clients from across Germany and addressed a gathering of employees.

Britain is currently home to most of Goldman’s European operations where it has around 6,000 employees, but the firm needs to ensure it will still be able to service clients in the EU once Britain leaves the bloc and may have limited access to the EU’s single market.

Frankfurt is so far seen as the biggest beneficiary from Wall Street banks moving jobs out of London as a result of Brexit, with JPMorgan, Citi and Morgan Stanley all setting out plans to expand operations there.

Asked about the tweet, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said: “We’re not going to comment on each individual statement but let’s be clear, London is and will remain the world’s leading financial centre.”

“We have the breadth of talent, legal system, regulation and deep pools of capital that are simply unrivalled by centres anywhere else in Europe, and we are confident of securing an ambitious economic partnership with the EU that will include financial services.”

Earlier this month, Goldman said it had agreed to lease office space at a new building in Frankfurt, giving it space for up to 1,000 staff.

That would be five times the current staff of 200 and see it bolstering activities including trading, investment banking and asset management

Wolfgang Fink, Goldman’s co-head in Germany, said in September the bank may triple or quadruple its headcount in the country.

Jewel, de 43 años y cuyo nombre es Jewel Kilcher, utilizó herramientas de la práctica de “mindfulness” para sobrevivir a una dura infancia. Jewel compartió algunas de sus experiencias para la serie de Reuters “Lecciones de Vida”.

Pregunta: ¿Quién te transmitía lecciones de vida allá en Alaska?

Respuesta: La naturaleza, los libros, y el dolor. Mi mamá se fue cuando yo tenía ocho años y mi papá se encargó de criar tres niños, y era un alcohólico abusador. En Alaska con frecuencia te cría la naturaleza. Te enseña a cómo ser humano.

En ese tipo de ambiente extremo, uno no se alimenta a menos que mate o conserve algo. Así que hay mucho que superar, pero también te enseña que si trabajas duro y te centras, puedes hacer cualquier cosa.

P: ¿Qué te enseñó el dormir en tu coche sobre el dinero y la supervivencia?

R: La mayoría de la gente piensa que ese período se debió a que perseguía mi sueño de una carrera musical, pero eso no es del todo cierto. Mi jefe me hizo una propuesta de carácter sexual y como lo rechacé, me echó. Por eso viví un par de meses en mi coche, pero luego me lo robaron. Enfermé, me dieron ataques de pánico, casi morí de septicemia. En ese momento fue cuando comencé a robar mucho.

Cuando tenía 18 años y estaba en la calle, vi mi reflejo en un espejo y supe que me había convertido en una estadística. En ese momento decidí cambiar mi vida en base a una sentencia de Buda: la felicidad no depende de quién seas o qué tengas, depende de lo que pienses.

P: ¿Cómo fue pasar de esa vida a una de éxito y riqueza como músico?

R: Casi no firmé el contrato con la discográfica porque estaba asustada. Rechacé un bono de un millón de dólares. Aunque acepté una parte al final en caso de que la discográfica terminara ganando dinero.

P: ¿Cómo estás transformando este interés en el “mindfulness” en un negocio?

R: La web (jewelneverbroken.com) es sin ánimo de lucro y gratis para todo el mundo. Es un lugar para la salud emocional, donde las personas pueden acceder a simples herramientas de “mindfulness” para crear un cambio en su vida.

Como madre, no quería depender totalmente de las giras para vivir. Aún quería hacer música pero también quería ayudar a las personas con su dolor de otras maneras.

Así que una parte de mi negocio será B2B, trabajar con Zappos.com para crear la próxima frontera de la cultura corporativa. Otro aspecto será la educación, sobre cómo las personas pueden alcanzar un buen estado emocional, la crianza de sus hijos y las finanzas. También estoy creando un programa para estudiantes con “mindfulness” incluido, para que los chicos con adicciones o ansiedad puedan convertirse en los arquitectos de su propia vida.

P: ¿Cómo decides a qué destinar tu dinero?

R: Fundé Project Clean Water en 1997, porque cuando estuve en la calle no podía comprar agua embotellada. Si no podemos tomar nuestra agua del grifo, tenemos un problema. También fundé Never Broken Foundation para ayudar a las personas a alcanzar una buena salud emocional.

P: Como madre soltera de un niño de 6 años, ¿qué consejo le darías a otros padres solteros sobre cómo prosperar emocional y económicamente?

R: Uno tiene que desprenderse del mito del perfeccionismo. Los padres solteros siempre se sienten como un fracaso si están trabajando y criando un niño al mismo tiempo. Pero uno no es un fracaso, y no tiene que hacer las cosas perfectas. Hay que recordar que los niños nos están viendo, y está bien que vean los errores. Esto es la vida real y todos respondemos en tiempo real.","La cantante Jewel aprendió lecciones de vida de la naturaleza, los libros y el dolor",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idESKBN1CO0JJ-OESEN

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google is offering security experts a bounty to identify Android app flaws as the Alphabet Inc unit seeks to wipe out bugs from its Google Play store.

Each flaw will score at least $1,000 under the program announced on Thursday to back up automated checks that have failed to block malware and other problems that security experts say infect the 8-year-old app store far more than Apple Inc’s rival App Store.

Google will partner with HackerOne, a bug bounty program management website, to target a list of apps and flaws such as those that allow a hacker to redirect a user to a phishing website or infect a gadget with a virus.

Software scans cannot match a person’s ability to discover “a truly creative hack,” Vineet Buch, director of product management for Google Play Apps and Games, said in an interview.

The Google Play Security Reward Program effectively sponsors research into software created by other companies. Bug bounties by Microsoft Corp, Apple and Alphabet have been awarded only for tracing flaws in their own software.

“We don’t just care about our own apps, but rather the overall health of the ecosystem,” Buch said. “It’s like offering a reward for a missing person even if you don’t know who the missing person is personally.”

Google did not reveal the funding for its program, but said it would start small.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent of GDP, and may accelerate sales of government stakes in lenders and other companies as part of an effort to recapitalize banks, an adviser to the prime minister said on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has already used up nearly all of its budget for the current fiscal year and tax revenues are expected to fall far short of initial expectations. At the same time economic growth has slowed, sparking calls for more stimulus.

But Surjit Bhalla, a member of Modi’s Economic Advisory Council, told Reuters in an interview, that the government had stuck to its fiscal deficit targets over the past three years and is expected to do so this year as well.

The central bank has warned that missing the fiscal deficit target could lead to a spike in inflation, hurting macro-economic stability. Indian stocks slid last month on reports that a stimulus package worth up to 500 billion Indian rupees ($7.7 billion) might be in works - one that would widen the deficit to 3.7 percent of GDP.

Economic growth slipped to its lowest level in three years in the first quarter, logging an annual rate of 5.7 percent, but Bhalla said there were signs of recovery.

“I am more optimistic on the economy than I was two weeks ago,” he said, adding that last week’s industrial output and export data suggested fears about a slowdown were exaggerated.

Speaking at his home office in New Delhi, he said that GDP growth could be close to 6.5 percent for the fiscal year - although that forecast is lower than the central bank’s latest estimate of 6.7 percent.

Modi formed the Economic Advisory Council last month to address issues of macroeconomic importance and present its views to the prime minister. Bhalla said the council’s views on the fiscal deficit has been communicated to the government by its chairman, Bibek Debroy.

BANKING WOES

Sour loans in India’s banking sector hit a record 9.5 trillion rupees ($146 billion) at the end of June with stressed loans as a percentage of total loans at 12.6 percent - the highest level in at least 15 years.

That represents a major problem for Asia’s third largest economy, as provisions eat into profits and new lending is choked off. The bulk of the sector’s bad loans are held by the country’s 21 state-run banks.

Asked how much it would take to recapitalize state-run banks, Bhalla said: “My reading is that it would probably require about 1 trillion rupees ($15.4 billion).”

In contrast, Moody’s expects the top 11 state lenders alone will need nearly $15 billion, while Fitch Ratings estimates Indian banks will need $65 billion of additional capital by March 2019 to meet Basel III global banking rules.

Bhalla added the government could speed up the sale of its stakes in state-run banks and other companies to fund the recapitalization.

The government has allocated $3 billion in its budget for bank recapitalization, but senior finance ministry officials say a decision on an infusion of more funds could be taken by end-December.","India likely to stick to deficit target, may step up bank reform: Modi adviser",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-modi-adviser/exclusive-india-likely-to-stick-to-deficit-target-may-step-up-bank-reform-modi-adviser-idINKBN1CM0UU

In July, Meituan-Dianping’s vice-president of strategy told Reuters the firm was not considering an initial public offering until it had established infrastructure for services including offline retail, and had roughly $3 billion in cash reserves remaining from a previous funding round.

Sur les trois mois à fin septembre, le montant global des crédits accordés accuse un recul de 0,2% par rapport à un an plus tôt et leur nombre diminue plus encore (-6,3%).

Par comparaison, la production affichait encore des hausses trimestrielles de 29,9% à fin mars et de 4,1% à fin juin.

La tendance reste très favorable sur douze mois, grâce aux chiffres élevés de début de 2017, avec des montants en hausse de 15,3% et un nombre de crédits accordés en progression de 9,1%.

“Nous avons un effritement, qui commence a être visible sur tous les marchés, du nombre de prêts”, a souligné lors d‘une présentation Michel Mouillard, professeur d‘économie à l’Université Paris-Ouest et responsable des travaux de l‘Observatoire.

“Nous ne sommes pas en période d‘effondrement, nous ne sommes pas en ouverture de récession, nous sommes en période d‘atterrissage de la production et des marchés, nous sommes encore en ‘soft’ landing”, a-t-il ajouté.

Selon lui, la raison n‘est pas à trouver dans les conditions de financement toujours favorables - le taux moyen des crédits (1,56% en septembre) est pratiquement stable depuis avril, juste au-dessus des plus bas (1,31%) de novembre - mais dans la hausse rapide des coûts des transactions financées par emprunt.

Elle atteint 5,9% sur les neuf premiers mois de 2017 par rapport à la même période de 2016, après avoir déjà augmenté de 4,3% l‘an passé, pendant que les revenus des ménages qui réalisent ces opérations n‘ont progressé que de 1,7% (après +0,6% en 2016).

UN MARCHE PLUS DIFFICILE POUR LES MOINS RICHES

En conséquence, le coût relatif des opérations immobilières est monté à 5,0 années de revenus, soit le niveau le plus élevé constaté depuis le lancement de l‘Observatoire au début des années 2000, contre 4,86 l‘an passé à la même époque, et 4,48 en 2007, le sommet d‘avant-crise.

Cette situation est particulièrement pénalisante pour les catégories les plus jeunes et les plus modestes, les principaux bénéficiaires des aides à l‘accession à la propriété dans le neuf, qui ont alimenté le rebond du marché jusqu‘en 2016.

La part des moins de 35 ans pour les emprunteurs dans le neuf est passée en un an de 50,1% à 49,2% et celle des accédants modestes (moins de 3 smic) de 37,8% à 37,1%. Par comparaison, elles se situaient à respectivement 54,7% et 43,9% en 2009.

“Il y a une dégradation pour les clientèles les plus modestes”, souligne Michel Mouillard, “ceux qui ont porté l‘expansion des marchés ces dernières années, notamment dans le neuf, sont en train de sortir progressivement”.

L‘universitaire ne voit pas pour l‘instant d‘inflexion du marché lié aux récentes annonces du gouvernement en matière de logement, comme le recentrage des dispositifs de soutien à l‘investissement locatif et l‘accession à la propriété (prêt à taux zéro, PTZ, et aides publiques, APL) sur les zones tendues.

Mais il s‘inquiète de la disparition du dispositif “APL accession” et de la division par deux du montant des PTZ - une concession du président Emmanuel Macron, qui voulait à l‘origine le supprimer complètement - dans les zones rurales, qui toucheront les prétendants à l‘accession les moins riches.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Black people in Canada’s most populous province spent longer behind bars awaiting trial than white people charged with many of the same categories of crimes in each of the past five years, according to data obtained by Reuters.

Between April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.

The data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)

Among the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.

In three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.

The data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.

Reuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.

A spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.

More than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.

Unlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.

A surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.

Current and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.

HARDER ON THE POOR

Critics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.

“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”

The data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.

Reuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.

Studies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.

This makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.

In a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.

The court did not address race in its ruling.

Trump declined to opine on whether the process would be easier if Puerto Rico were a state rather than a territory - a hot-button political issue on the island.

Already mired in debt after years of recession, the U.S. territory faces storm-related damages that some estimates have pegged as high as $95 billion, and has asked the federal government to make exceptions to rules that typically require states and local governments to shoulder part of the cost of recovery.

Trump did not give any specifics about how much money the government may give or loan to the cash-strapped territory, home to 3.4 million U.S. citizens.

“I have given my blessing to Congress, and Congress is working with you and your representatives on coming up with a plan and a payment plan and how it’s all going to be funded. Because you are talking about some substantial numbers,” Trump said to Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello at the beginning of an Oval Office meeting.

Trump and some of his top aides suggested last week that there would be limits to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington. But on Thursday, the president’s remarks were broadly supportive.

The hurricane laid waste to the island’s power grid, destroying homes, roads and other vital infrastructure. The bankrupt territory is still struggling to provide basic services like running water. An oversight board charged with resolving Puerto Rico’s debt crisis has said the island’s government would run out of money by the end of the month without help.

Trump emphasized that repayment of federal loans and other storm-related debt owed by Puerto Rico would come before repayment of the island’s existing $72 billion in debt.

“Any money that’s put in by people - whether it’s public or private - they’re going to want to come in first position,” Trump said.

“We’re going to coming before - far before - any existing debt that’s on the island,” he said.

Trump declined to opine on whether the process would be easier if Puerto Rico were a state rather than a territory - a hot-button political issue on the island.

“You’ll get me into trouble with that question,” he told a reporter.

SENATE TO VOTE

While in Washington, Rossello also met with Senate leaders. The Senate is expected to vote in coming days on an aid package that includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been helping Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands recover from three massive hurricanes.

Some senators would like to see more funds added to that package, Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told reporters.

Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who has been deeply involved in discussions over the aid, said earlier on Thursday that he wants to tweak the bill so the island could more quickly access funds.

Congress is expected to consider another aid package by the end of December, but that could be too late for the island, which currently has no tax revenue, Rubio said.

“I know from experience the further away we get from these hurricanes, the less of a sense of urgency there is,” Rubio said.

Rossello has asked the federal government for approval to use disaster aid to cover a broad range of costs. He has also asked the White House and Congress for at least $4.6 billion in block grants and other types of funding.

“The reality is that we still need to do a lot more for the people of Puerto Rico and that’s why we’re meeting,” Rossello said.

The consumer giant that fended off a bid from Kraft Heinz earlier this year reported weak third-quarter sales on Thursday. Chief Executive Paul Polman is sprucing up brands, but the more pedestrian Unilever’s performance, the more vulnerable it becomes.

The maker of pot-noodles blamed factors beyond its control for a weak third quarter, which saw sales excluding disposals and acquisitions rise by 2.6 percent, well short of analysts’ expectations of 3.9 percent. The hot summer meant people ate less ice cream, while hurricanes disrupted spending and shipping.

Yet the figures also reflect longer-term challenges. Growth in developed economies is slow, and health-conscious customers are changing their habits, meaning consumer goods companies cannot rely on old brands. One example: Halo Top, a family-owned healthy ice cream brand, grabbed share in North America. Unilever reckons just half its products took a bigger slice of their respective markets, down from around 60 percent in previous years.

Polman is making the right calls. He is selling dying brands, like margarine, buying new ones, and finding fresh ways of distributing products, like direct-to-consumer subscription services. And while the outlook in Europe and North America is dull, emerging economies are growing quickly. Unilever is also pushing up margins: analysts expect the company to convert 20 percent of sales into operating profit by 2020.

Still, Polman can’t rest easy. Unilever will need a strong fourth quarter if it is to meet its target for sales growth of 3 to 5 percent this year. More disappointments could revive takeover interest. Investors might look more favourably on Kraft Heinz’s near-30 percent operating margin if Unilever’s growth remains little better than average. Activist investors who are taking on ever-bigger targets such as Procter & Gamble, might also see the company as a candidate for deeper cost cutting and more radical surgery.

(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year.

The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said.

“It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors.

PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results.

Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses.

It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay.

In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions.

“We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said.

The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion.

PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents.

Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space.

Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion.

Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.","PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-hldg-results/paypal-tops-profit-estimates-lifts-target-on-mobile-payments-growth-idUKKBN1CO2ZW?il=0

BOSTON (Reuters) - A Brazilian whose arrest led U.S. authorities to discover $17 million hidden under a mattress pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges that he tried to launder funds tied to one of the largest pyramid schemes ever.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

They said that after Rocha was arrested, he helped agents locate the apartment, where they found $17 million hidden under a mattress.",Brazilian who led U.S. to $17 million under mattress pleads guilty,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1CO2I1

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Since two massive earthquakes hit Mexico in September, claiming more than 460 lives, an early warning start-up called SkyAlert has doubled its users to 5.8 million, making it one of the country’s most downloaded apps.

SkyAlert has also found a market selling alarms to small businesses in the capital, said its co-founder and director Alvaro Velasco. And it is looking to expand to Latin America, mainly Colombia, Peru and Chile, which lack an official alerting system despite frequent quakes in those countries.

Velasco said that he and SkyAlert co-founder Alejandro Cantú are talking to investors from Mexico and elsewhere about raising 100 million pesos ($5.35 million) in capitalization in 2018.

He said the surge in users after the most recent deadly quake in Mexico City had heightened the interest of existing investors including U.S.-based American Messaging and attracted interest from two Mexico-based private equity funds.

American Messaging did not respond to requests to comment on any potential new investment.

Velasco said SkyAlert was in talks with those funds and existing investors to inject around 20 million pesos (1.05 million dollars) into SkyAlert.

Still, finding a sustainable business model for the quake monitoring app has been a challenge partly because recent regulation in Mexico City has limited SkyAlert’s ability to access funds through public financing.

MAKING A PROFIT NOT EASY

Shomit Ghose at Onset Ventures, a U.S. private equity company with experience in software start-ups, said quake apps have struggled to get adequate financing because of the lack of a clear path to profits.

“If the business model is B2B where the earthquake early-warning is sent to companies, or railways, or hospitals, or high-buildings then perhaps a strong B2B case can be made for start-up investment,” Ghose said.

SkyAlert’s predicament echoes that of companies seeking funding to develop earthquake alert apps in the United States. Seismic activity is hard to monetize without government support.

It competes with its former partner, Mexico’s official alerting system run by government-funded non profit CIRES, which was created after an earthquake in 1985 killed thousands in the country.

One of the world’s few widely deployed seismic alarms, CIRES runs a network of sirens positioned around Mexico City that warn of a coming quake. SkyAlert mainly warns people through a mobile app.

Both sell quake warning systems, but a 2016 regulatory reform requires public buildings in Mexico City to purchase alarm systems from CIRES, limiting SkyAlert’s public financing.

SkyAlert initially replicated CIRES’ alerts, but in 2015 it decided to deploy its own detection sensors to increase coverage with greater accuracy, Velasco said.

“After a few false alerts from CIRES that affected SkyAlert’s credibility, we decided to invest in our own technology,” he said.

SkyAlert also is exploring ways to monetize its free app.

Currently, it sells a “premium” version for $4 a year that allows users to personalize alerts. However, Mexico has an average per capita income of $8,200, and the company said only around 4 percent of users pay for it.

Velasco said SkyAlert’s revenue is split fairly evenly between those fees and income from selling to businesses.

The newest version of the app allows for paid advertising, but ads would not be visible during a seismic alert.

SkyAlert, founded in 2011, has few peers, but one similar service in Japan is called YureKuru Call, which relies on government seismic data. YureKuru has received some government funding on an ad-hoc basis, but like SkyAlert is mostly funded by fees, said Rina Suzuki, an official at RC Solution Co., the Tokyo-based firm that developed YureKuru.

Detection technologies are evolving and they are all perfectible, Jennifer Strauss, external relations officer at the Berkeley Seismology Lab told Reuters.

“In the end, what matters is how effective they are at alerting people to save lives,” said Strauss.","After massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app",https://in.reuters.com/article/mexico-quake-app/after-massive-quakes-millions-in-mexico-turn-to-early-warning-app-idINKBN1CO35V

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) has agreed to pay $120 million to resolve claims from 49 U.S. states and the District of Columbia over faulty ignition switches, state attorneys general and the company said on Thursday.

The largest U.S. automaker had previously paid about $2.5 billion in penalties and settlements over faulty ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes. The defect has been linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries, and prompted a recall that began in February 2014 of 2.6 million vehicles.

GM spokesman David Caldwell said the Detroit automaker had reached a settlement with states over the more than 3-year-old consumer protection investigations.

“GM will continue ongoing improvements it’s made to ensure the safety of its vehicles,” Caldwell said. These include retaining a new organizational structure devoted to global vehicle safety and a program that encourages employees to speak up about possible safety issues.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement GM had “turned a blind eye for years and chose to conceal the safety defects associated with several models of their vehicles.”

Under the settlement, GM dealers must not sell certified pre-owned vehicles with uncompleted recalls, and is required to have a team to “improve and enhance recall awareness to car owners with open recalls.”

Some states said they would use settlement funds to investigate and prosecute future deceptive practices.

In 2015, GM paid $900 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation and agreed to three years of oversight by an independent monitor after being charged with wire fraud.

GM shares closed up 0.5 percent at $45.35.

No individuals were charged, but Chief Executive Mary Barra fired 15 people, including eight executives, over the issue. Barra said last week the ignition recall was “a moment in time where the company committed deeply to safety.”

The states said GM knew as early as 2004 that the ignition switch posed a safety defect because it could cause airbag non-deployment, but company officials decided it was not a safety concern and delayed recalls.

The issue prompted an industrywide jump in recalls in 2014 to an all-time high and cast a spotlight on GM’s safety record as Barra testified before the U.S. Congress.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Thursday described Russian interference in U.S. elections as “warfare.”

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help President Donald Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied.

“We have to be so hard on this and we have to hold them accountable,” Haley said during a panel discussion with former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice held by the George W. Bush Institute in New York on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, urged voters in New Jersey to reject the “politics of division” by supporting Democrats in next month’s state elections.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama said New Jersey could send a powerful signal about the type of politics it wants by voting for Democrat Phil Murphy in the Nov. 7 governor race.

“You’re going to send a message to the country and send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division, we are rejecting a politics of fear, that we are embracing a politics that says everybody counts,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark that chanted: “Four more years.”

It was the first of two public appearances by Obama on Thursday on behalf of Democratic candidates for governor. He will appear later in Richmond, Virginia. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding elections for governor this year.

Those contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can turn the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The two governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could be a preview of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Obama made his comments just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took a thinly veiled swipe at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade. [L2N1MU1XD]

Trump’s combative style and inflammatory comments have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

But in New Jersey, Obama focused on urging supporters to turn out their friends and families to vote. Democrats hope Obama can help bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

‘CAN‘T TAKE ELECTION FOR GRANTED’

Opinion polls show Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the New Jersey lieutenant governor, who is hindered by the unpopularity in the state of Trump and Republican Governor Chris Christie.

But Obama said no one should assume a victory is in the cards, making an indirect reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

“You can’t take this election or any election for granted. I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said.

Obama will appear on Thursday night in the political battleground of Virginia, which is viewed as a potential bellwether. Opinion polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior White House aide said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets.

Marc Short, the White House’s top liaison to Congress, said on CNN that Obamacare’s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal.

“We’re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we’re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,” Short said.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving the subsidies, which Trump has discontinued, for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage.

The bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on Thursday after several Republican senators said they would support the measure. But Short’s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement. Democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of Obamacare.

Short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the bill’s co-authors and would likely make them public.

“The gist is we believe that the individual mandate should (be) repealed, employer mandate repealed and allow Americans to contribute to health savings accounts,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Alexander and Murray said the deal they struck now has the support of 12 of the 52 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate, as well as 12 Democrats.

While Alexander predicted in remarks on the Senate floor that the plan “will become law in some fashion before the end of the year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is against it.

Lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the Senate floor tucked inside a bigger “must-pass” bill that Congress needs to act on in December, such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown.

Trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. But his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra-party divisions.

Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance to 20 million people but Republicans call it government interference in Americans’ healthcare.

The law’s individual mandate requires all Americans to purchase health insurance, while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage.

TRUMP REVERSES POSITION

Trump initially indicated support for the Alexander-Murray agreement but reversed himself, saying on Wednesday “I can never support bailing out” insurers.

Senator Mike Rounds, one of the bill’s Republican co-sponsors, said that if Trump decides he does not support it, “then it will not go forward.” When a reporter noted that Trump does oppose it, Rounds replied, “That was yesterday.”

Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, who focuses on healthcare, said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing, with Trump “flip-flopping every day” and Ryan not supportive of the bill.

Among hospital stocks, Community Health Systems (CYH.N) closed up 3.7 percent, Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) rose 2.9 percent and HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA.N) gained 3 percent. Most insurers rose more modestly.

Without the subsidies, insurance premiums for some of the 10 million Americans who get coverage through Obamacare markets will surge. Noting that some conservative Republicans object to the subsidies, Alexander asked, “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy insurance, or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created?”

The bill has broad support among Democrats, but had just seven Republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier.

Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, who co-authored a bill in September to repeal and replace Obamacare that failed to muster enough support, endorsed the bipartisan effort.

“We believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long-term solution” that would overhaul Obamacare, they said in a joint statement.

If passed in December, as opposed to before the Nov. 1 beginning of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare insurance policies, it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year, meaning its benefits might not be felt until 2019. Insurers have already decided whether to participate in the Obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

The bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

Many Senate Republicans are nervous about the prospect of voting on any healthcare measure - no matter what legislation it may be attached to - that buttresses Obamacare.

Part of the fear, one senior Senate Republican aide said, is that Trump’s former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is recruiting hard-line conservative primary challengers to run against incumbent Republican senators next year. The aide said incumbents do not want to be forced to cast a controversial vote to stabilize Obamacare, a law reviled by many conservatives.

If all 46 Senate Democrats and two independents back the Alexander-Murray bill as expected, the support of the 12 Republicans means the bill has the 60 votes needed to reach the super-majority required to pass most legislation in the Senate.

Trump on Thursday underscored his concerns about the bill. He urged Alexander and Murray to be “careful with respect to the insurance companies,” which he said are “extremely talented at making money.”

Alexander and Murray said their legislation does not bail out insurers. Alexander said House Republicans passed an Obamacare repeal and replace bill in May that also would continue subsidy payments for two years.

Alexander said Trump has called him four times in recent days on this subject, including a Saturday night call when he was at a restaurant and “my dinner got cold.” He urged the president to support the initiative.",White House says rollback of Obamacare must be part of short-term fix,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/white-house-says-rollback-of-obamacare-must-be-part-of-short-term-fix-idUSKBN1CO2N7?il=0

SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin launched one of his most stinging critiques of U.S. foreign policy on Thursday, listing what he called some of the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.

He declined to say if he would run for a fourth presidential term in an election set for March, though he is expected to stand after dominating Russian politics for 18 years.

Instead, he used a high-profile televised discussion with foreign academics in southern Russia to reach back to what he regards as the darkest days of U.S.-Russia relations.

Opinion polls suggest that harsh rhetoric towards the West plays well with many Russian voters, who credit Putin for restoring national pride and standing up to what they see as Western encroachment.

Asked by a Germany-based academic to identify what mistakes Moscow had made in its relations with the West, Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi:

“Our biggest mistake was that we trusted you too much. You interpreted our trust as weakness and you exploited that.”

Visibly angry at times, Putin cast Russia as the wronged party and its post-Soviet leadership as too naive and trusting.

“Unfortunately, our Western partners, having divided the USSR’s geopolitical legacy, were certain of their own incontestable righteousness having declared themselves the victors of the ‘Cold War,'” said Putin.

“They started to openly interfere in the sovereign affairs of countries and to export democracy in the same way as in their time the Soviet leadership tried to export the Socialist revolution to the whole world.”

Putin said U.S.-Russia relations were in a lamentable state, referencing an “unprecedented” anti-Russian campaign in the United States, the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities there and pressure on Russian media by U.S. authorities.

He did not single out U.S. President Donald Trump for personal criticism, but said Trump’s behavior was unpredictable as a result of political foes who were preventing him from fulfilling almost all of his policy pledges.

LITANY OF U.S. SLIGHTS

Putin said the United States was trying to squeeze Russia out of European energy markets with its latest batch of sanctions, which Trump grudgingly signed into law in August after Congress approved them.

“The recent sanctions package adopted by the U.S. Congress was openly designed to push Russia out of European energy markets and to force Europe to switch to more expensive liquefied natural gas from the United States, even though the volumes there are not yet sufficient,” he said.

He criticized Trump’s predecessors, describing how he believed the United States had betrayed Russia in the 1990s by not reciprocating what he called the unprecedented access Moscow gave Washington to Russia’s secret nuclear facilities.

He said the United States had flouted nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, saying Moscow had diligently complied with the same pacts only to be repeatedly let down by the United States.

His speech and ripostes in a punchy question and answer session that followed often sounded like a history lesson.

The United States had tried to stir up separatism in southern Russia in the 1990s, said Putin, something he said he knew for a fact from his stint leading the FSB spy agency.

The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and NATO’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia were bad, he said.

And in comments that could have been drawn straight from the pages of the Cold War, Putin accused the United States of upsetting the strategic nuclear balance by modernizing its arsenal of weapons.

Russia would develop new weapons systems, he pledged, if it was forced to, and if the United States withdrew from a landmark arms control treaty -- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- Russia would hit back fast.

“From our side, the response will be instant, and I want to warn, symmetrical,” said Putin.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus SE’s deal with Bombardier (BBDb.TO) boosts confidence in the CSeries jet program but may not spur many new sales until it is finalized and a U.S. trade dispute is resolved, the head of a major aircraft leasing firm said on Thursday.

Airbus (AIR.PA) on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program, securing the plane’s future and giving the Canadian firm a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N) and U.S. regulators.

The lightweight, carbon-composite jet, which cost $6 billion to develop, has won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months.

“People are feeling better about the CSeries but it’s all on the expectation that Airbus concludes the transaction,” said John Plueger, the chief executive officer of Air Lease Corp (AL.N).

The deal is subject to Canadian government approval.

Bombardier is counting on the agreement to help trim costs and boost CSeries sales.

Its strategy to remove the “cloud” of uncertainty that has weighed on CSeries orders, is dependent in part on making jets for American customers like Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) at Airbus’s Alabama production facility, instead of in Canada where Bombardier is based. That could avoid potentially punitive duties stemming from its dispute with Boeing over alleged unfair trade practices.

“That cloud is still there until the transaction concludes.(but) that cloud is perhaps not as dark or as ominous,” Plueger said.

He declined to say whether Air Lease Corp, which has total assets of $15 billion, would now consider buying the CSeries. But he noted that leasing companies would likely hold off until the CSeries had enough orders to ensure strong resale value for the plane.

“Part of the life and blood measurement of any airplane is how deep is the operator base,” Plueger said in a phone interview from New York.

Plueger also said the deal with Airbus may drive Boeing to take another look at the 100 to 149 seat space and at least contemplate an alliance with an existing planemaker, to ratchet up competition. Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) which competes with Bombardier in the smaller regional jets market, is one strong possibility, he said.

“The question is does Boeing rethink Embraer?” Plueger asked. “It will depend upon their assessment of how much additional market presence this brings to Airbus.”",Airbus CSeries deal unlikely to spur quick boost in sales: Air Lease CEO,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bombardier-airbus-boeing/airbus-cseries-deal-unlikely-to-spur-quick-boost-in-sales-air-lease-ceo-idUSKBN1CO31H

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

“The cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,” said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year’s election, introduced legislation on Thursday to extend rules governing political advertising on television, print and radio to also cover social media like Facebook Inc (FB.O).

Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner and Republican John McCain introduced the “Honest Ads Act,” one of the strongest efforts in Congress yet to address allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.

The legislation would expand existing election law covering television and radio outlets to apply to paid internet and digital advertisements on platforms like Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

“Our laws have failed to keep up with evolving technology and the capabilities of our foreign adversaries,” Klobuchar told a news conference.

The measure would also require digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly views to maintain a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by anyone spending more than $500.

And it would require online platforms to make “all reasonable efforts” to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not buying political advertisements to influence the U.S. electorate.

Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Representative Mike Coffman and Democrat Derek Kilmer.

Social media companies have become an increasing focus of congressional investigations into allegations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election on behalf of Republican candidate Donald Trump, something now-President Trump and Moscow deny.

Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, said $150,000 of ads paid for in rubles may be only the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of how many political advertisements were bought by foreign firms. He said advertisements could have been purchased using dollars, euros or pounds.

U.S. law bars foreigners from spending money to attempt to influence American elections.

Warner and Klobuchar acknowledged that the companies have resisted the legislation. But Warner said, “It’s our hope that the social media companies and platform companies will work with us.”

WILL IT PASS?

It was not immediately clear how much support the act would receive in Congress or when it might come up for a vote.

Social media companies have begun a lobbying campaign to at least influence, if not prevent, the bill.

The companies said they are open to working with Congress and have been turning over information, but are legally obligated to protect their users’ privacy. Facebook has turned over thousands of ads to congressional investigators and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, met with members of Congress last week.

Google said it was look at steps it could take on its various platforms and would work closely with Congress, the Federal Election Commission and the industry to come up with solutions.

“We support efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse,” Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in an emailed statement.

Klobuchar and Warner said it was possible the measure could be offered an amendment to another larger piece of legislation.

Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating the alleged Russian hacking and the possibility that Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow.

Klobuchar is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which helps oversee elections. And McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

They said they would like it to become law by early next year, well ahead of the November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, in which every seat in the 435-member House and about one third of the 100-seat Senate will be up for grabs

Many lawmakers and other U.S. officials have said they fear Russian efforts to meddle in those polls as well.

Separately, Facebook, Twitter and Google said Thursday they would send their general counsels to testify Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees.

General counsel Colin Stretch will be the Facebook representative to testify before both committees, company spokesman Andy Stone said. The company’s high-profile Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sandberg will not appear.

A Twitter spokeswoman said Acting General Counsel Sean Edgett will represent the microblogging site. A Google spokeswoman said General Counsel Kent Walker would represent that company.","U.S. lawmakers want crackdown on Facebook, Twitter political ads",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-facebook/u-s-lawmakers-want-crackdown-on-facebook-twitter-political-ads-idUSKBN1CO23R

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to its lowest level in more than 44-1/2 years last week, pointing to a rebound in job growth after a hurricane-related decline in employment in September.

The labor market outlook was also bolstered by another report on Thursday showing a measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region racing to a record high in October. The signs of labor market strength could cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

“It doesn’t take one hundred PhD economists at the Fed to figure out that the labor market is on the tight side of normal,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. “At this point, we would expect a sharp bounce-back in employment growth in October.”

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said. But the decrease in claims, which was the largest since April, was probably exaggerated by the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.

Claims are declining as the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma washes out of the data. The hurricanes, which lashed Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, boosted claims to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September.

A Labor Department official said claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico continued to be impacted by Irma and Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure. As a result the Labor Department was estimating claims for the islands.

Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey left more than 100,000 restaurant workers temporarily unemployed. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are not included in nonfarm payrolls.

Economists had forecast claims slipping to 240,000 in the latest week. The dollar briefly pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors booked profits after a recent rally that lifted shares to record highs. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Last week marked the 137th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

Improvements in the labor market have been largely due to a recovery that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term. While U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax plans, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies.

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Tightening labor market conditions likely keep the Fed on track to raise interest in December for a third time this year, even as inflation remains moderate.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,500 to 248,250 last week.

The claims data covered the survey week for October nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 20,500 between the September and October survey periods, supporting views of a rebound in job growth this month.

“The data suggest that the underlying trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining,” said Jim O‘Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region soared 24 points to a record high reading of 30.6 in October.

The average workweek index also increased 8 points to a reading of 19.4. It said no firms reported decreases in employment this month. The robust labor market readings helped to lift the Philadelphia Fed’s current manufacturing activity index four points to a five-month high of 27.9 in October, offsetting declines in new orders and shipments measures.

Also underscoring labor market strength, the claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 16,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since December 1973.

The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims fell 22,750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.",U.S. jobless claims hit 44-1/2-year low; mid-Atlantic factories humming,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment/u-s-jobless-claims-hit-44-1-2-year-low-mid-atlantic-factories-humming-idUSKBN1CO1RU?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The budget resolution contains a legislative tool called reconciliation, which would enable Republicans, who control the 100-seat Senate by a 52-48 margin, to move tax legislation through the Senate on a simple majority vote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code headed for a pivotal moment on Thursday, with Senate Republicans poised to approve a budget measure that would help them pass tax legislation without Democratic support.

The Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for Republicans to meet their goal of enacting a tax bill and sending it to Trump for his signature by the end of this year.

“I think we have the votes for the budget, which will be phase one of our massive tax cuts - and reform,” Trump told reporters on Thursday.

The budget resolution contains a legislative tool called reconciliation, which would enable Republicans, who control the 100-seat Senate by a 52-48 margin, to move tax legislation through the Senate on a simple majority vote. Otherwise, tax reform would need 60 votes and would likely fail.

Although Republican Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, has threatened to oppose the budget resolution, Senate Republicans appeared to have enough support to approve it with at least 50 votes, along with a possible tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence.

After failing to approve Trump-backed legislation to overturn Obamacare, Senate Republicans are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform, beginning with the budget measure, which would allow tax legislation to add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade to pay for tax cuts.

If the budget measure passes, it will have to be reconciled with a markedly different resolution from the House of Representatives, which calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill. House Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks, setting the stage for introduction of a House tax bill by early November.

Republican success on reconciliation would all but rule out broad Democratic support for the Trump tax plan, which promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals.

“There is still a chance to turn back from this budget and the one-party legislating that has stymied this Congress and been such folly,” Senate Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Democrat, said ahead of Thursday’s vote.

Trump sought the support of six Senate Democrats for his plan at a Wednesday meeting with Senate Finance Committee members from both parties. Five of the six Democrats, whom the White House described as open to working with Trump on taxes, are up for reelection next year in states that Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election.

The White House contends that the Republicans’ plan to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.

But Senator Ron Wyden, the top Senate Finance Democrat, who attended the White House meeting, said he made clear to Trump that Democrats believe his plan would benefit the wealthy, raise taxes on some middle-class Americans and increase the federal deficit.

“There is a Grand Canyon-sized gap between the rhetoric surrounding this plan and reality,” Wyden told reporters.",Senate heads for vote crucial to Trump's tax reform plan,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/senate-heads-for-vote-crucial-to-trumps-tax-reform-plan-idUSKBN1CO0ET?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers could pay $275 million to cover the insured portion of drugmaker Merck & Co’s loss from a cyber attack in June, according to a forecast by Verisk Analytics Inc’s Property Claim Services (PCS) unit.

Merck, however, has not disclosed the magnitude of its uninsured losses from the “NotPetya” attack, which disrupted production of some Merck medicines and vaccines.

The company was among dozens of firms worldwide hit in the June 27 attack, which began in Ukraine, then rapidly spread through corporate networks of multinationals with operations or suppliers in Eastern Europe.

“Merck has not yet fully quantified its losses, much less given any of its insurers an estimate of the total amount of those losses,” Merck spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said in a statement.

She reiterated that Merck has insurance that would cover some costs, but declined to elaborate or say how much Merck expects to have to pay on its own.

The drugmaker said in July that it had suffered a worldwide disruption of its operations as a result of the malware. It was still in the process of restoring its manufacturing operations a month later.

Merck said then that it was confident it would be able to maintain a continuous supply of its top-selling and life-saving drugs, but warned of temporary delays in delivering some other products.

NotPetya is a destructive virus that spread quickly across computer networks, crippling computers by encrypting hard drives so that machines cannot run. The attacks caused massive disruptions to industrial networks that rely on computers because businesses must individually replace damaged drives, a labor-intensive process.

Cyber insurance can be expensive to buy and is not widely used outside the United States, with one insurer previously describing the cost as $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance.

Policies typically cover expenses stemming from a data breach, such as forensics and data restoration, among other costs. Coverage also helps pay for business interruption expenses when a breach or malware attack shuts down a company’s website.

Some companies without cyber insurance have used their policies covering kidnap, ransom and extortion to recoup losses caused by ransomware viruses.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s wife Grace has sued a Belgium-based businessman for failing to deliver a $1.35 million ring she ordered for a wedding anniversary, state media reported on Wednesday.

Grace, 52, an influential figure in Mugabe’s ruling ZANU-PF party and seen as a potential successor to her husband, is nicknamed “Gucci Grace” for her reputed dedication to shopping.

But she and her 93-year-old husband have kept their assets under wraps despite frequent local private media reports on Grace buying properties in Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The Herald, a government-controlled newspaper, reported that Grace was suing businessman Jamal Hamed after a deal to have Hamed supply the First Lady with a diamond ring turned sour.

Grace’s spokeswoman Olga Bungu could not be reached for comment on Wednesday while her lawyer Wilson Manase, who filed the papers at the High Court, was said to be attending court.

In court papers seen by the Herald, Grace said she had in 2015 ordered the ring for her 20-year wedding anniversary last year but Hamed failed to deliver and refunded her only $120,000.

The First Lady asked the High Court to attach properties and three companies owned by Hamed in Harare, the Herald said.

Hamed told Reuters from Belgium that he had not been served with the court papers. His Harare-based lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, said she had not seen the papers.

“We have not received anything at all and I am not in Harare to be served any claim or false allegations,” Hamed said.

In Zimbabwe, at least 8 out of 10 potential workers are unemployed. The average national monthly income is $200 and news of the million-dollar ring was immediately greeted with scorn on social media.

Mugabe, who says he leads a frugal life, and Grace own a dairy company and several farms near Harare. The two have never responded to media reports that they own several properties.

Last year, Hamed accused Grace of seizing his Harare properties following the dispute and asked the High Court to intervene. He then said Grace had threatened her if he ever returned to Zimbabwe.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders said on Thursday they looked forward to seeing proposals on taxing online giants by early 2018 but in a nod to concerns from countries like Ireland said EU efforts had to be in line with work under way at a global level.

European countries are split over whether online companies such as Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) should pay more tax, with smaller EU members such as Ireland and Luxembourg - which host many online businesses - worried that taxes would hurt their competitiveness without a global solution.

Countries like Italy and France on the other hand are frustrated by the low tax rates online giants pay by re-routing profits through low-rate countries and insist the EU should go it alone if the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States and Japan, is unable to reach an agreement on a global solution.

Meeting for an EU summit, the leaders said in their conclusions that they looked forward to “appropriate (European) Commission proposals by early 2018.”

However they referred to the need to ensure a “global level-playing field in line with the work currently under way at the OECD”, a change from earlier draft summit conclusions which did not mention “global” or link the OECD work to EU efforts.

Last month the European Commission outlined three options for taxing internet companies: taxing the turnover rather than the profits of digital firms, putting a levy on online ads and imposing a withholding tax on payments to internet firms.

In the longer term the EU wants to change existing taxation rights to make sure digital firms with large operations but no physical presence in a given country pay taxes there instead of being allowed to re-route their profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

Retail sales volumes fell 0.8 percent in September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, reversing a jump in August and undershooting all economists’ forecasts in a Reuters poll. Third-quarter growth slowed to its lowest year-on-year rate since the second quarter of 2013 at 1.5 percent.

Last month the BoE said it was likely to raise interest rates in the coming months if the economy and inflation pressures strengthen as expected, but in recent days a few investors have begun to doubt if the BoE will move as soon as next month.

Markets see a roughly 80 percent chance of a rate rise on Nov. 2 after the BoE’s next meeting, but sterling fell to a one-week low of $1.3126 after the data on Thursday as rate futures pared back the odds of further rate increases in 2018.

“Uncomfortable questions have been raised about just where UK growth is going to emerge from in Q4,” said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange services company WorldFirst.

“We will find out in the coming months whether this is consumers holding off on purchases in preparation for Christmas, or whether the Bank of England’s messaging on interest rate rises has been enough to keep some hands in pockets.”

BoE policymakers said in September that consumer demand was showing signs of improving after weakness earlier in the year, though it was too soon to tell if it would compensate for weak business investment.

The ONS said Thursday’s figures pointed to retail sales adding 0.03 percentage points to economic growth in the third quarter, compared with 0.09 percentage points in Q2. The BoE and most economists expect economic growth of around 0.3 percent.

LESS FOR THEIR MONEY

The rising cost of goods in stores - which are now increasing at their fastest since March 2012 - meant the amount British shoppers were getting for their money was growing more slowly than the amount they spent, the ONS said.

“The slump in retail sales in September was driven by retailers implementing large price rises,” Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.

However, he and other economists cautioned against drawing too strong conclusions about the overall health of consumer demand from trends in retail sales.

Compared with a year earlier, sales volumes in September alone were up 1.2 percent versus the average forecast in a Reuters poll of a 2.1 percent rise.

Consumer price inflation hit a five-year high of 3.0 percent in September, largely reflecting the fall in the pound pushing up the cost of imports since last year’s Brexit vote.

Pay has not kept up. Official data on Wednesday showed that regular pay in the three months to August was 0.4 percent lower in real terms than in 2016 - the sixth consecutive month of falls and the longest such run in almost three years.

Some shoppers are tightening their belts, as industry data on Tuesday showed the market share of Britain’s four biggest supermarkets falling in response to growing sales at German discount chains Aldi and Lidl.

Relatively cheap online fashion retailer ASOS (ASOS.L) also revised up growth forecasts on Tuesday, in part due to stronger demand after it froze its prices despite higher import costs following last year’s fall in the pound.",UK third-quarter retail sales growth weakest in four years as inflation bites,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-retail/uk-third-quarter-retail-sales-growth-weakest-in-four-years-as-inflation-bites-idUKKBN1CO0ZG

It is conducting drills with the South Korean navy involving 40 warships deployed in a line stretching from the Yellow Sea west of the peninsula into the Sea of Japan.

“The dangerous and aggressive behavior by North Korea concerns everybody in the world,” Rear Admiral Marc Dalton, commander of the Reagan’s strike group, said in the carrier’s hangar as war planes taxied on the flight deck above.

“We have made it clear with this exercise, and many others, that we are ready to defend the Republic of Korea.”

The Reagan’s presence in the region, coupled with recent military pressure by Washington on Pyongyang, including B1-B strategic bomber flights over the Korean peninsula, comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s first official visit to Asia, set to start in Japan on Nov. 5, with South Korea to follow.

North Korea has slammed the warship gathering as a “rehearsal for war”. It comes as senior Japanese, South Korean and U.S. diplomats meet in Seoul to discuss a diplomatic way forward backed up by U.N. sanctions.

The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since 2006. The most stringent include a ban on coal, iron ore and seafood exports that aim at halting a third of North Korea’s $3 billion of annual exports.

On Monday, Kim In Ryong, North Korea’s deputy U.N. envoy, told a U.N. General Assembly committee the Korean peninsula situation had reached a touch-and-go point and a nuclear war could break out at any moment.

A series of weapons tests by Pyongyang, including its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 and two missile launches over Japan, has stoked tension in East Asia.

A Russian who returned from a visit to Pyongyang has said the regime is preparing to test a missile it believes can reach the U.S. west coast.

On Sunday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said President Donald Trump had instructed him to continue diplomatic efforts to defuse tension with North Korea.

In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 a.m. deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence.

The war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest, cut growth prospects for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and rattled the euro.

“If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,” Puigdemont said.

Catalonia, which has a distinctive culture and language, triggered Spain’s biggest political crisis for decades with a secession bid it put to a referendum on Oct 1. Only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede, while opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The European Union declined to help mediate, saying the crisis was for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

“Member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation,” European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference during an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly. Some pro-independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the Catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character.

Rajoy plans to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 constitution, which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law.

A senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on Saturday and probably voted through the upper house Senate on Oct. 30, giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before Madrid takes control.

The regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally, call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate, or back down, although this is seen as highly unlikely.

“From the moment the measures are known, the regional government knows what’s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon,” the source said.

Spanish stocks, bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade, but recovered, a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that Madrid had the upper hand in the standoff.

LAW UNCLEAR

The terms of Article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region.

“The government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order, recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating,” government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said in a statement.

Rajoy’s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps. A spokesman for the Socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist Article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way.

Madrid’s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers, to a softer and more targeted approach, the government source said. Theoretically, the central administration could take control of the region’s finances and police, and call a snap election.

But some members of the Catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution, suggesting the stand-off could extend for at least several more days.

Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP party whose 10 deputies are vital to Puigdemont’s coalition, said dialogue with the Spanish state now looked impossible, and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence.

“From our point of view, the sooner this happens the better,” Riera told Reuters in the Catalan capital Barcelona.

Impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city. Merche, 55, who voted for secession in the referendum, said she was tired of the political to-and-fro.

“People want a resolution. Go for one thing or the other, but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work,” she said, rearranging lettuces on her market stall.

Puigdemont has already defied Rajoy once this week, when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks.

Rajoy says the Catalan government has repeatedly broken the law, including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, only to suspend it seconds later.

Puigdemont says a violent police crackdown during the referendum and arrests of pro-independence leaders on charges of sedition show the Spanish state has become authoritarian.",Spain to suspend Catalonia's autonomy in response to independence threat,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spain-to-suspend-catalonias-autonomy-in-response-to-independence-threat-idUSKBN1CN365

Or, as some conservatives fear, the far-left leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon be prime minister.","British politics are a terrible mess. But don’t blame populism, however that’s defined. If anything, blame democracy – however that’s organized.

Last June’s referendum result on Brexit was close – 52 percent voted for Britain to leave the European Union; 48 percent to stay – but indisputable. Unlike in the U.S., no one believes that Russia altered the outcome. And this was a vote not to “drain the swamp” of Westminster, but to strengthen it. As Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs who campaigned enthusiastically for Brexit as the head of the “Vote Leave” campaign put it, the electors “wanted to restore genuine democratic government and take back control of the laws that govern them.”

Brexit is what happened when people were given a voice. No doubt that many who voted for it were uninformed; some were voting for a better yesterday; many were fearful of the effects of mass immigration – especially of Muslims. A few Britons didn’t want any foreigners at all. But above all, they wanted to “take back control,” and believed that political power should reside in the British parliament – which is comprehensible in its workings and dignified by centuries of existence – rather than in a series of institutions in Brussels, confusing in their overlapping and largely mysterious operations.

No matter that those with more sophisticated views of governance saw the desire as foolish: “an attempt to create a romantic idea of what Britain could be like out of the EU,” said the Liverpool University political scientist Andrew Crines. The majority wanted politics to be at least within their understanding, their representatives – liked or loathed – familiar.

It is this view that has rumbled along beneath the surface for most of the 44 years in which Britain has been a member of the European Union; it is what Prime Minster Theresa May meant in her Brexit speech to politicians in Florence on Friday, when she said that the EU “never felt to us like an integral part of our national story.”

That feeling was quiescent at times, especially during the 13 years of a Labour government, from 1997 to 2010, fevered at others. It was most turbulent during Conservative administrations: the last three Conservative Prime Ministers – Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990) John Major (1990-1997) and David Cameron (2010-2016) all lost power because they were fatally weakened by the internal argument on Europe within their party. No one gives Theresa May much hope of avoiding the Brussels curse which has wreaked so much damage on her predecessors.

The British prime minister is seen as someone clinging on to power, at the mercy of fellow ministers who could, at any time, bring her down. The most ambitious of these, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, has revealed his desire to lead his country most clearly. In an article in the Telegraph, he lauded the UK in the most elevated rhetoric employed in the Brexit cause, largely devoid of his trademark jests, expressing a bounding belief that “we can become the greatest country on earth.”

Giving only the briefest mention to his prime minister, he took over 4000 words to make the vision of a liberated Britain his own, striking a Churchillian pose with “I do not underestimate the scale of the task ahead as we take back control of our destiny” – the kind of rhetoric wholly absent from May’s cautious, if more precise, speeches.

Her Florence speech, clearly something of a compromise between her cabinet factions, vague on many details, nevertheless laid down a process, if not a destination: honoring commitments (that is, probably a 20 billion GBP – about $27 billion – payment to the EU), adopting new laws to protect the existing rights of European citizens living in the UK and passing through a two-year transition to give both sides, especially the UK, time to adjust to a customized relationship not based on the trade pacts which other, non-EU countries, have with the EU.

May’s all-but-impossible job is – as she interprets it – to keep a party and a cabinet with many Remainers in it relatively united, and to retain at least the acquiescence of the senior diplomats and civil servants, of the Bank of England and the main institutions of state, many – probably most – of whom believe Brexit to be most grievously self-wounding, consigning Britain not to greatness but to marginality.

A combination of images shows Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaking at the Complesso Santa Maria Novella, Florence, Italy September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Jeff J Mitchell/Pool

Speaking in Washington earlier this week, Mark Carney, the Canadian who leads the Bank of England, warned of higher inflation, interest rate rises and slower growth, and forecast that Britain – unlike the other advanced countries – would be “an example of deglobalization, not globalization.”

The former close aide to the prime minister, Nick Timothy – whom May was told to fire after nearly losing the election in June – wrote ahead of May’s Florence speech that Chancellor Philip Hammond, was “maneuvering” towards a partial Brexit, failing to promote its advantages and, in his behind-the-scenes arguments with Boris Johnson, playing “games” with the future of the country.

These “maneuvers,” and many more at every level of government, are deployed around the office of an embattled prime minister who, with a relatively modest personality (for a senior politician), has no powerful public presence with which to offset the impression of barely-controlled chaos. Meanwhile, every institution at home and abroad affected by Brexit – there are many – call loudly and daily for a certainty at which the government has not yet arrived, and an easy transition which it cannot guarantee.

In a much-discussed book, “The Road to Somewhere”, the journalist David Goodhart (disclosure: a former Financial Times colleague, and a friend, of this columnist) sees in British society a widening split. On one side there are those who are anywhere people: at home in a globalizing world, with liberal views, enthusiastically pro-European, scornful of rootedness - “progressive individualists.” On the other, somewhere people, much more rooted in family and local work and friendships, not (in the main) bigoted but slow to adapt, worried by too-rapid change - “decent populists.”

Admitting that each side usually shares aspects of the other, he argues that the somewhere people have lost out in status, income and visibility in the last few decades, to the point where they often tell pollsters that they barely recognize the country they live in. Much more strongly represented in the working and lower middle class, less often university-educated, generally older than the anywheres, they still are the largest bloc in the country – and in the referendum, their pent-up vexations were allowed a release.

Their decision was probably not a wise act, but it was a thoroughly democratic one.

WASHINGTON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Global bank watchdogs are acting as a line of defense against a U.S. deregulatory push. The U.S. Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the post-crisis bank resolution regime, as some Republicans urge. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it’s ditched.

What’s known as orderly liquidation authority was established to avoid confusion if a complex financial institution fails, like Lehman Brothers did a decade ago. Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp the power to resolve bank holding companies, systemically important non-banks and other financial firms, and set up a fund to pay for the associated costs. The FDIC would initially borrow from the Treasury, and recoup the expenses with a fee imposed on big banks.

Some congressional Republicans decry this arrangement as another taxpayer-funded bailout. They have introduced bills to eliminate OLA and replace it with an improved bankruptcy code. The criticisms prompted President Donald Trump in April to order Treasury to review the OLA, and assess whether bankruptcy was a better method.

The U.S. debate ignores the global nature of big banks and the role international regulators play. The FDIC-supported method would resolve a firm at the holding company level, eliminating the need for each division - including overseas units - to have their own wind-down plans. Overseas watchdogs would defer to U.S. regulators and work in close cooperation with them. Bankruptcy judges don’t have those relationships and the process, even with improvements, would be too slow to handle the fast-paced chaos of a large, failing bank.

Overseas regulators have smartly worked to get ahead of the decision, warning that without OLA, U.S. banks’ overseas subsidiaries could be subject to higher capital requirements, restructuring and ringfencing. Wall Street also supports maintaining the liquidation authority. Despite Trump’s threats to gut Dodd-Frank, Steven Mnuchin’s Treasury Department so far has been level-headed in its recommendations for revising bank regulations and rules overseeing capital markets. The threat from global watchdogs is another reason to discount the odds of a major rollback of financial rules.",Breakingviews - Global watchdogs may curb U.S. deregulatory push,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-regulation-breakingviews/breakingviews-global-watchdogs-may-curb-u-s-deregulatory-push-idUSKBN1CN2FH

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders said on Thursday they looked forward to seeing proposals on taxing online giants by early 2018 but in a nod to concerns from countries like Ireland said EU efforts had to be in line with work under way at a global level.

European countries are split over whether online companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon should pay more tax, with smaller EU members such as Ireland and Luxembourg - which host many online businesses - worried that taxes would hurt their competitiveness without a global solution.

Countries like Italy and France on the other hand are frustrated by the low tax rates online giants pay by re-routing profits through low-rate countries and insist the EU should go it alone if the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States and Japan, is unable to reach an agreement on a global solution.

Meeting for an EU summit, the leaders said in their conclusions that they looked forward to “appropriate (European) Commission proposals by early 2018.”

However they referred to the need to ensure a “global level-playing field in line with the work currently under way at the OECD”, a change from earlier draft summit conclusions which did not mention “global” or link the OECD work to EU efforts.

An EU diplomat said French President Emmanuel Macron - who has led the charge for more taxation of digital giants - was told to wait for OECD proposals in April 2018.

Last month the European Commission outlined three options for taxing internet companies: taxing the turnover rather than the profits of digital firms, putting a levy on online ads and imposing a withholding tax on payments to internet firms.

In the longer term the EU wants to change existing taxation rights to make sure digital firms with large operations but no physical presence in a given country pay taxes there instead of being allowed to re-route their profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

The EU wants member states to reach a compromise by December, will then base its proposals on what they agree to, and will also send those proposals to the OECD.

However, the EU faces the prospect of countries opposed to the measures blocking the move as states have a veto on tax matters.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) said demand from mobile device makers is likely to push October-December revenue growth to 10 percent from three months prior, in a quarter when client Apple Inc begins sales of its iPhone X.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker also expects annual revenue growth of 5 to 10 percent for the next few years, and capital expenditure slightly above $10 billion, executives said at an earnings briefing on Thursday.

TSMC earlier reported a 7.1 percent fall in third-quarter profit, a slightly milder decline than analysts estimated. Revenue rose 1.5 percent, marginally beating the firm’s forecast.

“Even though demand was slightly dampened by supply chain inventory reduction, our customers’ third-quarter growth was largely healthy,” said co-Chief Executive Officer Mark Liu.

The results come soon after TSMC named Liu as successor in June to retiring Chairman Morris Chang - widely regarded as the father of Taiwan’s chip industry - leaving C.C. Wei as sole CEO. They also come days before TSMC celebrates its 30th anniversary and about a week before iPhone X pre-orders begin.

Demand for increasingly capable smartphones as well as for servers for cloud computing has seen chipmakers’ share prices surge this year, with TSMC jumping 68 percent. Overall global chip market growth this year will likely be 16 percent, TSMC said.

But competition is set to increase. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world’s biggest memory chip maker, plans to triple its share of the contract chipmaking market within five years. There is also the threat from mainland China which is fostering a domestic chip industry.

“In terms of a lot of fabs (fabrication plants) in mainland China, we don’t like it but we are very competitive. We’ll continue to compete of course and maintain our market share,” Wei said at the earnings briefing.

Profit was T$89.93 billion ($2.98 billion) in July-September versus the T$88.19 billion average of 21 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue was $8.32 billion and operating margin was 38.9 percent.

TSMC forecast October-December revenue at $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with an operating margin of 37 to 39 percent.

During the quarter, on Nov. 3, Apple will begin shipping the iPhone X which is widely expected to carry TSMC-made chips. The device follows the recently launched iPhone 8 whose sales are reportedly slower than those of predecessors.

For all of 2017, TSMC said revenue growth will likely be close to the high end of its 5 to 10 percent target range.

The firm also said 2017 will mark a milestone in annual capital spending as it raised its forecast by 8 percent to $10.8 billion, mainly to accelerate capacity build-up of 7 nanometer chip manufacturing technology.",TSMC sees on-quarter revenue growth at 10 pct ahead of iPhone X launch,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-results/tsmc-sees-on-quarter-revenue-growth-at-10-pct-ahead-of-iphone-x-launch-idUSKBN1CO0HW

By Thursday, the California fires had killed at least 23 people and destroyed 3,500 homes or businesses. Those numbers are likely to increase once the fire is suppressed and officials can conduct more thorough searches.

In August, fires raging in a remote region of British Columbia choked Vancouver and Seattle with smoke. That month, more than a million acres in Montana burned, forcing schoolchildren to stay inside. In September, terrifying images circulated of fires smoldering in the background of everyday scenes like an airport tarmac in Burbank, California and a golf course in Oregon.

The toll of these fires is the product of bad land use, especially over-development at the perimeter of forests, and subsequent fire suppression efforts that protect those developments at the expense of a vital natural cycle. If U.S. and Canadian authorities don’t adopt the right policies, wildfires will only become more deadly.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

Following a wet and snowy winter in the West, many hoped this year would see minimal wildfires. But a hot, dry summer that set heat records even in normally-chilly San Francisco destroyed that optimism. This year is no fluke: large wildfires have become more common and damaging in recent years. In 2015, Washington State saw its worst wildfire season on record, including the largest fire in state history. In 2013, a rapidly escalating wildfire in Arizona killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad. Climate scientists predict that global warming will make wildfires worse as less mountain snowpack and hotter, drier summers conspire to create more conflagrations.

The issue is most acute in the western areas of North America because the region’s rapidly growing population, proliferation of rural vacation homes, and suburban sprawl means more and more people are building too close to forests. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the U.S. population living in what’s known as the “wildland-urban interface,” the locations where homes and businesses butt up against a fire-prone natural environment – think of a subdivision in an Arizona canyon or a cluster of mountain cabins in Colorado surrounded by thick forest – has ballooned by 720 percent, from 25 to 140 million people. According to the U.S. Forest Service, 60 percent of new home construction since 1990 is located in this dangerous zone. As Montana Public Radio, reporting on the wildfire season, described it, “There’s an unquenchable demand for home construction in and near wildfire-prone areas.”

While heavily-forested landscapes are precisely the draw for constructing a cute cabin in the woods or relocating to a small town in the shadow of a tree-lined ridge, they are also increasingly dangerous places for people to live and towns to grow. When human lives and property are under threat, state and local jurisdictions have an obligation to respond. That costs a lot of money – this year has already proven to be the most expensive wildfire season in Montana since 1999, adjusted for inflation – and risks the lives of courageous firefighters.

Just like the need for stricter land-use regulations in the wake of coastal flooding from this season’s devastating hurricanes, it’s time for state and local governments to stop allowing people to live cheek-by-jowl with wildfire-prone vegetation and hold accountable those who take the risk. After all, when local firefighting budgets are exhausted, as they quickly are in heavy fire seasons, the U.S. Forest Service picks up the slack at a cost to all taxpayers. Even worse, voters in some areas with a history of past fires have rejected special assessments to pay for the extra fire prevention and response measures that their lifestyle requires, forcing the cost onto their neighbors who don’t live in fire zones.

Currently, just two states – California and Oregon – have mandatory mitigation measures that require structures in fire-prone zones to be built with fire-resistant materials and homeowners to clear vegetation a certain radius away from the building to prevent fire from engulfing a structure.

Stricter rules are a good first step, but the bigger problem is the people who are living near wildlands in the first place. National Geographic reports that the number of housing units within half a mile of a national forest grew from 484,000 in 1940 to 1.8 million in 2000.

Wildfires serve an important role in ecosystems, clearing underbrush and debris and allowing healthy trees to flourish. When more people live in or near forests, firefighters are ordered to suppress blazes near those houses, disrupting the natural wildfire cycle and making future fires even worse by building up the store of dry vegetation.

Low-density, sprawling development is the chief culprit. Outward expansion happened around every major U.S. city, but the consequences are the most severe in the fire-prone western United States. Many of the major cities with the lowest population densities, such as San Diego, Salt Lake City and Phoenix, are found in the West. Even supposedly eco-friendly West Coast burgs like Portland and Seattle are more spread out than East Coast cities such as Boston or Philadelphia. “In the last half century, about one-fifth of the American people have moved into flame zones, insufficiently aware of the perils awaiting them and inadvertently testing the limits of nature’s tolerance,” writes former National Park Service director Roger Kennedy in “Wildfire and Americans: How to Save Lives, Property, and Your Tax Dollars.”

The West’s historical draw may be as an escape valve from crowded eastern cities, but it’s time to retire that outdated narrative. Westerners who aren’t working the land need to live in dense housing in or near cities, not on big lots out at the edge of a wild forest. There are risks even if that forested hillside is close to the central city – like the Oakland hills, where California’s deadliest fire raged in 1991. Perversely, homeowners there used insurance payouts to build even bigger houses in the hills, though thankfully insurance companies are finally wising up and even refusing to re-insure in fire-prone areas.

The forest should be for visiting and maybe staying overnight in a tent, not for living in permanently. When the smoke from British Columbia made life unbearable in my Seattle apartment over the summer, I retreated to the cleaner air of Olympic National Park. The beautiful temperate rainforest would be a heavenly place for a cabin if I could afford one, but the responsible course of action is to follow the old hiker’s maxim: take only pictures, leave only footprints.",Commentary: There’s a way to reduce the wildfire toll.

Bush decried “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade on Thursday in a New York speech that appeared to be a sweeping, thinly veiled critique of President Donald Trump.

Bush, 71, used a rare public address to discuss nationalism, racial divisions and Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election, all flashpoints of his fellow Republican’s nine-month White House tenure. He did not mention Trump by name.

“Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them,” Bush said at the Bush Institute’s National Forum on Freedom, Free Markets and Security.

Trump has used nicknames to demean opponents, such as “Crooked Hillary” for Democrat Hillary Clinton and, more recently, “Liddle” Bob Corker for a Republican senator who dared to challenge him.

Bush, president from 2001 to 2009, emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade, two policy areas that Trump has cracked down on while in office.

“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,” Bush said.

“We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism.”

Asked whether the speech was aimed at Trump, a spokesman for Bush said the long-planned remarks echoed themes the 43rd president had discussed for years.

“The themes President Bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades,” said Bush spokesman Freddy Ford.

Bush touted U.S. alliances abroad, something Trump has called into question, and he denounced white supremacy, which critics accused Trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year.

CRITICIZES RUSSIA

In the speech, Bush described a decline in public confidence in U.S. institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs.

“Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,” Bush said. “We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty.”

Trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that Democratic former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Obama, Trump’s predecessor, was born in the U.S. state of Hawaii.

Bush said Americans were the heirs of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, as well as civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.

“This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American,” he said. “It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed.”

Trump has had a rocky relationship with the Bush family. He belittled former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who was an early opponent of Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, and has criticized George W. Bush for the war in Iraq and for presiding over the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

Bush said globalization could not be wished away “any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution.”

He also had harsh words for Russia and seemed to take aim at Trump for playing down Moscow’s intervention in the U.S. election.

“According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy,” he said.

“Foreign aggressions, including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence, should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home.”","Bush takes veiled swipe at Trump, defends immigration and trade",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bush/bush-takes-veiled-swipe-at-trump-slams-bullying-and-prejudice-idUSKBN1CO2VG

Investors have been anxious to hear who President Donald Trump will pick as the nominee. A decision like Powell would likely be a continuation of the current stock market-friendly monetary policy that has helped fuel the market’s more than eight-year bull run.

Stocks had been recovering from early losses for much of the afternoon but the S&P 500 and Dow were still a tad lower just before the Powell report.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I can’t observe any other reason for why we ended up.”

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of (current Fed Chair) Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove ... and, with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber-accommodative monetary policy, as more welcome than the alternative,” he said.

Powell was among several names circulating as possible picks, including Yellen. Others include Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

The White House on Wednesday said Trump will announce his decision on the matter in the “coming days.”

Tech shares were among the day’s biggest drags, led by Apple (AAPL.O), which fell 2.4 percent in its biggest daily percentage decline since Aug. 10 as doubts about its double 2017 iPhone release strategy weighed on investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 5.44 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 23,163.04, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.84 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,605.07.

Stocks have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

The day also marked the 30th anniversary of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Most traders see a repeat of the crash as unlikely because of modern trading technology and other changes.

Investors also took profits in the broader tech sector, which has had a strong run so far this year, gaining about 30 percent and helping drive the market’s recent record run. The tech index .SPLRCT was down 0.4 percent on the day.

Weighing on the market early as well was some disappointing news on the earnings front.

United Airlines (UAL.N) tumbled 12.1 percent, weighing on other airlines stocks after the third-largest U.S. carrier’s profit fell due to flight cancellations during the hurricane season. American Airlines (AAL.O) fell 1 percent.

Shares of eBay (EBAY.O) were down 1.8 percent a day after it reported results.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.

Despite eight easing moves, however, growth is stuck at 5 percent, lagging China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam. Consumer spending was down an average 1.1 percent in July and August year-on-year.

Foreign investors are heading for the door, dumping more than $2 billion of shares in the third quarter – the biggest ejection of foreign funds from Indonesian stocks since the 2013 Federal Reserve “taper tantrum.”

The problem is President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, hasn’t fulfilled bold pledges to accelerate structural upgrades, implement projects to improve roads, bridges, ports and power grids, and create well paid jobs. Nor has he eliminated a current-account deficit that stood at $4.9 billion in the second quarter - another sore point. The World Bank now lists the rupiah among Asia’s most vulnerable currencies.

To be sure, Indonesia is not on the verge of crisis. Jokowi deserves credit for increasing accountability and transparency since taking office, and he has pushed a successful amnesty tax plan to spark investment at home. He also has kept up predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s anti-corruption campaign. In the last year alone, Jakarta moved up to 36th place from 41st in the World Economic Forum’s latest global competitiveness index.

But if Jokowi wants Indonesia to join the Group of Seven by 2030, as consultancy McKinsey predicts, he must get much more out of the two years he has left in office. That means implementing an ambitious $350 billion infrastructure programme, upping investments in education and training, and attracting more multinationals. The latter requires he curb the forces of economic nationalism at home.

The recent tussle between the government and Freeport-McMoRan sheds light on why resource-rich Indonesia isn’t pulling in more foreign direct investment. In August, the U.S. company tentatively agreed to transfer a 51 percent stake in Grasberg mine to Jakarta amid a months-long worker strike. Unsurprisingly, in the second quarter mining FDI fell by the most since 2012.

Monetary easing isn’t enough. Two-hundred basis points of rate cuts since January 2016 haven’t ignited household or business spending or quickened top-line growth. Jokowi needs to simplify investment rules, police a graft-prone bureaucracy and streamline state enterprises. Reducing bottlenecks would cheer boardrooms from Samsung to Toyota to Unilever. So would tackling land, labor and tax laws. There’s no time to waste as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens trade wars and favours a weaker dollar.

The partnership is part of a trend by tech companies to connect with the U.S. Midwest following last November’s surprise election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. Trump was carried largely by rural states that embraced his criticisms of globalization and admonishments of Silicon Valley for what he described as an overreliance on immigrant workers.

For Microsoft, the outreach efforts serve as a way to connect with folks across the United States, said Brad Smith, the tech company’s chief legal officer.

“We are probably not going to find the technology breakthrough for the future of farming in downtown San Francisco,“ Smith told Reuters. ”We’re much more likely to find it in Green Bay, Wisconsin.”

Through the partnership, known as TitletownTech, the Packers and Microsoft will each contribute $5 million to invest in startups from around Wisconsin. This is part of a larger initiative by Microsoft called TechSpark to form similar partnerships in North Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.

Microsoft in July also committed itself to use television broadcast spectrum to bring broadband internet to 2 million rural Americans within five years.

“For communities like ours in the manufacturing belt, this is going to get us to where we need to be in order to be competitive well into the future,” Ed Policy, Green Bay Packers general counsel, said in an interview on Wednesday.

TechSpark is a long-term strategy Microsoft hopes will yield new customers, new employees and benefit more Americans, Smith said.

The origins of what became TechSpark occurred the day after Trump’s Nov. 8 election win, when Smith wrote a blog post saying Microsoft needed to “promote inclusive economic growth that helps everyone move forward.”

Microsoft is not alone in its outreach efforts to the American heartland.

So far in 2017, Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has traveled to U.S. states he had not previously visited. Similarly, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook in April spoke to his alma mater Auburn University in Alabama, and the iPhone maker has said it will invest $1.3 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, to build a new data center and an additional $1 billion to expand its data center in Reno, Nevada.

Apple in May also announced a $1 billion fund for U.S. manufacturing programs. Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) in September announced plans to open a second headquarters away from Seattle, promising to bring $5 billion in investments to the chosen community.

”The 2016 presidential election was a wake-up call for many Americans, especially those in the ‘bubble’ of coastal cities,” said Jessica Alter, co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, a nonprofit formed to promote tech worker participation in progressive and moderate political campaigns in local U.S. elections.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Amid a U.S. push to cut United Nations peacekeeping costs, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday he hoped the U.N. Security Council would agree to send an extra 900 troops to protect civilians in Central African Republic.

Guterres, who will visit Central African Republic next week, told reporters that while peacekeepers had “helped avert the worst” when mass atrocities were being committed in the country five years ago, the situation remained “very troubling.”

“Across the country, communal tensions are growing. Violence is spreading. And the humanitarian situation is deteriorating,” Guterres said. “There is a need to increase the capacity of our troops in Central African Republic to protect civilians.”

“I am convinced there will be a very positive understanding of all the members of the Security Council, including the United States of America, in relation to this,” he said.

Thousands have died and a fifth of Central Africans have fled a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias.

Although unrest has since subsided, fighting has spiked this year and the United Nations warned that ethnic fighting could descend again into a much larger conflict.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in 2014 and the Security Council is due to renew the mandate for the mission of more than 12,000 troops and police by mid-November. In a report to the council on Tuesday, Guterres recommended an extra 900 troops.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has led a push to cut peacekeeping costs and is reviewing each operation as annual mandates come up for renewal by the Security Council. President Donald Trump wants to cap the U.S. share of the peacekeeping bill at 25 percent, down from 28.5 percent, a level he says is “unfair.”

The United States is a veto-wielding member of the council, along with Britain, France, Russia and China. There are currently more than a dozen peacekeeping missions with a total annual budget of more than $7.3 billion.

Guterres has pledged to make U.N. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.

U.N. peacekeepers in Central African Republic have also been dogged by allegations of sexual abuse that the world body has been working to address.

One week after suffering a staggering collision with Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico is in the throes of an agonizing humanitarian disaster.

The storm left at least 16 dead and the entire island without power; most people won’t get their lights back on anytime soon. The cascading effects have been devastating. More than half of residents remain without drinking water. Hospitals cannot function. Supermarket shelves are empty and few gas stations are open. Communication networks are crippled, and first responders are struggling to make contact with residents in remote or heavily affected areas. Credit cards are useless, and ATMs are out of service.

We know how to do better and we can do better. Nobody should die because the power went out.

We need a dedicated national effort to fortify our electrical grids so that they can get back online much more quickly after inevitable, and increasingly severe, extreme weather events. Natural disasters happen, but often the catastrophes that follow are man-made. And when it comes to the electricity system—the lynchpin upon which so much of our society relies—widespread, long-lasting power outages can quickly devolve into nightmares all their own. Just a few weeks ago, 11 senior citizens died in Florida following prolonged heat exposure due to power outages in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma. Similar catastrophes were suffered in the wakes of many other earlier storms, including Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.

The centralized electricity grid is widely vulnerable to threats, both natural and manmade. Flooding can submerge and damage equipment, as it did throughout the Northeast during Sandy; heavy winds can rip down trees and power lines, as was seen throughout Florida from Irma; and extreme heat and forest fires can wreak havoc on transmission lines. Climate change stands to escalate these threats, by contributing to higher seas, more intense storms, worsening wildfires and extended heat waves.

That’s why the focus must be on electricity grid resilience. It’s impractical and impossible to stop all outages from occurring. But it is possible to design the system such that when the power does inevitably fail, fewer people are affected from the outset and power is restored more quickly for the rest.

In Florida, policymakers directed the state’s utilities to “storm harden” their systems following the devastating 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. One decade and several billion ratepayer dollars later, Irma gave people a chance to see their increased utility bills at work.

The result: an astounding 6.7 million customers—or nearly two out of every three in the state—were plunged into darkness. Surely evidence of a failed approach, right?

Not quite. When it comes to the cascading failures arising from widespread outages, length of the blackout is a key factor in the severity of the impact. Even though all those Floridians lost power after, the utilities were able to get over one million back online overnight, and millions more restored within a few days with help from crews from across America.

In Florida, that pivot toward improving recovery times has meant, for one, simple upgrades, like replacing thousands of wooden utility poles with concrete that can better withstand hurricane-force winds. In the aftermath of Irma, even though crashing trees and flying debris ripped down power lines, restoration times were vastly improved by a reduced need to replace fallen poles.

Other initiatives can be more technologically complex. For example, by installing sensors and grid automation throughout the system, utilities can pinpoint when and where an outage has occurred, and re-route systems to reduce the number of people without power. Similarly, flood monitoring equipment can alert a utility when critical infrastructure is at risk of inundation, allowing the equipment to be pre-emptively turned off to improve post-storm repair times.

Tackling a problem this big, however, is impossible for each utility to do alone. Complicating the push for a more resilient electricity system is the fact that proposed interventions can be expensive, and investment dollars are limited. Additionally, the federal government has offered insufficient assistance, leaving states, cities and territories to largely fend for themselves, even though investing in a more resilient system now can reduce the costs of future relief and recovery efforts.

Utilities’ limited funds mean there are trade-offs, so opportunities must be carefully weighed against one another. But the costs of prolonged outages are far-reaching and challenging to quantify, and resiliency metrics are hard to define and even harder to compare. Efforts must also align with other priorities, especially as the power sector undergoes an unparalleled transition to clean and distributed renewable resources.

The fact also remains that some services are far too critical—drinking water, first responders, communications—and some populations, such as the elderly, disabled, or low-income, to tolerate even a day without power. For these people and services, a resilient grid is not enough.

Diesel generators, which have long-served a backup role when disasters hit, are expensive, heavily polluting, and prone to failure due to infrequent use. And as the long and frustrating lines following recent storms have made clear, maintaining steady access to fuel in the aftermath of a severe storm can be challenging, if not impossible. Microgrids powered by solar and storage, on the other hand, are more reliable during times of crisis, better for health and the environment, and increasingly affordable. This is thanks to lower costs of solar and storage technologies, as well as the fact that these systems can provide onsite power, generating benefits all year, not just during extreme weather events.

So what does this mean for Puerto Rico? Reports suggest parts of the island could remain without power for months, potentially impacting millions of people. This is unacceptable.

Now, as a country, we must pool together resources for a swift response to curtail the devastating crisis at hand. But we must also ensure that as the decimated power grid is pieced back together, this catastrophe—and the far too many that preceded it—were not suffered in vain. The electricity system must be rebuilt for a climate-resilient, clean-energy supporting future, not as a replica of its brittle and underinvested past.",Commentary: How we could have prevented some of Puerto Rico’s misery,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcnamara-electricity-commentary/commentary-how-we-could-have-prevented-some-of-puerto-ricos-misery-idUSKCN1C42ER

SOWETO, South Africa (Reuters) - A narrowing current account deficit, improving economy and stable inflation should help South Africa avoid credit rating cuts in November, central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said in an interview, playing down concerns over the most recent cabinet reshuffle.

Growth in Africa’s most industrialised economy has slowed to a near standstill in recent years, hit by corruption and a lack of progress on sorely needed reforms.

Bitter infighting within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has also sapped investor confidence and thwarted efforts to create jobs and reduce widespread poverty.

Kganyago and Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba met the ratings agencies on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings last week in Washington, hoping to convince investors that the economy is on the mend despite the tensions in the ANC.

“On the engagements we had with the ratings agencies, I think we were able to deal with the credit concerns that they had raised,” Kganyago told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday in the Soweto township near Johannesburg.

“The current account deficit is no longer 7.2 percent of gross domestic product. It is now around 2 percent. Inflation is not outside of the target, and it’s projected to remain so over the next two years, so you can’t say we would be forced to tighten monetary policy and thus choke growth,” Kganyago said.

The central bank targets inflation of between 3 and 6 percent. Despite a slight rise in September to 5.1 percent, Kganyago sees price growth remaining within the target range for the next two years.

The three major international ratings agencies - Moody‘s, Fitch and S&P Global - all downgraded South Africa’s sovereign credit rating after President Jacob Zuma fired respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle in March.

Fitch and S&P now rate South Africa’s foreign-currency rating in sub-investment, or “junk”, territory. But only Fitch has the country’s local-currency rating in junk.

But with Moody’s and S&P expected to review South Africa’s local-currency credit rating in November, some foreign investors are nervous.

If both downgrade the country to junk, that could trigger massive outflows from South African bonds of up to $12 billion.

Kganyago has headed the South African Reserve Bank since 2014, and his team has been praised for its credible response to high inflation and low growth amid the political turmoil.

Despite Kganyago’s positive assessment, one of his deputies, Kuben Naidoo, said earlier this month that the risk of further credit downgrades was “quite significant”.

CABINET RESHUFFLE

President Zuma launched a second cabinet reshuffle in seven months on Tuesday, appointing a close associate to oversee a big nuclear power deal, and potentially adding to political instability ahead of an ANC leadership election in December.

Kganyago said he did not see the reshuffle as a reason to change the country’s rating, but he said it was critical that the government tackle the atmosphere of uncertainty that had gripped the country.

“Uncertainty can’t be a new normal. We’ve got to clear the uncertainty, restore consumer and business confidence, deal with the credit concerns. We have got the ability to put this economy back on a growth trajectory,” he said.

Ratings agencies have warned that a shortfall in government revenues and growing public debt threaten South Africa’s ratings, but Kganyago played down those concerns.

“Even if government misses their revenue target, you are not going to see fiscal deficits like we saw at the time of the recession in 2008, when the deficit shot up to 6.8 percent,” he said.

The central bank governor, whose term expires in 2019, also said concerns among some investors that South Africa could tighten currency controls in the event of further ratings downgrades were wide of the mark, saying there was “no willingness from our side to do that”.",South Africa should avoid rating cuts in Nov: central bank chief,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CO1SM-OZABS

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, urged voters in New Jersey to reject the “politics of division” by supporting Democrats in next month’s state elections.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama said New Jersey could send a powerful signal about the type of politics it wants by voting for Democrat Phil Murphy in the Nov. 7 governor race.

“You’re going to send a message to the country and send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division, we are rejecting a politics of fear, that we are embracing a politics that says everybody counts,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark that chanted: “Four more years.”

It was the first of two public appearances by Obama on Thursday on behalf of Democratic candidates for governor. He will appear later in Richmond, Virginia. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding elections for governor this year.

Those contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can turn the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The two governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could be a preview of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Trump’s combative style and inflammatory comments have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

But in New Jersey, Obama focused on urging supporters to turn out their friends and families to vote. Democrats hope Obama can help bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

‘CAN‘T TAKE ELECTION FOR GRANTED’

Opinion polls show Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the New Jersey lieutenant governor, who is hindered by the unpopularity in the state of Trump and Republican Governor Chris Christie.

But Obama said no one should assume a victory is in the cards, making an indirect reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

“You can’t take this election or any election for granted. I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said.

Obama will appear on Thursday night in the political battleground of Virginia, which is viewed as a potential bellwether. Opinion polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

(This October 18 story has been refiled to fix dateline, amend headline and first paragraph)

ANGOOR ADDA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan is betting that a pair of nine-foot chain-link fences topped with barbed wire will stop incursions by Islamist militants from Afghanistan, which opposes Islamabad’s plans for a barrier along the disputed frontier.

Pakistan plans to fence up most of the 2,500 km (1,500 mile) frontier despite Kabul’s protests that the barrier would divide families and friends along the Pashtun tribal belt straddling the colonial-era Durand Line drawn up by the British in 1893.

Pakistan’s military estimates that it will need about 56 billion rupees ($532 million) for the project, while there are also plans to build 750 border forts and employ high-tech surveillance systems to prevent militants crossing.

In the rolling hills of the Angoor Adda village in South Waziristan, part of Pakistan’s restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), three rolls of barbed wire are sandwiched in the six-foot gap between the chain-link fences.

“(The fence) is a paradigm change. It is an epoch shift in the border control management,” said a Pakistani army officer in command of South Waziristan during a presentation to foreign media on Wednesday.

“There will not be an inch of international border (in South Waziristan) which shall not remain under our observation.”

Pakistan’s military has so far fenced off about 43 km of the frontier, starting with the most violence-prone areas in FATA, and is expected to recruit tens of thousands of new troops to man the border. It is not clear how long it will take to fence the entire boundary.

But Pakistan’s plans have also drawn criticism from across the border.

Gulab Mangal, governor of the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, told Reuters the wall will create “more hatred and resentment” between two neighbors and will do neither country any good.

“The fence will definitely create a lot of trouble for the people along the border on both sides but no wall or fence can separate these tribes,” he said.

“I urge the tribes to stand against this action.”

Pakistan has blamed Pakistani Taliban militants it says are based on Afghan soil for a spate of attacks at home over the past year, urging Kabul to eradicate “sanctuaries” for militants.

Afghanistan, in turn, accuses Islamabad of sheltering the leadership of the Afghan Taliban militants who are battling the Western-backed government in Kabul.

Both countries deny aiding militants, but relations between the two have soured in recent years. In May, the tension rose when 10 people were killed in two border villages in Baluchistan region.

The clashes occurred in so-called “divided villages”, where the Durand Line goes through the heart of the community, and where residents are now bracing for the fence to split their villages in two.

Pakistan’s previous attempts to build a fence failed about a decade ago and many doubt whether its possible to secure such a lengthy border.

But Pakistani army officials are undeterred by the scepticism and insist they will finish the job as the country’s security rests on this fence.

“By the time we are done, inshallah, we will be very sure of one thing: that nobody can cross this place,” said the Pakistani officer in charge of South Waziristan.","Pakistan, Afghanistan in angry tangle over border fence to keep out militants",https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-afghanistan/pakistan-afghanistan-in-angry-tangle-over-border-fence-to-keep-out-militants-idINKBN1CN25J

While the referendum is non-binding and the final vote tally may not be known for several days (though it will certainly be “yes” to independence), the true results of America’s decades of war in Iraq are already clear.

Along with the ongoing decimation of Iraq's Sunni population, the referendum means that in practice ""Iraq"" no longer exists. In its place is a Shiite state dominated by Iran, the de facto new nation of Kurdistan, and a shrinking population of Sunnis tottering between annihilation or reservation-like existence, depending on whether the United States uses the last of its influence to sketch out red lines or abandons the people to fate.

The waste comes in that a better version of a de facto tri-state Iraq was available in 2006. Every life lost (out of a million some, including 4,424 Americans), every dollar spent (in the trillions), and every unanticipated outcome suffered (rise of Islamic State, conflict in Syria, de-democratization of Turkey) since then has been unnecessary.

The post-World War One failure to create a Kurdish state resulted in 30 million Kurds scattered across modern Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq destroyed civil order in much of the area populated by those Kurds, and opened the door to Iranian influence. Iran and its Iraqi Shiite allies directed political violence against Iraqi Sunnis, paving the way for a Sunni protector, Islamic State, to move in.

When the American-trained (cost: $25 billion) Iraqi national army dropped its weapons and ran in 2014, and Shiite militias proved too weak to fill the breach, Obama reinserted the American military into Iraq, saving the Kurds, by then also under threat from Islamic State. The United States subsequently turned those Kurdish fighters loose in Iraq and later Syria against Islamic State. It was expediency over strategy; there was no force otherwise available in bulk.

And it kind of worked. In the short run.

The Kurds, with American help, blunted Islamic State’s progress. The problem was that while American diplomacy, the carrot-and-stick of aid, and the difficulty of maintaining long-distance logistics saw the Kurdish forces replaced by Shiite militias in some locations, the Kurds held on to their gains in the north, having in most instances displaced Iraqi Sunnis. Victorious and bloodied, the Kurds were not about to renounce their hard-earned gains.

The need for American arms did force Kurdish leaders to postpone an independence referendum, opposed by Washington, in 2014. Three years later, with Islamic State mortally weakened, Washington no longer holds sway over Kurdish ambitions. And although the Sept. 25 referendum has no legal force, Kurdish leaders will use the vote to push Baghdad for full autonomy. Donald Trump, the fifth consecutive American president to make war on Iraq, may be the last simply for lack of an Iraq to fight over.

The ground truth of autumn 2017 -- a Kurdistan in the north, a Shiite state in the south, a marginalized Sunni population out west -- is pretty much the deal that could have been had in 2006 when then-Senator Joe Biden proposed dividing Iraq into statelets. Biden wanted the United States to leave a ""residual force to combat terrorists and keep the [three] neighbors honest.” The Senate actually passed a resolution supporting Biden's idea.

It probably would have stabilized the region. The Middle East in 2006 was a very different place.

In 2006 Iran faced an American military as yet undamaged by an additional decade of grinding war. That military sat on both Iran's western border with Iraq and its eastern border with Afghanistan. The Iranian nuclear program was years behind where it is today. Syria was a relatively stable place under not-then-yet-enemy of the free world Bashar al-Assad; indeed, the British-educated Assad was initially seen as a minor reformer. Turkey was stable. Russia was not a major player in the Middle East.

With many of 2017's regional Pandoras still in the box, by Middle Eastern standards security in a divided Iraq would have been manageable via a modest American military presence.

Instead, events of the last decade mean the chance of Kurdish independence adding to regional stability is near zero. Iran, fearing that an independent Kurdish state could threaten its own sectarian balance, is already conducting maneuvers on the border, has canceled flights to and from Kurdistan, and will push its proxies in Baghdad to take action. Will Turkey, now politically distant from NATO, move to open war over disputed borderlands with Kurdistan? The Turkish parliament just extended its authorization for cross-border incursions for another year. Will Kurdish minorities in Turkey and Iran see this all as their moment to rise? Will Israel, which backs Kurdish independence in its search for regional allies, supply weapons?

In a best-case scenario, where everyone tacitly acknowledges Kurdistan while maintaining the status quo (as with Taiwan, which officially exists as a part of China even as it acts like an independent nation) there may be a measure of stability in the near term. Baghdad will talk tough even as it allows the Kurds a surprising amount of free reign -- for example, Baghdad has withdrawn its police from contested Kirkuk, leaving Kurdish forces fully in charge of the oil-rich city. Kurdistan already has full control over its own education, security, military, taxes, and diplomatic representation. Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government, has experimented with diplomatically vague language, saying “self-determination wouldn't mean a direct separation from Iraq.”

Darker predictions involve Syrian-Russian forces contesting Kurdish occupiers inside Syria. Iranian-backed Shiite militias have signaled plans to re-enter Kirkuk, and Turkey already has a running war with Kurdish fighters; tank maneuvers are ongoing with new threats gushing out of Ankara.

American policy has been a blurry gray for some time, calling for the referendum to be postponed without actually supporting or opposing independence. Traditionally the State Department favored a united Iraq somehow, while the Pentagon, with its history of in-the-dirt cooperation with Kurdish fighters stretching back to the 1991 no-fly zone and Operation Provide Comfort that essentially established the preliminary borders of Kurdistan, has been more sympathetic towards independence. The wording of America’s reaction (there has been no post-election statement issued as this is written) to the referendum could signal which part of government is making foreign policy in Iraq these days.

What seems clear is the American role going forward will be mostly limited to diplomacy, and that, regardless of who is carrying out the task, is not the country’s strong suit these days. There seems no appetite in Washington for large-scale troop redeployments, the kind of boots-on-the-ground necessary to decisively shape events.

The American military, which once could have played a role similar to its help in bringing peace to former Yugoslavia, instead will exist as a crumple zone among its own warring semi-allies.

Such a scenario exposes what might have been in 2006 when the United States could have managed events, and 2017, when America can do little more than witness them.",Commentary: Why the Kurdish referendum means the end of Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vanburen-kurds-commentary/commentary-why-the-kurdish-referendum-means-the-end-of-iraq-idUSKCN1C125Q

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Free markets sound like such a good idea. They offer choice and opportunities, which are good things. And who does not want freedom? Besides, if the alternative to these markets is the impassive, incompetent bureaucratic state, then the policy path is obvious. Let markets go free and peg back governments, so their only role in the productive economy is to deal with the occasional failure of markets to work as they should.

This story of private sector freedom and state sector sloth is often told. In the United States, profit-hungry entrepreneurs are considered economic heroes. Even in more social democratic Europe, few politicians or commentators publicly doubt that the profit motive is almost always the best way to get things done.

As with all good myths, there is a thin tie to reality. The Soviet Union showed that economies stagnate without private enterprise. However, communist Russia is long gone. The pairing of good free markets and bad governments should be evaluated by the standard of what is actually happening. By that measure, the story makes no sense, for four reasons.

First, markets and governments are not enemies. Markets are created and sustained by law and they thrive in well-governed societies. Complex modern economies cannot thrive without extensive regulation, and only governments can ensure that rules actually serve the common good.

Second, free markets sometimes subvert that common good. Take the pharmaceutical industry. It certainly produces many useful products, but the search for ever higher profits has led too many companies to focus on drugs which patients have to take for many years, rather than on antibiotics, which cure quickly and usually cheaply. In the United States, the industry’s blind dedication to profits has contributed to the wild over-prescription of opioid painkillers, helping to spawn a public health crisis.

Third, the private-public split is too simple. Many important institutions are neither one nor the other. In healthcare, education, scientific research and public infrastructure, much of the work may ultimately be under government control, but the leading organisations are mostly self-perpetuating and self-governing bodies. Mostly they serve the common good fairly well.

Finally, not-for-profit organisations have advantages over market players. Taxpayers and donors can fund projects which are too risky for private investors. Organisations with a public responsibility can work on socially useful projects which will never generate a big cash profit. These attributes give the government a much wider remit than just resolving market failures.

The free market myth will not go away on its own. It needs to be replaced. One potential substitute, the old narrative of the social market or social democracy, has lost its appeal. Perhaps voters should be grateful that the mixed economy has given them the highest level of prosperity and economic security ever seen. They are not thankful. On the contrary, they are increasingly tempted by populist narratives which condemn, among other things, stultifying government bureaucracy.

It is true that many government agencies have lost their way. All institutions tend to become rigid over time, but governments have an additional problem with morale. It’s hard to be imaginative and energetic when you’re frequently told that your only job is to pick up the messes left by the generally much more competent private sector.

The free-market answer to all problems is to shrink the government, but that would only make everything worse. The modern economy is a shared project which cannot work well without a vibrant non-private sector. If that sector is tired and beaten down, it needs to be encouraged and revived. University College London (UCL), itself a pretty vibrant non-private institution, has launched a project with exactly that goal. The Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose is run by economist Mariana Mazzucato. Her book “The Entrepreneurial State”, a defence of the contributions and potential of government in the modern economy, inspires the IIPP’s motto: entrepreneurial societies need entrepreneurial states.

Mazzucato has gathered an impressive selection of big names in the non-private economy on the IIPP’s advisory board, from James Galbraith, who teaches about the economic role of government at the University of Texas, to Mike Bracken, who led the successful effort to create user-friendly websites for the British government.

But the names on the board – and the chat at last week’s launch party in London – also show how much work remains to be done. Almost all the people listening enthusiastically to the narrative of the central role of the non-private sector were already well ensconced in that part of the economy.

To get past preaching to the converted, the new story has to persuade politicians. There are few signs of that happening. The private sector is even less interested. Shareholder value is still the norm and government is still generally treated as either an enemy or a tool to be manipulated in the fight for competitive advantage.

The move is a shift in strategy for the world’s largest social network, which previously has tried to keep users within its own service, and may help restore its image by strengthening ties to respected news organizations after the spread of false news stories on Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

It may also help soothe relations with some publishers, which often see their articles widely shared among Facebook’s more than 2 billion monthly users but have found it hard to translate Facebook readers into paying subscribers.

While publishers will own the data on users who buy a subscription, they will not have information on who reads the free articles on Facebook, a main point of contention for several publishers.

Under the trial, which includes the Boston Globe, Germany’s Bild and France’s Le Parisien, Facebook mobile users can read 10 articles under a publication’s paywall for free, or a selection of articles publishers allow access to, and will then be prompted to purchase a subscription on the publisher’s website for full access.

Facebook will not take a cut of the revenue from any subscriptions purchased, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.

Several major publishers have decided not to take part, largely because Facebook will not give access to reader data until they purchase a subscription.

An executive at Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp (NWSA.O), told Reuters Facebook’s one-size-fits-all testing model would be a step back from the Journal’s paywall strategy.

“Ten free articles is quite a lot,” said the executive, who requested anonymity. “It’s more about the data and around remaining in control of our membership strategy.”

Britain’s Financial Times will not participate either, a source familiar with the matter said. The newspaper, which also charges for access to its articles online, wanted a registration process to get hold of reader data in exchange for free articles, said the source.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to its lowest level in more than 44-1/2 years last week, pointing to a rebound in job growth after a hurricane-related decline in employment in September.

The labor market outlook was also bolstered by another report on Thursday showing a measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region racing to a record high in October. The signs of labor market strength could cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.

“It doesn’t take one hundred PhD economists at the Fed to figure out that the labor market is on the tight side of normal,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. “At this point, we would expect a sharp bounce-back in employment growth in October.”

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Oct. 14, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said. But the decrease in claims, which was the largest since April, was probably exaggerated by the Columbus Day holiday on Monday.

Claims are declining as the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma washes out of the data. The hurricanes, which lashed Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, boosted claims to an almost three-year high of 298,000 at the start of September.

A Labor Department official said claims for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico continued to be impacted by Irma and Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure. As a result the Labor Department was estimating claims for the islands.

Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 33,000 jobs in September as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey left more than 100,000 restaurant workers temporarily unemployed. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are not included in nonfarm payrolls.

Economists had forecast claims slipping to 240,000 in the latest week. The dollar briefly pared losses against a basket of currencies after the data. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors booked profits after a recent rally that lifted shares to record highs. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.

LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING

Last week marked the 137th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was smaller.

Improvements in the labor market have been largely due to a recovery that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term. While U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax plans, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies.

The labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a more than 16-1/2-year low of 4.2 percent. Tightening labor market conditions likely keep the Fed on track to raise interest in December for a third time this year, even as inflation remains moderate.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,500 to 248,250 last week.

The claims data covered the survey week for October nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 20,500 between the September and October survey periods, supporting views of a rebound in job growth this month.

“The data suggest that the underlying trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining,” said Jim O‘Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region soared 24 points to a record high reading of 30.6 in October.

The average workweek index also increased 8 points to a reading of 19.4. It said no firms reported decreases in employment this month. The robust labor market readings helped to lift the Philadelphia Fed’s current manufacturing activity index four points to a five-month high of 27.9 in October, offsetting declines in new orders and shipments measures.

Also underscoring labor market strength, the claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 16,000 to 1.89 million in the week ended Oct. 7, the lowest level since December 1973.

The four-week moving average of so-called continuing claims fell 22,750 to 1.91 million, the lowest level since January 1974.",U.S. jobless claims hit 44-1/2-year low; mid-Atlantic factories humming,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment/u-s-jobless-claims-hit-44-1-2-year-low-mid-atlantic-factories-humming-idUKKBN1CO1RU

Of 60 soldiers manning the base in the province of Kandahar, 43 were killed, nine were wounded and six were missing after the militants attacked in the middle of the night, the ministry said in a statement.

At least 10 Taliban were also reported killed in the battle, which occurred in Maiwand, a district that neighbours volatile Helmand province.

The attack will underscore worries about the ability of the Afghan security forces to deal with a relentless insurgency which they have struggled to contain since most foreign troops left at the end of 2014.

U.S. President Donald Trump committed to an open-ended military mission in Afghanistan in August despite criticism that it is no closer to peace despite billions of dollars in aid and nearly 16 years of U.S. and allied operations.

The attack began when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden American-made Humvee armoured vehicle, likely captured from Afghan security forces, into the gate of the base, an army official told Reuters.

That began an hours-long assault by Taliban gunmen, which was interrupted by a second Humvee breaking all the way into the base and detonating inside, he said.

The base itself was left in ruins, officials said.

Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, a spokesman for the militant group, said the attack began with a suicide car bomb followed by an assault that overran the base.

The militants had killed at least 60 Afghan soldiers and wounded many, he said.

The Taliban have been waging an insurgency for a decade and a half in an attempt to overthrow the Western-backed government in Kabul and re-establish a fundamentalist Islamic regime.

The United States and its allies maintain thousands of troops across Afghanistan, including in Kandahar, to advise and assist Afghan forces as well as conduct strikes against suspected militants.

When asked whether U.S. forces provided any support for the besieged Afghan base, a spokesman at the coalition military command in Kabul said: “We can confirm that U.S. forces conducted an air strike during an operation in the Maiwand district of Kandahar province, October 19, under counter-terror authorities.”

On Tuesday, at least 69 people were killed and scores wounded in Taliban attacks on government compounds in Paktia and Ghazni provinces.

Among the dead in those attacks were at least 36 members of the Afghan security forces, including a senior provincial police commander.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles Police Department said on Thursday that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

The LAPD robbery and homicide division interviewed a potential sexual assault victim, spokesman Kevin Maiberger told Reuters. No further information was given on who made the allegations or where the alleged incident occurred.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex,” his spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said in an emailed statement.

The move follows allegations reported earlier this month by The New York Times and The New Yorker from a number of women that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

The New York Police Department said last week it was investigating an allegation of sexual assault from 2004 against Weinstein.

The Los Angeles Times newspaper said Thursday that the allegation made to the LAPD came from an unnamed well-known Italian model and actress, who told police detectives that Weinstein raped her in a room at a Beverly Hills hotel after a film event in February 2013.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to provide “stronger support” to Italy for its work in Libya and replenish their Africa fund to further curb immigration to Europe.

“We have a real chance of closing the Central Mediterranean route,” chairman Donald Tusk said after 28 EU leaders meeting in Brussels discussed migration, stressing the need to lower the number of arrivals from Africa going through the Mediterranean to Italy.

EU executive European Commission told the group they needed to immediately chip in an extra 225 million euros for migration-related projects in Africa due to run this year and early next.

“If we do want to be as present as possible in Africa - mainly in the Northern part of Africa - we have to increase financial means,” Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said.

Brussels has so far committed 2.9 billion euros to the so-called Africa Trust Fund, with another 234 million euros from EU states, according to the Commission.

Brussels said 1.6 billion euros would be spent by the end of 2017 on Turkey. In 2016 the bloc promised 3 billion euros for Syrian refugees in exchange for Ankara shutting down the route traffickers and smugglers were using to get people to Greece.

Despite sour EU-Turkey relations on several issues, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Ankara for hosting refugees from Syria and said the bloc should pull together another 3 billion euros to that end.

“We have promised 3 billion euros for the coming years in addition to the 3 billion that we have already committed. We need to deliver on this promise,” Merkel told reporters on arriving for the two-day EU leaders’ summit in Brussels.

“This money helps the refugees who are living under very difficult conditions. Once again, Turkey is doing a great job here,” she said.

Since 2015, the bloc has helped Greece, Italy and Bulgaria with nearly 2 billion euros to manage immigration flows. It spent another 100 million euros on controlling migratory routes in the Western Balkans, according to figures provided by the bloc.

It has been spending on more deportations and financing United Nations projects for refugees and migrants in Africa, and mulling a center in Libya to assess asylum requests there.

IMMIGRATION DECLINES

Despite criticism from rights groups that the EU is violating international humanitarian law by striving to curb immigration, the bloc has applauded itself for reducing arrivals by more than 70 percent in 2016 from the peak in 2015 when more than a million people entered in an uncontrolled flow.

The influx of immigrants in 2015 caught the bloc by surprise, alarmed the EU’s 500 million people and fueled support for anti-immigration, populist and nationalist groups.

The bloc’s asylum system broke down under the sheer numbers and the cherished Schengen zone of control-free travel was strained as member states introduced emergency border checks.

EU states have since sought to agree on how to change their asylum laws, with bitter disputes deepening east-west divides.

Tusk said on Thursday the 28 EU leaders would discuss the issue again in December and were aiming for an agreement by mid-2018.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament agreed its own stance on asylum reform, including an option to cut EU funds to states that refuse to host asylum-seekers reaching the bloc.

It proposed moving away from the current rule mandating that the first country through which a person enters the EU must handle his or her asylum request, saying it puts too much burden on frontline states like Italy, Greece, Malta or Spain.

Southern frontline states want a scheme that would automatically lift people off their soil during periods of exceptionally high immigration and take them elsewhere in the EU.

Westerners like Germany and Sweden, which eventually receive most of the refugees, have said more of the burden must be shared and that solidarity was needed.

Eastern EU countries like Poland and Hungary have refused to admit anyone, saying doing so could compromise national security and affect the traditional composition of their populations.",EU leaders seek greater reductions in Africa immigration,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-eu/eu-leaders-seek-greater-reductions-in-africa-immigration-idUKKBN1CO2PY

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

Venezuela, the Latin American oil behemoth, has found itself struggling to repay debts to China and Russia that total at least $50 billion. But Sonangol chair Isabel dos Santos said her company was not on a similar track.

“There is really pretty much nothing in common,” dos Santos said. “Maybe just the weather.”

Dos Santos told a Reuters newsmaker event that Sonangol has already slashed $3 billion in debt, and that she has the backing of the new president for an ambitious reform plans that aims to further cut debts.

“Our relations are in full alignment,” dos Santos said, adding that João Lourenço, who took office last month, was “fully aware” of her plans for Sonangol’s transformation.

Dos Santos took the helm of the state oil company in June 2016, when her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos was still in office. He stepped down as president this year after 38 years in power. But she said the new administration was on board with the “huge task” of her five-year turnaround plan for Sonangol.

“We are engaged with the government and the government’s mission to overcome the difficulties in the Angolan economy.”

Sonangol was hit hard by the slump in oil prices that began in 2014. She said the company was “debt ridden” when she took the helm, but that there was no concern over outstanding loans from China, a key buyer of its oil and source of financing for Sonangol itself as well as Angola.

“There is no taboo (about) being financed by Chinese banks,” she said, adding that they had cut total company debts to $10 billion this year from $13 billion.

She declined to give a figure for the total amount Sonangol owed to Chinese lenders, citing only $3 billion from mainland Chinese banks.

But years of borrowing, particularly from China, left the nation with a dwindling amount of crude to sell for fresh revenue during the depths of the oil price crash, and others estimate its oil-backed debts to Chinese entities at at least $25 billion.

She added that Sonangol had paid all its outstanding bills to oil majors in the form of “cash calls” for 2016, after complaints of delays amid its cost-cutting drive, and said there would be no delays in those payments this year.","Angola is not the next Venezuela, state oil firm says as it cuts debt",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CO0Q4-OZATP

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly 340,000 Rohingya children are living in squalid conditions in Bangladesh camps where they lack enough food, clean water and health care, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday.

Up to 12,000 more children join them every week, fleeing violence or hunger in Myanmar, often still traumatised by atrocities they witnessed, it said in a report “Outcast and Desperate”.

In all, almost 600,000 Rohingya refugees have left northern Rakhine state since Aug. 25 when the U.N. says the Myanmar army began a campaign of “ethnic cleansing” following insurgent attacks.

“This isn’t going to be a short-term, it isn’t going to end anytime soon,” Simon Ingram, the report’s author and a UNICEF official, told a news briefing.

“So it is absolutely critical that the borders remain open and that protection for children is given and equally that children born in Bangladesh have their birth registered.”

Most Rohingya are stateless in Myanmar and many fled without papers, he said, adding of the newborns in Bangladesh: “Without an identity they have no chance of ever assimilating into any society effectively.”

Safe drinking water and toilets are in “desperately short supply” in the chaotic, teeming camps and settlements, Ingram said after spending two weeks in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

“In a sense it’s no surprise that they must truly see this place as a hell on earth,” he said.

One in five Rohingya children under the age of five is estimated to be acutely malnourished, requiring medical attention, he said.

“There is a very, very severe risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases, diarrhoea and quite conceivably cholera in the longer-term,” he added.

UNICEF is providing clean water and toilets, and has helped vaccinate children against measles and cholera, which can be deadly, he said.

The agency is seeking $76 million under a $434 million U.N. appeal for Rohingya refugees for six months, but is only 7 percent funded, he said, speaking ahead of a pledging conference in Geneva on Monday.

U.N. agencies are still demanding access to northern Rakhine, where an unknown number of Rohingya remain despite U.N. reports that many villages and food stocks have been burned.

“We repeat the call for the need for protection of all children in Rakhine state, this is an absolute fundamental requirement. The atrocities against children and civilians must end,” Ingram said.

Donald Trump mentioned Afghanistan just once in his speech to the United Nations Tuesday. His “new strategy for victory” there, he said, would help “crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.”

Trump outlined that new strategy on August 21, in an address that was a curious mixture of the vague and the specific. Speaking at Fort Myer, the U.S. president announced plans to deploy additional American troops, but did not give details about numbers, policy specifics or an exit strategy. He mentioned Pakistan 12 times – criticizing it for “housing the very terrorists that we are fighting” – but did not make a single mention of the two other countries ramping up resistance to the U.S. presence in the region: Russia and Iran.

That was a serious omission on Trump’s part. No U.S. plan for Afghanistan can accomplish even its most minimal objective of destroying militant groups like al Qaeda or the Taliban unless it factors in the mounting evidence that Tehran and Moscow are playing a more aggressive role in resisting the American presence in the region.

Sharif Yaftali, chief of general staff of the Afghan national army, told the BBC in an exclusive interview on September 6 that Kabul has evidence showing that Iran had provided the Taliban with weapons and equipment in western Afghanistan. While Yaftali acknowledged that Afghan security forces have not yet found any evidence of Russian support for the Taliban, others believe Tehran is consolidating its South Asian partnership with Russia by serving as a mediator between Moscow and Afghan insurgents.

“The regional politics have changed,” Mohammed Arif Shah Jehan, an Afghan senior intelligence official recently appointed the governor of Farah province adjacent to Iran told The New York Times in August. “The strongest Taliban here are Iranian Taliban.”

Iran also helps Russia provide various types of weaponry to the Taliban, Hayatullah Hayat, the provincial governor of Helmand province, told the Washington Post. The arms deliveries include rocket-propelled grenades, landmines, sniper rifles and 82mm mortar rounds.

In a similar vein, construction of the largely India-funded Chabahar port in Iran’s southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan province is arguably pursued with a view to the Afghan war and the strategic rivalries unfolding there. A counterweight to Pakistan’s Chinese-backed Gwadar port only 62 miles away, Chabahar will enhance Delhi's foothold in landlocked Afghanistan by offering it convenient access through the Gulf of Oman, thereby enabling India to bypass rival Pakistan. This can in turn boost Iran’s military mobility and political influence over events in the conflict-ridden nation.

Perhaps the most telling sign of Tehran-Taliban collaboration dates back to May 2016, when a U.S. drone targeted a lone vehicle on a desert route in the southwest Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killing the driver and his only passenger. The passenger’s passport listed his name as Wali Mohammad; U.S. and Afghan officials said he was really Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour.

Intriguingly, the mystery passenger was returning from Iran; the passport indicated that it was at least his second trip to the neighboring Islamic Republic that year.

The catalyst for Shiite Iran’s unlikely yet growing relationship with the Sunni Taliban has been the rise of the more militant, rabidly anti-Shiite Islamic State in parts of Afghanistan. For Iran, the Taliban is the lesser evil with the potential to serve as a local bulwark against the spread of the most aggressive anti-Iranian forces to its east.

Trump needs to recognize the profound regional shift in interests and alliances since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. Back in 2001, Tehran helped the U.S.-led coalition topple the Taliban, which it blamed for the killing of Iranian diplomats during the storming of Iran’s consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif three years earlier. The intelligence and military assistance offered by Iran and its Afghan allies in the Northern Alliance – a military front that also enjoyed the backing of Russia and India at the time – was indispensable to the U.S. mission.

Sixteen years on, Trump’s anti-Iran sentiments make a similar collaboration unlikely. However, Washington does have to recognize that it cannot ignore Iran’s national security concerns in its immediate neighborhood or Russia’s strategic interests in Central and South Asia. Trump doesn’t have to become Moscow or Tehran’s best friend, but he should be considering measures like offering to de-list Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism” and easing sanctions against Tehran and Moscow in return for their withdrawing support from anti-American forces in Afghanistan. Those measures aren’t going to end Afghanistan’s internal conflict, but they might de-escalate it enough for Trump to work on a new exit strategy for U.S. troops.",Commentary: The real deal Trump has to make on Afghanistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afghanistan-commentary/commentary-the-real-deal-trump-has-to-make-on-afghanistan-idUSKCN1BV28K

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The founder of Canada’s comedy festival ‘Just for Laughs’, which draws celebrities including Trevor Noah, Sarah Silverman and Jerry Seinfeld, has resigned from his own company in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment.

Gilbert Rozon made the announcement on his Facebook page on Wednesday night. He is the latest entertainment executive to be accused of sexual harassment in the wake of accusations against U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

“Shaken by the allegations against me, I wish to take time to reflect,” Rozon wrote, adding he was “sincerely sorry” for “all the women and men I may have offended in the course of my life.”

The company confirmed Rozon’s resignation and said an independent board of directors will be put in place. Spokesman Jean-David Pelletier declined to comment further.

Montreal newspaper ‘Le Devoir’ on Thursday reported allegations by nine women who said they had been sexually harassed or abused by Rozon.

Rozon announced his immediate resignation from ‘Just for Laughs’, as well as his departure from the committee organizing events to mark Montreal’s 375th anniversary this year and his role as vice president of the Montreal Board of Trade.

Held every summer in Montreal, ‘Just for Laughs’ is one of the largest international comedy festivals and is a major tourist attraction for the city.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has made gender equality a significant part of the government’s focus, said society was “seeing a moment of awakening”.

“It’s unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets and I think people are beginning to get it,” Trudeau told reporters in Montreal. “It doesn’t matter how much power you have, how much influence you have, it’s never all right.”

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc began offering electronics from third-party sellers to Brazilian shoppers on Wednesday, expanding beyond books in the fiercely competitive e-commerce market in Latin America’s largest economy.

The long-awaited move will offer televisions, cell phones and laptops from hundreds of independent sellers on Amazon’s website in Brazil without involving the company in the tricky logistics that have hurt many online retailers in the country.

Alex Szapiro, Amazon’s country manager in Brazil, declined to say if there were plans for the company to stock its own electronics inventory or open a fulfillment center to ship third-party goods more efficiently, as it did simultaneously with the launch of independent sellers in Mexico two years ago.

“Each country has a different playbook,” said Szapiro in an interview with Reuters at Amazon headquarters in Sao Paulo. He helped launch the company’s Brazil business with e-books in 2012 after running operations for Apple Inc in the country for five years.

Shares of local e-commerce rivals MercadoLibre Inc, Magazine Luiza SA and B2W Cia Digital have fallen 14 percent, 17 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the past week on concerns of heightened competition from Amazon.

Keeping pace with the local e-commerce market, Amazon will parcel purchases into as many as 10 monthly installments without interest, a practice the company started in Brazil for Kindle e-reader sales in 2014, then extended to Mexico and other markets.

Sellers will be paid up-front, minus a 10 percent commission to Amazon and fees of 19 reais ($6) per month or 2 reais per item. Szapiro called the 10 percent commission a “promotional” rate without saying when or how much it would eventually rise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whirlpool and GE Appliances asked a U.S. trade panel on Thursday to recommend 50 percent import duties on large residential washing machines to ensure that rivals LG and Samsung follow through on plans to shift washer production to the United States.

At a hearing in a “global safeguard” trade case that could lead to U.S. President Donald Trump imposing steep import restrictions, lawyers for the U.S. producers accused the South Korean companies of being “country hoppers” that have moved output several times to avoid prior anti-dumping duties.

“They have cheated domestic producers before. This is our last chance to get it right,” Whirlpool attorney Jack Levy told the U.S. International Trade Commission.

The commission on Oct. 5 unanimously found that surging imports of large residential washers from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and LG Electronics (066570.KS) were injuring domestic producers. It is scheduled to make remedy recommendations by Dec. 4 to Trump, who is expected to make final recommendation early next year.

Levy argued that a strong remedy would force the South Korean manufacturers to “country hop one more time, to America,” where they would compete more fairly and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base.

Whirlpool and GE Appliances, bought last year by China’s Haier Group (600690.SS)(1169.HK), are also seeking import quotas on key components such as washer cabinets, tubs and basket assemblies to prevent Samsung and LG from opening U.S. “kitting,” or “screwdriver” operations that simply assemble machines largely from imported parts.

Daniel Porter, an attorney representing LG, said a 50 percent duty would severely hurt LG and Samsung by shutting their imports out of the U.S. market until they start U.S. production in 2019. Losses to market share would be difficult to claw back, he added.

Samsung is converting a closed Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) generator factory in Newberry, South Carolina, planned to eventually employ nearly 1,000 workers, while LG is building an all-new factory in Clarksville, Tennessee, that would employ around 600.

Porter said these factories would likely employ fewer workers if import restrictions kept Samsung and LG washers out of the U.S. market for a year.

“Whirlpool’s 50 percent proposal is nothing short of raw, naked protectionism to allow Whirlpool to reach a cash windfall for a year or two,” Porter told the panel.

Both sides brought out members of Congress representing their plant locations to help argue their cases.

“Samsung brought hope, they brought jobs, they put food on the table for many residents,” said Representative Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican.","Whirlpool seeks 50 percent duties on LG, Samsung washers in U.S. trade case",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-whirlpool/whirlpool-seeks-50-percent-duties-on-lg-samsung-washers-in-u-s-trade-case-idUSKBN1CO31Z?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump risks driving Iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with North Korea if Washington ends a nuclear deal with Iran, former Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday.

Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

“If you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,” Kerry said.

He was speaking in a private lecture delivered at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.

“And secondly, screw around with the deal that has already been made because the message is don’t make a deal with the United States, they won’t keep their word,” he said.

The nuclear deal places Iran under tough restraints, including round-the-clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced, Kerry said. “We would notice an uptick in their enrichment, like that,” he said, snapping his fingers.

“And nobody that I know of with common sense can understand what the virtue is in accelerating a confrontation with the possibility that they might decide they want to break out and make it (a nuclear bomb) now instead of 10 or 15 or 25 years from now,” he said.

If Iran violated the accord, U.N. sanctions would snap back into place, Kerry said. “Moreover, at that point in time folks, we have a year of break-up. We have all the time that we need in the world to be able to bomb their facilities into submission.”

Ending the deal could lead to Iran hiding fissile production facilities “deep in a mountain where we have no insight”.

“So the scenario that Trump opens up by saying ‘let’s get rid of the deal’ is actually proliferation, far more damaging and dangerous,” Kerry said.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Tehran would stick to its accord as long as the other signatories respected it, but would “shred” the deal if Washington pulled out, state TV reported.

Kerry, speaking on Swiss television RTS on Thursday night, was asked about Trump’s habit of tweeting policies and insults.

“More and more Americans are finding the Twitter phenomenon tiring, destructive and interruptive of a genuine kind of dialogue. I think it creates chaos politics which is not good.”

On Trump’s public undermining of his successor as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Kerry said it was “unprecedented and very, very unproductive, even counter-productive”.",Ending Iran nuclear deal would worsen North Korea situation: Kerry,https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-kerry/ending-iran-nuclear-deal-would-worsen-north-korea-situation-kerry-idINKBN1CO339

Investors have been anxious to hear who President Donald Trump will pick as the nominee. A decision like Powell would likely be a continuation of the current stock market-friendly monetary policy that has helped fuel the market’s more than eight-year bull run.

Stocks had been recovering from early losses for much of the afternoon but the S&P 500 and Dow were still a tad lower just before the Powell report.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I can’t observe any other reason for why we ended up.”

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of (current Fed Chair) Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove ... and, with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber-accommodative monetary policy, as more welcome than the alternative,” he said.

Powell was among several names circulating as possible picks, including Yellen. Others include Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

The White House on Wednesday said Trump will announce his decision on the matter in the “coming days.”

Tech shares were among the day’s biggest drags, led by Apple (AAPL.O), which fell 2.4 percent in its biggest daily percentage decline since Aug. 10 as doubts about its double 2017 iPhone release strategy weighed on investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 5.44 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 23,163.04, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.84 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,605.07.

Stocks have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

The day also marked the 30th anniversary of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Most traders see a repeat of the crash as unlikely because of modern trading technology and other changes.

Investors also took profits in the broader tech sector, which has had a strong run so far this year, gaining about 30 percent and helping drive the market’s recent record run. The tech index .SPLRCT was down 0.4 percent on the day.

Weighing on the market early as well was some disappointing news on the earnings front.

United Airlines (UAL.N) tumbled 12.1 percent, weighing on other airlines stocks after the third-largest U.S. carrier’s profit fell due to flight cancellations during the hurricane season. American Airlines (AAL.O) fell 1 percent.

Shares of eBay (EBAY.O) were down 1.8 percent a day after it reported results.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.33-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Everton’s miserable Europa League run continued as they lost 2-1 at home to Olympique Lyonnais on Thursday and remained bottom of their group as Arsenal beat 10-man Red Star Belgrade 1-0 thanks to an acrobatic late goal by Olivier Giroud.

Everton badly needed a win against Lyon after taking one point from their previous two games but they went behind in the sixth minute to a penalty by Nabil Fekir.

Ashley Williams headed them level in the 69th after being fortunate to only be yellow-carded for igniting a mass brawl when he shoved visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes.

Everton nearly went ahead when a Gilfi Sigurdsson free kick came off the far post but former Chelsea forward Bertrand Traore struck to restore Lyon’s lead, leaving Ronald Koeman’s side at the foot of Group E with one point from three games.

The Dutch coach is under pressure as his side have only won three games out of 12 in all competitions and are 16th in the Premier League standings.

“We always feel pressure, from ourselves and pressure from outside,” Everton defender Williams told reporters.

“It’s disappointing we didn’t get a result tonight because I felt we had a good attitude, and I thought we had a lot of chances.”

Serie A side Atalanta lead the group on seven points after beating Apollon Limassol.

Arsenal were given a fright in Belgrade when Richmond Boaqye hit the woodwork but they took advantage of Milan Rodic getting sent off in the 81st minute as Giroud leapt to scoop a cushioned header from Theo Walcott into the top corner, completing a sweeping move through the middle.

“It was a very difficult game amid high and heated intensity,” said Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger.

“The (home crowd) support was absolutely amazing, it was fantastic. Red Star are a massive club with a big history and the people here know their football.”

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

E’ il risultato dell‘ultimo sondaggio trimestrale Reuters, compilato tra il 10 e il 16 ottobre, da confrontare con la stessa indagine di luglio ma anche con l‘aggiornamento delle stime ufficiali e dei principali osservatori.

La mediana delle attese sulla crescita -- 48 su quest‘anno, 47 sul prossimo -- vede un‘espansione di 1,4% nel 2017 e 1,2% nel 2018, in entrambi i casi due decimi oltre il consensus di luglio, compilato tra la prima e la seconda decade.

Da tre mesi a questa parte, del resto, il governo ha rivisto le attese ufficiali nella Nota di aggiornamento al Def, portando la proiezione a 1,5% sia su quest‘anno sia sul prossimo.

Hanno nel frattempo dipinto un quadro più roseo per la crescita italiana -- e non soltanto -- il Fondo monetario internazionale e Ref la settimana scorsa, come hanno fatto anche Banca d‘Italia e Confindustria a metà settembre.

Il consensus raccolto da Reuters sulla dinamica del Pil si ferma dunque un decimo al di sotto delle proiezioni ufficiali quest‘anno e tre decimi il prossimo.

DEBITO IN CALO DA 2018, STABILI PREZZI CONSUMO E DISOCCUPATI

Come prevedono anche il Fondo e l‘ampia maggioranza degli osservatori, a differenza di quanto indica il governo, il decumulo della montagna del debito partirà soltanto l‘anno prossimo.

Rispetto al 132% con cui si è chiuso il 2016, il rapporto debito/Pil dovrebbe salire a 132,4% quest‘anno (132,8% il consensus di luglio) per poi decelerare leggermente a 131,7% (132%) il prossimo. Nella Nota di aggiornamento al Def la proiezione è invece di 131,6% sul 2017 e 130% sul 2018.

Per il disavanzo le attese Reuters convergono su 2,2% sia per quest‘anno sia per il prossimo, rispetto a 2,3% e 2,1% indicati in luglio e contro il quadro programmatico che indica 2,1% sul 2017 e 1% sul 2018.

Capisaldi della manovra, che Paolo Gentiloni ha definito “snella” e passa ora al vaglio del parlamento, sono il congelamento di Iva e accise, la decontribuzione per i nuovi assunti a tempo indeterminato e le risorse per il rinnovo del contratto nel pubblico impiego, scaduto da quasi dieci anni.

Secondo Pier Carlo Padoan, il 40% delle coperture arriva da tagli alla spesa e il resto da un aumento delle entrate, mentre resta aperto il capitolo privatizzazioni e dismissioni (0,2% e 0,3% del Pil gli obiettivi del governo rispettivamente sul 2017 e sul 2028), a garanzia di una progressiva discesa del debito anche nei prossimi anni.

Tornando infine brevemente alle attese dell‘ultima indagine Reuters, perfettamente invariate rispetto a luglio le stime su costo della vita e tasso di disoccupazione.

Come tre mesi fa, per l‘inflazione l‘idea è di una media di 1,4% quest‘anno e 1,2% il prossimo, per la percentuale dei disoccupati 11,3% nel 2017 e 11% nel 2018.

Twenty rebels among the remaining Islamic State loyalists holed up in the devastated heart of Marawi City were killed in the latest fighting, likely including Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, said Colonel Romeo Brawner, deputy commander of a military task force.

“There is a big possibility that Dr Mahmud is among them,” Brawner told reporters.

“But we will only be definite once we have a match of probably DNA samples, maybe of the dental records.”

If confirmed, Mahmud’s death would be a blow to any effort by Islamic State, which is on the back foot in Syria and Iraq, to establish a presence in Mindanao, an island with a history of rebellion and home to the predominantly Roman Catholic nation’s Muslim minority.

The Marawi siege has been the Philippines’ biggest security crisis in years, but some experts see it as a prelude to a more ambitious bid by militants to exploit Mindanao’s poverty and use its jungles and mountains as a base to train, recruit and launch attacks in the region.

The armed forces in a statement said 13 militants were killed overnight and seven on Monday morning.

Two hostages were rescued and information they provided meant the authorities were “increasingly becoming confident” that Mahmud was dead.

The 39-year-old former university lecturer is believed to have been pivotal in raising and channelling funds for the alliance and its foreign fighters during an occupation that has lasted 150 days, killing more than 1,000 people, mostly rebels. Central Marawi has been flattened by government air strikes.

Some experts say Mahmud could become Islamic State’s Southeast Asian “emir” after the death on Monday of Isnilon Hapilon, the head of the alliance that seeks to carve out an Islamic State “Wilaya” in the southern Philippines.

Philippine soldiers on Monday killed Hapilon, a target of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. They also killed Omarkhayam Maute, one of two brothers at the helm of the Maute militant clan.

Mahmud was seen in a video alongside Hapilon and the Maute brothers plotting the Marawi siege. Security experts say he studied in Pakistan and learned to make bombs in an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan. He left Malaysia in 2014.

Brawner said the military was relentless in finishing off the rebels, but was unsure how many were left. Estimates on Monday were 20 to 40 fighters.

“The resistance is still there. In fact, we can hear from the background, the battle is ongoing,” he said.

Security analyst Rommel Banlaoi said the end of Mahmud would not mean the end of the extremists’ presence in Mindanao.

“There are still high-value terrorist personalities who are still at large in Mindanao, not to mention other foreign fighters coming from Indonesia and elsewhere in the Arab world,” he said on television.

“They are very, very elusive and because they mixed with the communities and at the same time, they hang out with the armed groups that have the mastery of the terrain in Mindanao. It’s very difficult for them to be caught by the military.”",Philippines says 'big possibility' Malaysian militant leader killed,https://in.reuters.com/article/philippines-militants/philippines-says-big-possibility-malaysian-militant-leader-killed-idINKBN1CO0CT

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slipped against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, retreating from a near one-week high earlier in the day, as oil prices fell and the rally in global stocks paused.

The weakness came ahead of Friday’s domestic inflation data for September and retail sales figures for August as well as the Bank of Canada’s October rate decision next week.

Chances of an October hike have fallen to 15 percent from nearly 50 percent in mid-September, the overnight index swaps market indicated. BOCWATCH

“I’d rather be a U.S. dollar seller because I think the (Federal Reserve) is pretty much fully priced at this point for December,” said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.

“We still think the Bank of Canada goes in December again, and we’re not anywhere fully priced for that, so there’s probably more interest rate risk in the CAD’s favor from that point of view.”

An uncertain outlook for the North American Free Trade Agreement is a headwind for the loonie and growth in the economy is expected to slow after rapid expansion in the first half of the year.

At 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading at C$1.2479 to the greenback, or 80.13 U.S. cents, down 0.1 percent.

The currency, which has been range-bound recently after rallying nearly 4 percent since early September, touched its strongest intraday level since Friday at C$1.2451.

“I think we’ll probably continue to pivot around C$1.25,” said Osborne, adding that Scotiabank remained constructive on the Canadian dollar in part because of its view on the Bank of Canada, but also because of its negative view on the U.S. dollar.

Prices of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, fell on profit-taking and larger-than-expected product inventories in the United States. Benchmark crude prices have found support in recent weeks because of OPEC-led supply cuts, Middle East tensions and lower U.S. production.

U.S. crude CLc1 prices settled down 1.4 percent at $51.29 a barrel.

World stocks retreated from all-time highs as traders marked 30 years to the day since the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain launched a fund on Friday to support new technology to screen hand-luggage in airports in a bid to detect concealed explosives without passengers having to remove electrical items from their bags.

The Department for Transport said 3 million pounds ($3.9 million) would be made available to support innovation in the detection of hidden explosives, as well as new methods to recognize when electrical items had been tampered with.

“We need to embrace and encourage the talent from industry that will allow us to stay several steps ahead of those who wish us harm,” security minister Ben Wallace said in a statement.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior White House aide said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets.

Marc Short, the White House’s top liaison to Congress, said on CNN that Obamacare’s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal.

“We’re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we’re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,” Short said.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving the subsidies, which Trump has discontinued, for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage.

The bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on Thursday after several Republican senators said they would support the measure. But Short’s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement. Democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of Obamacare.

Short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the bill’s co-authors and would likely make them public.

“The gist is we believe that the individual mandate should (be) repealed, employer mandate repealed and allow Americans to contribute to health savings accounts,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Alexander and Murray said the deal they struck now has the support of 12 of the 52 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate, as well as 12 Democrats.

While Alexander predicted in remarks on the Senate floor that the plan “will become law in some fashion before the end of the year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is against it.

Lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the Senate floor tucked inside a bigger “must-pass” bill that Congress needs to act on in December, such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown.

Trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. But his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra-party divisions.

Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance to 20 million people but Republicans call it government interference in Americans’ healthcare.

The law’s individual mandate requires all Americans to purchase health insurance, while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage.

TRUMP REVERSES POSITION

Trump initially indicated support for the Alexander-Murray agreement but reversed himself, saying on Wednesday “I can never support bailing out” insurers.

Senator Mike Rounds, one of the bill’s Republican co-sponsors, said that if Trump decides he does not support it, “then it will not go forward.” When a reporter noted that Trump does oppose it, Rounds replied, “That was yesterday.”

Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, who focuses on healthcare, said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing, with Trump “flip-flopping every day” and Ryan not supportive of the bill.

Among hospital stocks, Community Health Systems (CYH.N) closed up 3.7 percent, Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) rose 2.9 percent and HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA.N) gained 3 percent. Most insurers rose more modestly.

Without the subsidies, insurance premiums for some of the 10 million Americans who get coverage through Obamacare markets will surge. Noting that some conservative Republicans object to the subsidies, Alexander asked, “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy insurance, or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created?”

The bill has broad support among Democrats, but had just seven Republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier.

Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, who co-authored a bill in September to repeal and replace Obamacare that failed to muster enough support, endorsed the bipartisan effort.

“We believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long-term solution” that would overhaul Obamacare, they said in a joint statement.

If passed in December, as opposed to before the Nov. 1 beginning of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare insurance policies, it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year, meaning its benefits might not be felt until 2019. Insurers have already decided whether to participate in the Obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

The bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

Many Senate Republicans are nervous about the prospect of voting on any healthcare measure - no matter what legislation it may be attached to - that buttresses Obamacare.

Part of the fear, one senior Senate Republican aide said, is that Trump’s former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is recruiting hard-line conservative primary challengers to run against incumbent Republican senators next year. The aide said incumbents do not want to be forced to cast a controversial vote to stabilize Obamacare, a law reviled by many conservatives.

If all 46 Senate Democrats and two independents back the Alexander-Murray bill as expected, the support of the 12 Republicans means the bill has the 60 votes needed to reach the super-majority required to pass most legislation in the Senate.

Trump on Thursday underscored his concerns about the bill. He urged Alexander and Murray to be “careful with respect to the insurance companies,” which he said are “extremely talented at making money.”

Alexander and Murray said their legislation does not bail out insurers. Alexander said House Republicans passed an Obamacare repeal and replace bill in May that also would continue subsidy payments for two years.

Alexander said Trump has called him four times in recent days on this subject, including a Saturday night call when he was at a restaurant and “my dinner got cold.” He urged the president to support the initiative.",White House says rollback of Obamacare must be part of short-term fix,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-healthcare/white-house-says-rollback-of-obamacare-must-be-part-of-short-term-fix-idUKKBN1CO307?il=0

But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East.

Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.

“We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,” said the bloc’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini.

The EU leaders’ joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday, “reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal”.

The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall.

Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a programme the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.

The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said.

Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would “shred” it.

The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea.

In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile programme and its regional political role.

“We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don’t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,” an EU official said.

“If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic programme and Iran’s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.”

Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile programme would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The EU, which has expressed “concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions” in the Middle East, has said these issues should be discussed without direct links to the nuclear deal.

“They were never very fond of the nuclear deal in the first place but now the situation has changed a lot. Both many Democrats as well as some Republicans feel like they need to play a more active role on foreign policy to restrain the president,” the official said.",EU leaders talk up Iran nuclear deal hoping to save it from Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-nuclear-eu/eu-leaders-talk-up-iran-nuclear-deal-hoping-to-save-it-from-trump-idUKKBN1CO1L7

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Since two massive earthquakes hit Mexico in September, claiming more than 460 lives, an early warning start-up called SkyAlert has doubled its users to 5.8 million, making it one of the country’s most downloaded apps.

SkyAlert has also found a market selling alarms to small businesses in the capital, said its co-founder and director Alvaro Velasco. And it is looking to expand to Latin America, mainly Colombia, Peru and Chile, which lack an official alerting system despite frequent quakes in those countries.

Velasco said that he and SkyAlert co-founder Alejandro Cantú are talking to investors from Mexico and elsewhere about raising 100 million pesos ($5.35 million) in capitalization in 2018.

He said the surge in users after the most recent deadly quake in Mexico City had heightened the interest of existing investors including U.S.-based American Messaging and attracted interest from two Mexico-based private equity funds.

American Messaging did not respond to requests to comment on any potential new investment.

Velasco said SkyAlert was in talks with those funds and existing investors to inject around 20 million pesos (1.05 million dollars) into SkyAlert.

Still, finding a sustainable business model for the quake monitoring app has been a challenge partly because recent regulation in Mexico City has limited SkyAlert’s ability to access funds through public financing.

MAKING A PROFIT NOT EASY

Shomit Ghose at Onset Ventures, a U.S. private equity company with experience in software start-ups, said quake apps have struggled to get adequate financing because of the lack of a clear path to profits.

“If the business model is B2B where the earthquake early-warning is sent to companies, or railways, or hospitals, or high-buildings then perhaps a strong B2B case can be made for start-up investment,” Ghose said.

SkyAlert’s predicament echoes that of companies seeking funding to develop earthquake alert apps in the United States. Seismic activity is hard to monetize without government support.

It competes with its former partner, Mexico’s official alerting system run by government-funded non profit CIRES, which was created after an earthquake in 1985 killed thousands in the country.

One of the world’s few widely deployed seismic alarms, CIRES runs a network of sirens positioned around Mexico City that warn of a coming quake. SkyAlert mainly warns people through a mobile app.

Both sell quake warning systems, but a 2016 regulatory reform requires public buildings in Mexico City to purchase alarm systems from CIRES, limiting SkyAlert’s public financing.

SkyAlert initially replicated CIRES’ alerts, but in 2015 it decided to deploy its own detection sensors to increase coverage with greater accuracy, Velasco said.

“After a few false alerts from CIRES that affected SkyAlert’s credibility, we decided to invest in our own technology,” he said.

SkyAlert also is exploring ways to monetize its free app.

Currently, it sells a “premium” version for $4 a year that allows users to personalize alerts. However, Mexico has an average per capita income of $8,200, and the company said only around 4 percent of users pay for it.

Velasco said SkyAlert’s revenue is split fairly evenly between those fees and income from selling to businesses.

The newest version of the app allows for paid advertising, but ads would not be visible during a seismic alert.

SkyAlert, founded in 2011, has few peers, but one similar service in Japan is called YureKuru Call, which relies on government seismic data. YureKuru has received some government funding on an ad-hoc basis, but like SkyAlert is mostly funded by fees, said Rina Suzuki, an official at RC Solution Co., the Tokyo-based firm that developed YureKuru.

Detection technologies are evolving and they are all perfectible, Jennifer Strauss, external relations officer at the Berkeley Seismology Lab told Reuters.

“In the end, what matters is how effective they are at alerting people to save lives,” said Strauss.","After massive quakes, millions in Mexico turn to early warning app",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CO35E-OCATC

“I don’t think anyone was prepared for what actually transpired in the overseas markets, which led to the bloodbath on Monday,” said Kenny.

The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index .SPX plunged 20.5 percent on Black Monday, equal to a drop of over 520 points today, and the Nasdaq dropped 11.4 percent, comparable to a drop of about 750 points.

Related Coverage Could the 1987 stock market crash happen again?

In 1987 U.S. stock prices had climbed steadily all year, as they have in 2017, with each of the three major U.S. indexes hitting record highs in late August. But September turned into a difficult month, with each index falling more than 2.0 percent, though not by enough to raise alarm bells among investors.

But as the calendar flipped to October, the selling in U.S. equity markets intensified. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX fell more than 9.0 percent in the week before Black Monday.

On the morning of Monday, October 19, 1987, Art Hogan, then a floor broker at the Boston Stock Exchange, expected a possible rebound for stock prices. Nothing had prepared him for what was to unfold.

“It was clear in that first hour... this was going to be as bad as we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” said Hogan, now chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

Many describe the events of Black Monday as the first instance of computer trading gone haywire, caused by the use of portfolio insurance, a hedging strategy against market declines that involves selling short in stock index futures.

The prior week’s fall in U.S. stocks led to selling by investors in Asian markets to limit losses. Those losses then signaled investors in Europe to sell, which caused increased selling by the time U.S. markets were to open on Black Monday.

“It was like nobody wanted to question the computer,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York, who was a 26-year-old in his second year as a member of the NYSE.

“Then what happens is it feeds on itself because as the prices got worse the risk management software kept spitting out a new message - You need to sell more,” said Polcari.

Portfolio insurance, the short selling of stock index futures to protect against a decline in value, caused computerized program trading to issue sell orders as a safeguard against more losses. Instead, losses intensified, causing even more sell orders in a feedback loop.

With computer trading in its infancy, the floor of the NYSE was filled with more members than today, with trades executed by hand on paper. Thousands of traders scrambled to handle the tidal wave of selling, with volumes so extreme prices were delayed by hours, further complicating the process.

“The opening was 90 minutes (delayed), so you knew there was a lot of influx of orders, the futures (contracts) were down, everything was down, so we knew we were in for a rough ride,” said Peter Costa, president at Empire Executions Inc in New York, who has been working on the trading floor since 1981.

The widespread selling and delay in reporting prices also hit the stock options market, said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York who was trading options on the American Exchange at the time of the crash.

“The options market slowed down to a crawl because nobody could really figure out how to derive options prices from equities because we weren’t sure what the equity prices were,” said Charlop.

Of the 30 companies whose stocks are in the Dow today, slightly less than half were in the index at the time. American Express (AXP.N) lost 26.2 percent on Black Monday, Procter & Gamble (PG.N) plunged 27.8 percent, and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) tumbled 23.4 percent.

“The price movements in the stocks were not like anything I had ever seen prior to that day, or since that day, in fact,” said Ted Weisberg, floor trader with Seaport Securities in New York, who has been a member of the exchange since 1969.

“It was in fact the scariest day, the most emotional day, except when we came back to work after September 11, that I have ever spent on the trading floor.”","Thirty years ago this week, Wall Street slid into the abyss",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-crash-anniversary/feature-thirty-years-ago-this-week-wall-street-slid-into-the-abyss-idINKBN1CO14F

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

As Reuters recently reported, the White House is preparing to shift oversight of the sale of American-manufactured small arms from the diligent State Department review process to the business-friendly Commerce Department. By loosening the inter-agency guidelines in an attempt to boost America’s share in the global marketplace, the Trump administration runs the risk of fueling the civil wars currently bringing misery to millions worldwide.

The aim of this policy is to enable U.S. weapons manufactures to sell their products overseas quickly by trimming the bureaucratic red tape now governing the export of non-military grade weapons and ammunition. According to the Reuters report, the new plan would mean that commercial gun exports would no longer be given the same scrutiny as missile and fighter jet sales, which often require congressional approval. The shift would also move weapons like assault rifles and handguns from the State Department’s tightly-restricted Munitions list to the Commerce Control Lists, which allows for more streamlined licensing for international sales. While the administration has explained these new procedures as a logical extension of a U.S. president who is solidly pro-business, the transfer of authority from Foggy Bottom will have unintended and damaging foreign policy repercussions.

In contrast to the significant decline in major conventional conflicts over the last 50 years, unconventional conflicts within a sovereign state’s territory, such as the current war in Syria, have become the new normal. Small weapons like AK-47’s assault rifles, Kalashnikovs, sniper rifles, and low-grade explosives are used in most of these confrontations. Indeed, the ease with which a combatant with little military training can use semi-automatic weapons on the battlefield is part of the weapons’ appeal.

Light arms have many advantages for guerilla armies: an AK-47 is a lot cheaper than a tank, a missile defense system, or a fighter aircraft and it can be smuggled across porous borders. As Senators Ben Cardin, Patrick Leahy, and Dianne Feinstein wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in opposing the new rules, the civil wars and rebellions currently taking place are being fueled by the illegal sales of what many Americans would categorize as sports rifles or hunting equipment.

Relaxing the rules on small arms exports is counterproductive to the U.S. objective of de-escalating these conflicts. The new administration policy has the potential to squander the inclusive diplomatic processes Washington has encouraged in order to promote peaceful approaches to conflict resolution in states as varied as South Sudan, Ukraine, and Colombia. Multiple agencies and departments within the U.S. government would in effect be working against one another, with the State Department hoping to end the very hostilities that are sustained by American-manufactured weapons.

Washington would not be deliberately arming combatants in a civil war, but the handguns and assault rifles American firearms manufacturers sell on the open market could find their way to a conflict zone through smuggling and diversion. In one highly-publicized case last year, corrupt Jordanian intelligence officers sold a cache of rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles that were destined for the moderate Syrian opposition to arms merchants on the underground market. The FBI later determined that one of those weapons was likely to have been responsible for the shooting deaths of two American contractors in Jordan that same year.

The civil war in Libya illustrates the insecurity that can result when governments send weapons into a conflict zone without crafting the necessary oversight and security measures that help prevent them from being sold off elsewhere. During the 2011 armed rebellion against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Washington's Arab partners – with the secret blessing of the Obama administration – delivered military assistance to the rebels trying to oust the regime. While the military aid helped to drive Gaddafi from power after eight months of combat, that same equipment eventually helped fuel the civil war still ravaging Libya. Libyan militias previously concerned with overthrowing Qaddafi began stockpiling arms to increase their political leverage for later internal battles. The availability of weapons in Libya remains so overwhelming that U.N. experts have categorized the North African country as a regional weapons bazaar. Weapons that were sent into the country to aid the Libyan rebellion have been diverted to other regional conflicts, either through arms smuggling across lightly defended borders or through illicit arms deals. African officials claim that some of these arms likely assisted the jihadist Boko Haram group to recover after serious territorial losses against the Nigerian army.

According to the Small Arms Survey, the United States is already the world’s top exporter of small arms, having reached a total of $1.1 billion in 2014. While this figure is small compared to the far larger conventional weapons contracts U.S. defense manufacturers sign every year, the possibility that even a fraction of these commercial weapons could leak into a conflict zone would have a deeply negative impact.

The question is whether the monetary benefits that are likely to result from the administration’s new rules are enough to compensate for the instability and violence that are likely to increase with more small arms available for sale around the world. The ease with which U.S. arms companies will now be able to export their products may be terrific from a business perspective. But from the standpoint of international peace and security, this policy is a dangerous gamble for the White House to take.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process said on Thursday.

Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting “went well,” the source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list.

“I don’t think he’s leaning yet,” the source said.

Powell, who is viewed as representing a continuation of Yellen’s gradualist approach to raising interest rates, along with Warsh, are seen as the top contenders.

Despite his time as Fed Governor under Chair Ben Bernanke, Warsh is seen as a less well-known nominee. He has criticized the Fed’s bond-buying program and advocated changes in its inflation target.

U.S. Treasury yields briefly renewed their drop late Thursday after Politico reported that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell for the job.

Trump leaves on Nov. 3 for a tour of Asia and is expected to announce his choice before that trip.

The president told reporters on Tuesday that he likes all five candidates. “I’ll make a decision over the next fairly short period of time,” Trump said.

Meanwhile, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Freedom Caucus mounted a campaign to kill any chance of a second term for Yellen, the latest sign conservative Republicans want a fresh face at the helm of the Fed, which sets U.S. monetary policy.

Representative Warren Davidson, a Republican on the House Financial Services Committee’s monetary policy panel, is among those who want a change. He is circulating a letter opposing Yellen’s reappointment, the Ohio congressman’s spokesman said.

“Davidson is very passionate about this process,” the spokesman said, adding that the lawmaker is particularly concerned about the impact Fed policy has had on the ability of small firms to raise operating funds.

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative Republican grouping in Congress, have been critical of Yellen, with some accusing her of keeping monetary policy too loose.

Key members of the House Financial Services Committee also have backed ideas proposed by contenders to replace Yellen. Taylor’s research, for example, figured prominently in a House-passed bill requiring the Fed to explain its actions through a strict set of rules.

The House, however, has no direct control over the appointment of a Fed chief. The Senate decides whether to confirm the president’s nominee.

Trump has criticized Yellen in the past and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington by naming new people to top jobs and embracing different ideas. But his economic agenda could benefit from the steady economic conditions fostered by Yellen’s Fed.

Cohn’s chances of getting the job were thought to have dimmed after he publicly criticized the president’s response to a white supremacist rally in Virginia.

But the top White House economic adviser, who is helping to lead the administration’s push for tax reform, has since gotten back into Trump’s good graces.","Trump concludes Fed chair interviews, could decide next week: source",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-fed/trump-concludes-fed-chair-interviews-could-decide-next-week-source-idUKKBN1CO383?il=0

In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time.

Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 a.m. deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence.

The war of words increased uncertainty over a standoff that has raised fears of social unrest, cut growth prospects for the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy and rattled the euro.

“If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence,” Puigdemont said.

Catalonia, which has a distinctive culture and language, triggered Spain’s biggest political crisis for decades with a secession bid it put to a referendum on Oct 1. Only 43 percent of voters participated but those who did voted overwhelmingly to secede, while opponents of secession mostly stayed home.

Spanish courts have ruled the referendum illegal, but Puigdemont says the result is binding and must be obeyed.

The European Union declined to help mediate, saying the crisis was for Madrid and Barcelona to resolve.

“Member states are clear there is no room or space for any kind of mediation,” European Council President Donald Tusk told a news conference during an EU leaders summit in Brussels.

The regional authorities have not made clear how and when a declaration of independence would take place and whether it would be endorsed by the regional assembly. Some pro-independence lawmakers have said they want to hold a vote in the Catalan parliament to lend it a more solemn character.

Rajoy plans to invoke Article 155 of the 1978 constitution, which allows taking control of a region if it breaks the law.

A senior government source said the exact measures would be agreed on Saturday and probably voted through the upper house Senate on Oct. 30, giving the secessionists a few days of leeway to respond before Madrid takes control.

The regional authorities could use that time to split unilaterally, call elections in the hope of strengthening their mandate, or back down, although this is seen as highly unlikely.

“From the moment the measures are known, the regional government knows what’s going to happen and has a period of time to act until 155 can be acted upon,” the source said.

Spanish stocks, bonds and the euro all suffered in early trade, but recovered, a bounce some strategists attributed to a sense that Madrid had the upper hand in the standoff.

LAW UNCLEAR

The terms of Article 155 are vague and could spur more wrangling with the restive region.

“The government will use all the tools available to restore as soon as possible the law and the constitutional order, recover peaceful cohabitation between citizens and stop the economic damage that the legal uncertainty is creating,” government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said in a statement.

Rajoy’s team met members of the socialist party to coordinate their next steps. A spokesman for the Socialists said while they fully stood behind the government they would insist Article 155 is applied in the most proportionate way.

Madrid’s options range from closing down the regional parliament and expelling lawmakers, to a softer and more targeted approach, the government source said. Theoretically, the central administration could take control of the region’s finances and police, and call a snap election.

But some members of the Catalan government have already questioned this interpretation of the constitution, suggesting the stand-off could extend for at least several more days.

Carles Riera, a lawmaker from the pro-independence CUP party whose 10 deputies are vital to Puigdemont’s coalition, said dialogue with the Spanish state now looked impossible, and called on the leader to formalize a declaration of independence.

“From our point of view, the sooner this happens the better,” Riera told Reuters in the Catalan capital Barcelona.

Impatience is also setting in among residents of the port city. Merche, 55, who voted for secession in the referendum, said she was tired of the political to-and-fro.

“People want a resolution. Go for one thing or the other, but leave people in peace to carry on with their routine and their work,” she said, rearranging lettuces on her market stall.

Puigdemont has already defied Rajoy once this week, when he ignored a first deadline to drop the independence campaign and instead called for talks.

Rajoy says the Catalan government has repeatedly broken the law, including when it held the banned referendum and when it made a symbolic declaration of independence on Oct. 10, only to suspend it seconds later.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders said on Thursday they looked forward to seeing proposals on taxing online giants by early 2018 but in a nod to concerns from countries like Ireland said EU efforts had to be in line with work under way at a global level.

European countries are split over whether online companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon should pay more tax, with smaller EU members such as Ireland and Luxembourg - which host many online businesses - worried that taxes would hurt their competitiveness without a global solution.

Countries like Italy and France on the other hand are frustrated by the low tax rates online giants pay by re-routing profits through low-rate countries and insist the EU should go it alone if the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States and Japan, is unable to reach an agreement on a global solution.

Meeting for an EU summit, the leaders said in their conclusions that they looked forward to “appropriate (European) Commission proposals by early 2018.”

However they referred to the need to ensure a “global level-playing field in line with the work currently under way at the OECD”, a change from earlier draft summit conclusions which did not mention “global” or link the OECD work to EU efforts.

An EU diplomat said French President Emmanuel Macron - who has led the charge for more taxation of digital giants - was told to wait for OECD proposals in April 2018.

Last month the European Commission outlined three options for taxing internet companies: taxing the turnover rather than the profits of digital firms, putting a levy on online ads and imposing a withholding tax on payments to internet firms.

In the longer term the EU wants to change existing taxation rights to make sure digital firms with large operations but no physical presence in a given country pay taxes there instead of being allowed to re-route their profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

The EU wants member states to reach a compromise by December, will then base its proposals on what they agree to, and will also send those proposals to the OECD.

However, the EU faces the prospect of countries opposed to the measures blocking the move as states have a veto on tax matters.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA) on Thursday rejected U.S. proposals to increase North American content for autos produced in the region and require, under a new NAFTA deal, that half of all content come from the United States.

AMIA President Eduardo Solis said the rules of origin enshrined in the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have been key in creating value and integrating the auto industries of Canada, the United States and Mexico.

“Our position is to not touch the methodology or the rules of origin that have allowed this sector to be successful in the three countries,” Solis said at an event in Mexico City.

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed raising the amount of NAFTA content in autos to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.

Those demands to reserve the lion’s share of automotive manufacturing for the United States helped cast a pall over a fourth round of talks to revamp the 23-year-old accord underpinning $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.

Solis called the U.S. proposal for country-specific content rules unacceptable, saying it violated World Trade Organization rules.

The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up. At 31 times the next 12 months’ estimated earnings, it trades at a higher multiple than Visa or MasterCard. Justifying such a rapid rise requires Chief Executive Dan Schulman to execute well on four crucial strategies.

PayPal’s split from eBay in 2015 helped the company to capture multiple tailwinds as consumers increased their shift toward more convenient payment options than cash and checks – and grew increasingly impatient with the slow pace of technological change at traditional banks. The rise of e-commerce has helped, too. The biggest benefit, however, is the growth of smartphones.

Mobile transactions are growing about 50 percent annually, and now account for more than a third of volume, according to the company. PayPal’s Venmo service has even faster velocity. It’s a payments-cum-social media service that lets people send money to each other for free and post comments about what it’s for. Venmo handled $9 billion of payments last quarter, 93 percent more than the same period last year.

Trouble is, Schulman’s outfit gets precious little financial benefit for this service. Charging merchants to take Venmo payments, a service which launched this week, should change that. The risk is that the millennials who made the person-to-person feature so successful may balk at paying stores in the same manner.

Schulman’s second challenge is to ensure PayPal’s burgeoning lending business doesn’t overheat. The company’s loan portfolio now exceeds $6 billion, but the bigger it gets, the more investors will worry about rising defaults, which could drive down PayPal’s stock multiple. He also needs to make progress on his goal of increasing average usage of PayPal from two to three times a month toward his aspirational goal of two to three times a week.

Finally, Schulman needs to renegotiate the firm’s contract with eBay that expires in 2020. That accounted for 22 percent of revenue last year. There’s a lot of mutual dependence that ought to mean the odds of a split are low. But eBay has plenty of options. That Square could lose Starbucks and Costco could ditch American Express should convince Schulman to tread carefully.

He does, though, have momentum on his side. The future is his to lose.",Breakingviews - PayPal’s future rests on striking quadruple whammy,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-hldg-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-paypals-future-rests-on-striking-quadruple-whammy-idUSKBN1CO33D

“TEMPESTADE – PLANETA EM FÚRIA”

- Os trailers promocionais de “Tempestade – Planeta em Fúria” resumem bem os 109 minutos de duração do filme-catástrofe, no qual os efeitos especiais desempenham cada vez mais protagonismo, relegando a segundo plano roteiros criativos e interpretações convincentes.

No filme de Dean Devlin (produtor de “Independence Day” e “Godzilla”), o tema é a destruição do planeta por fenômenos naturais, controlados graças a um sistema internacional de satélites, monitorados por uma estação espacial que intervém para evitar cataclismos, como enchentes, tornados, tempestades de neve, superaquecimento.

O criador do sistema é Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler), cientista durão que coleciona inimigos e acaba por ser afastado do comando do projeto. Mas falhas suspeitas o reconduzem à operação: uma vila no Afeganistão é destruída por congelamento, Hong Kong sofre com o superaquecimento e até o Rio de Janeiro está ameaçado. Para impedir que o sistema entre em colapso e destrua o planeta, ele terá que contar com a ajuda do irmão, Max (Jim Sturgess), com quem está rompido e que trabalha no governo americano, e da namorada de Max, Sarah (Abbie Cornish), da equipe de segurança do presidente.

“BOM COMPORTAMENTO”

- O ator Robert Pattinson, a esta altura, já deixou para trás o famoso vampiro da série “Crepúsculo” e, a cada novo filme, se estabelece como um ator sério e comprometido. Em “Bom Comportamento”, ele é um ladrão de banco não muito competente com um irmão com problemas mentais (Benny Safdie) que coloca em risco todo um roubo.

Dirigido pelos irmãos Benny e Josh Safdie, o filme é uma homenagem à urgência de um cinema americano dos anos de 1970 – como “Um Dia de Cão” e “Taxi Driver” – e se transforma numa longa jornada noite adentro quando o protagonista tenta salvar o irmão, que acabou preso.

A dupla de diretores dirige com pulso firme e cria um filme tingido por tons de luzes de neon, seguindo uma tentativa desesperada de seu personagem de salvar o seu mundo, que está ruindo. Tudo funciona muito bem, mas nada teria dado certo não fosse a inspirada interpretação de Pattinson. É com ele que o filme realmente pulsa.

“DE VOLTA PARA CASA”

- Reese Witherspoon é Alice, filha de um diretor de cinema cult, em crise no casamento, que, perto de completar 40 anos, muda-se de Nova York para Los Angeles para morar na casa de infância e enfrenta as dificuldades habituais para reiniciar a vida, com as duas filhas.

Alice conhece em um bar três cineastas, que estão na cidade em busca de produtores para rodar seu primeiro filme, e acaba se envolvendo com Harry (Pico Alexander), o jovem diretor da turma. O fato de ele ser muito mais novo deixa Alice em conflito, mas não impede que o affair se prolongue em sua casa, já que ela concorda em hospedar o trio de amigos, que não têm para onde ir.

A mãe de Alice, Lillian (Candice Bergen), musa dos últimos filmes do marido, é quem mais estimula a permanência dos estranhos em casa. E a experiência parece agradar a todos, menos Austen (Michael Sheen), o marido de Alice que está em Nova York e, enciumado, decide aparecer e reconquistar a mulher.

É muita confusão para Alice administrar nessa comédia romântica na qual ela não é mais a jovenzinha de “Legalmente Loira”, mas continua uma mulher atraente e apaixonante, sempre no centro das atenções.

“A GUERRA DOS SEXOS”

- Em 1973, o tenista Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell) desafiou publicamente a tenista Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) a uma partida para provar que os homens eram melhores do que as mulheres. Naquele momento, ela era uma das maiores do mundo e ele havia sido um campeão passado, mas agora esquecido.

Dirigido por Valerie Faris e Jonathan Dayton (os mesmos do cult “Pequena Miss Sushine”), mais do que recriar aquela partida icônica, o filme reconstrói um momento da história da luta das mulheres pela igualdade que ecoa até hoje. Se o resultado da partida é mais do que conhecido, o longa investe nos bastidores e na posição de cada um dos esportistas.

Carell encontra um meio-termo entre a caricatura e o grotesco de Bobby, que se auto-intitulava um “porco chauvinista”. Já Emma brilha como a tenista inteligente que luta por melhores condições de trabalho para as mulheres. Dadas as circunstâncias, não é difícil torcer por ela.

“A COMÉDIA DIVINA”

- Livremente inspirado em um conto de Machado de Assis (“A Igreja do Diabo”), o diretor Toni Venturi – mais conhecido por filmes densos com temática política, como “Cabra cega” –, envereda pelo humor negro em “A Comédia Divina”. Um dos méritos do filme é escancarar de forma ácida o shopping center da fé, escalando o próprio diabo para inaugurar sua congregação religiosa, quando percebe que está perdendo adeptos e, com isso, tendo sua imagem enfraquecida, o que não é nada bom para os negócios em tempos de redes sociais.

Outro mérito é escalar Monica Iozzi para o papel de Raquel, que se deixa seduzir pelo demônio (Murilo Rosa) e acaba, ingenuamente, ajudando-o em sua estratégia de marketing, como repórter de uma emissora de TV. E nesse ponto o filme mostra como o marketing está por trás de tudo, principalmente das causas indefensáveis.

Ao entrevistar o capeta, sem se dar conta Raquel dá início ao plano diabólico para torná-lo uma celebridade e enaltecer a luxúria, a gula, a soberba, a vaidade e os demais pecados capitais. No Paraíso, Deus (Zezé Motta) deixa a história rolar, a espera que os próprios mortais percebam a enrascada em que estão se metendo ao frequentar a nova igreja. Mas um antigo namorado de Raquel, Lucas (Thiago Mendonça), que também trabalha na emissora de TV, pode ter a chave para enfrentar o demônio. No céu, Deus só observa.

(Reuters) - Lyft Inc has raised $1 billion in fresh financing, the ride-services company said on Thursday, in a round led by one of Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) investment funds, further complicating the convoluted world of ride-hailing alliances and dealing a blow to rival Uber Technologies Inc.

The round was led by CapitalG, the growth investment fund of Alphabet that has also backed large private tech companies such as home-renting platform Airbnb and payments firm Stripe. Six months ago, Lyft raised $600 million from a conglomeration of investors. Lyft said the latest round boosts its valuation to $11 billion from $7.5 billion.

CapitalG partner David Lawee will join the company's board, Lyft said, bringing it to a total of 10 directors. (lft.to/2zB1NCw)

“Ridesharing is still in its early days and we look forward to seeing Lyft continue its impressive growth,” Lawee said in a statement.

Lyft, which runs a distant second to Uber [UBER.UL], has pushed expansion this year. The company says it is available across 41 states and completes more than a million rides a day

Lyft is deepening ties to Alphabet despite its partnership with General Motors Co (GM.N), which has invested $500 million. GM president Dan Ammann told Reuters this week that any further plans to collaborate with Lyft were “not defined at this time.”

Lyft and Alphabet already have a relationship through a partnership Lyft struck with Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit, in May. The two companies are collaborating on bringing autonomous vehicle technology to market, but have not provided many details.

Spokespeople for Lyft and Alphabet have said the latest investment will not have any bearing on the Waymo partnership.

Alphabet also has ties to Uber through its second investment arm, GV. GV invested in Uber in 2013, but then Uber began to develop autonomous cars and compete directly with Alphabet.

Last year, Alphabet executive David Drummond stepped down from the Uber board. This year Waymo sued Uber, alleging trade secret theft, in a case that is set to go to trial in December.

“It is another punch by Alphabet at Uber,” said Erik Gordon, an entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

GV could have the opportunity to sell at least some of its stake in Uber in a highly anticipated deal between Uber and SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), which may be finalized in the next week. SoftBank wants to buy between $7 billion and $10 billion in shares from Uber employees and investors.

Uber has also been embroiled in sexual harassment claims, lawsuits and U.S. Department of Justice investigations over its business practices.

Bill Maris, founder of GV who has since left to run his own venture capital firm, told Reuters last week there is a strong case for GV to sell.

“It is completely rational to me as an investor to take all of the money off the table now given all of the drama, all of the toxicity, all of the DOJ investigations,” he said.

But Maris and other Uber investors are conflicted, saying the company still has the potential to be worth $100 billion or more.

“This thing likely goes up from here,” Maris said.

Lyft is close to hiring an initial public offering advisory firm, the first concrete step by the company to become publicly listed.

This funding round may delay those IPO plans, however, as the capital will allow Lyft to continue growing its business privately.

“We will go public when it’s right for us,” said Lyft spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna.",Alphabet's CapitalG leads Lyft's $1 billion funding round,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lyft-ipo-investors/alphabets-capitalg-leads-lyfts-1-billion-funding-round-idUSKBN1CO2BZ

(Reuters) - The California Department of Insurance said on Thursday its preliminary estimate for insured wildfire losses was $1.05 billion, based on claims received by the state’s eight largest insurers, adding that it expected the numbers to rise.

Insurers have received 601 claims for commercial property losses, 4,177 claims for partial residential losses and 3,000 claims for auto losses, said California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones during a media call.

Since erupting on Oct. 8 and 9, the blazes in parts of Northern California have blackened more than 245,000 acres, (86,200 hectares) and destroyed an estimated 6,900 structures as of Thursday, including homes, wineries and other commercial buildings.

More than 15,000 people remain displaced, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said on Thursday.

A fire that started Monday in the Santa Cruz Mountains now threatens 300 homes, Jones said.

Residents of Northern California’s wine country left homeless by the state’s deadliest-ever wildfires could be temporarily housed in federal government trailers, officials said on Wednesday, as the death toll from the blazes rose to 42.

Moody’s Investor Service estimated insured losses at $4.6 billion on Monday, based on an earlier figure of 5,700 destroyed structures, according to a report.

Insurer Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N), which announced its third quarter results on Thursday, also warned investors of large claims likely this quarter from the wildfires.

The company paused a share repurchase plan in September to conserve cash as it reviewed claims from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which made landfall in September and October, and it is still evaluating that position in the light of wildfire claims, said Travelers Chief Executive Alan Schnitzer on a conference call with analysts.

State Farm is California’s largest homeowners insurer and sixth-largest commercial fire insurer, according to a Moody’s analysis.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

“iPhone 8 demand has been naturally soft out of the gates with the main event being the iPhone X launch in early November. (But) this is the early innings of what we believe is the biggest iPhone product cycle with X leading the way.”

U.S. wireless carrier AT&T said last week its third-quarter postpaid handset upgrades were down by nearly 900,000 from a year ago.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.",'Anemic' iPhone 8 demand drags Apple shares lower,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/anemic-iphone-8-demand-drags-apple-shares-lower-idUSKBN1CO1E7?il=0

Lin, who was diagnosed with a ruptured patella tendon of the right knee, landed awkwardly and crumpled to the floor after driving to the basket for a layup in the fourth quarter of the Nets’ 140-131 loss to the host Indiana Pacers on Wednesday.

The 29-year-old guard, who had 18 points and four assists in 25 minutes, immediately clutched his knee and said “I‘m done” before bursting into tears and being helped off the court.

“Jeremy worked tremendously hard during the off-season and in training camp and was excited for the prospects of the team this season,” Nets General Manager Sean Marks said in a statement.

Lin, the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, went from an unknown professional basketball player to an overnight sporting sensation in 2012 when he led a winning turnaround for his former New Knicks team.

He averaged 20.9 points and 8.4 assists per game in February of that year while leading the Knicks to 10 wins in a 13-game stretch that overwhelmed New York City and caught the imagination of Knicks fans.

(Reuters) - Protesters shouted “Go home Nazis” as a white nationalist gave a speech on Thursday at the University of Florida, where hundreds of police set up barricades and separated supporters and demonstrators to guard against violence.

Richard Spencer’s event at the university in Gainesville, which prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency to prepare for possible conflict, came about two months after rallies by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to a deadly clash with counter-protesters.

The violence on Aug. 12 added fuel to a national debate on race, and Republican President Donald Trump came under fire for blaming both sides for the melee.

White supremacists have been working to bring Spencer to various public universities, saying he has a constitutional right to free speech. The effort has forced college leaders to allow what they see as hate speech on campus and provide security to prevent violent clashes.

On Thursday, several hundred protesters shouting “We don’t want your Nazi hate” marched outside a campus performing arts center where Spencer spoke.

Two people were arrested, including a man hired as security for media for illegally carrying a firearm on campus, the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said. Another man wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with swastikas emerged from a crowd of protesters with a bloody lip.

“There were a few scuffles, but for the most part it was an extremely peaceful event,” said Chris Sims, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office.

Inside the venue, Spencer and protesters yelled at one another, and he criticized them for trying to suppress his speech.

“I’m not going home,” said Spencer, who heads the National Policy Institute, a nationalist think tank, and promoted the Charlottesville rally. “We are stronger than you and you all know it!”

A man walks with a bloody lip as demonstrators yell at him outside the location where Richard Spencer, an avowed white nationalist and spokesperson for the so-called alt-right movement, is delivering a speech on the campus of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, U.S., October 19, 2017.

He appeared to have few supporters in the crowd. About 15 white men, all dressed in white shirts and khaki pants, raised their hands when Spencer asked who identified with the alt-right, a loose grouping characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

Spencer left the campus soon after the event ended, university public safety officials said on Twitter. Police worked to separate those who attended the event as they left the venue from protesters gathered nearby.

One Spencer supporter appeared to have been sprayed in the face with an irritant. Police were not immediately available to speak about the incident.

Anais Edwards, 26, was inside the venue and supported those trying to disrupt Spencer.

“I’m really proud of how our community came together. Many of them were willing to stand up and not let him speak,” Edwards said.

The university said it did not invite Spencer to speak, but was obligated by law to allow the event. The school said it would spend more than $500,000 on security, and the National Policy Institute is paying more than $10,000 to rent the facility and for security within the venue.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors U.S. hate groups, said Spencer is “a radical white separatist whose goal is the establishment of a white ethno-state in North America.”

An outspoken supporter of Trump during the 2016 campaign, Spencer rose from relative obscurity after widely circulated videos showed some Trump supporters giving Nazi-style salutes to Spencer during a gathering in Washington to celebrate the Republican candidate’s win. Trump condemned the meeting.

The death in Charlottesville, home to the flagship campus of the University of Virginia, occurred as counter-protesters were dispersing.

Separately, Britain’s banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was in contact with two UK banks over any possible links to the Gupta family.

The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing. Gupta family spokesman Gary Naidoo could not be reached for comment and the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria had no immediate comment.

The family, founders of a business empire spanning media, mining and consulting, have been named in a trove of leaked emails alleging graft in dealing with South Africa’s state-owned companies, which also named several global firms.

Related Coverage StanChart closed accounts linked to South Africa's Gupta family in 2014

The Financial Times, which cited “people familiar with the matter”, said U.S. investigators had been looking at individuals, bank accounts and companies in the U.S. for ties to alleged graft involving the family. It gave no further details.

Britain’s FCA said it was in contact with HSBC and Standard Chartered banks following reports in British newspapers that the finance minister had asked regulators to investigate the lenders’ possible ties to the Gupta family and Zuma.

“The FCA is already in contact with both banks named and will consider carefully further responses received,” the regulator said.

Standard Chartered in London said they were not able to comment on details of client transactions but added that ”after an internal investigation, accounts were closed by us by early 2014”. HSBC said it had no comment on the matter.

Britain’s parliament is expected to discuss British banks’ possible involvement in the Gupta case on Thursday.

Zweli Mkhize, one of several potential candidates to replace Zuma as head of the African National Congress in December, said the United States and Britain were within their rights to investigate.

“If there is any information suggesting corruption or irregularities, it needs to be investigated across the borders. It should not be restricted to South Africa,” he told reporters.

The Guptas and their companies have not been charged with any crime in South Africa, but the scandal is one of many that have dogged the Zuma presidency.

In Guadalajara, Jalisco’s capital, a new group devoted to recruiting startups expects to have 10 new companies in the region by year-end, with another 60 in the pipeline. And the landlord of choice for many startups, the shared-office juggernaut WeWork, said it has opened five locations and now serves 6,000 workers after debuting in Mexico City last September.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to reduce immigration to the United States, including new constraints on H-1B visas for skilled workers - which many tech companies rely on for attracting foreign talent - have prompted countries ranging from China to Canada to step up recruiting tech workers and startup companies that might once have found a home in the United States.

For Mexico, there is an added urgency: more than 600,000 immigrants of Mexican origin are currently covered by the U.S. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which offers protection from deportation for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children.

Those individuals, known as “Dreamers,” may soon have to look for work abroad as a result of the Trump administration’s September decision to let DACA expire.

“This may be a good soft landing for people who are incredibly well prepared and may be able to take advantage of building their American Dream back in Mexico,” said Bismarck Lepe, chief executive of Wizeline, a San Francisco tech firm with 260 employees in Mexico City and Guadalajara.

Wizeline has invited Dreamers, who could now face deportation, to apply for jobs that would allow them to work in Mexico for a year before obtaining the necessary visa to return to the United States. Wizeline plans to use the L1 and TN visas, the latter of which is a visa covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows citizens of Canada and Mexico to work in the United States for business purposes.

To be sure, it is not yet clear if the benefit to Mexico’s tech industry will be deep or long-lasting. The fate of the Dreamers remains uncertain as Congress could still pass legislation continuing the program.

Mexican government statistics have not so far shown an uptick in temporary residence cards granted to foreign workers, suggesting that most prospective U.S. H-1B visa applicants are not yet looking south.

SIMPLE PITCH

Nonetheless, Mexico’s tech sector has been adding jobs at a healthy rate in recent years, and all signs point to continued strength.

Software job growth this year in Mexico’s three largest metropolitan areas - Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey - hit 8.8 percent, 7 percent and 10 percent, respectively, according to data compiled by LinkedIn.

That is up from respective annual growth of 6.8 percent, 4.6 percent and 6.8 percent in 2016, LinkedIn told Reuters.

“Where there is a strong engineering presence and opportunity, at some point it makes more sense to go to the market itself and establish an office there,” said Steve McPherson, senior manager of software development for Amazon.com. The company has not disclosed the size of its technical team in Mexico, but McPherson said it is hiring aggressively.

Facebook, meanwhile, has launched three programs this year in the Mexican capital, including a partnership with Dev.F, a local coding academy. These programs are the groundwork for a potential tech expansion into Mexico by the world’s largest social media network, said Dev.F co-founder Manuel “Eme” Morato. Facebook now has close to 100 employees in Mexico.

In Guadalajara, local nonprofit StartupGDL launched a program earlier this year to attract young, high-growth potential tech startups to the region.

The pitch is simple: universities in Jalisco graduate between 7,000 and 8,000 engineers each year. The cost of living and wages are low by comparison to Silicon Valley. Guadalajara offers direct flights to the Bay Area and is only two hours ahead of California. And immigration into Mexico is easy for tech workers.

Thus far in 2017, five foreign companies have opened offices in Guadalajara, according to StartupGDL, and the organization expects three to five more by year-end.

“I look for people who are mission-focused, and I saw a lot of that down there,” said Pat Calhoun, chief executive of Espressive, a Santa Clara, California, tech firm that opened an office in Guadalajara in March.

Pablo Lemus, mayor of Zapopan, a city in Jalisco that is home to companies including Oracle and the electronics manufacturer Flex, estimates that 40 to 50 startups may open offices in the city this year and next.

DREAMER OPPORTUNITY

Some companies are focused specifically on recruiting Dreamers.

“They are highly capable people, bilingual in most cases, who have a very valiant experience,” said Luis Aguirre, vice president of government relations for contract electronics manufacturer Sanmina Corp (SANM.O), which has a large presence in Jalisco. “We will be gaining a great pool of talent.”

Zapopan has begun a campaign to attract Dreamers, placing brochures in Mexican consulates in the United States, said Lemus, the mayor.

Employment in the tech sector in Jalisco has climbed steadily in recent years and is projected to reach 115,000 jobs in 2017, up from 105,000 in 2015, said Jaime Reyes, the state’s secretary of innovation, science and technology.

The state is set to capitalize even further as Trump’s immigration crackdown takes effect, Jalisco Governor Aristóteles Sandoval told Reuters, even though some tech companies are keeping quiet about their plans in the delicate U.S. political climate.

Firms outside the United States are trying to capitalize on the Trump administration’s changes to the H-1B visa program, which has become a much slower and more cumbersome route to obtaining a U.S. work permit. This year, applications for H-1B visas declined for the first time in five years.

Satyen Timbadia, an Indian who owns a midsize IT outsourcing company in Mexico, said the H-1B restrictions influenced his decision to expand a planned engineering and design center in Guadalajara, which will accommodate 250 to 300 workers.

“Trump has done only one thing – make life easier for us,” said Timbadia, CEO of Daksha Consulting.

At Wizeline, one of the key benefits of operating in Mexico has been the ability to attract and relocate foreign workers. Since opening offices there in 2014, the company has brought in workers from France, India and China, and other countries.

In August, Wizeline relocated Egyptian software engineer Kareem Salah, 22. Salah was able to move to Mexico from Egypt within a month of graduating from college in Cairo and getting a job offer from Wizeline.

“It was extremely easy,” Salah said.",Mexico tech industry benefits from U.S. anti-immigration stance,https://www.reuters.com/article/trump-effect-mexico-tech/mexico-tech-industry-benefits-from-u-s-anti-immigration-stance-idUSL2N1M92F6

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When reporters descended on upstate New York to ask about a stunning prison break in 2015, state police spokesman Major Charles Guess took their questions.

A dog named Trigger stepped on his owner’s 12-gauge shotgun during an Indiana waterfowl hunt just months later and shot her in the foot.

Sometimes the name fits the news story. Correspondent Julie Weed writes about legal marijuana for Forbes. This month, a front-page New York Times story on obesity was edited by Hilary Stout.

And former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner on Monday was sentenced to prison for sending explicitly sexual pictures of a certain body part to an underage girl.

This phenomenon has secured its own line of scientific research, called nominative determinism. It even has a name of its own: aptronym.

In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.

Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.

But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other U.S. Major League Baseball teams.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s high price tag could weigh on demand.

The chief executive of Rogers Communication, Canada’s largest mobile network, on Thursday said appetite for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which went on sale in September, had been “anemic,” the latest sign of weak sales for those phones ahead of the Nov. 3 launch of the pricier iPhone X.

But some analysts said overall phone production looked in line with their earlier expectations, and that it is unclear whether weak iPhone 8 sales would hurt iPhone revenue and margins because users may still be buying more profitable older models with more memory.

Verizon Communication Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said the number of third-quarter phone upgrades fell versus previous years, but that he expected an upgrade surge when the iPhone X is released.

“I think what you’re seeing there is a difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we’ve historically seen,” Ellis told an earnings call.

“As we get into the holiday season, some of those new devices come out, we think we will see strong demand.”

The uncertainty about demand coupled with a Taiwan media report of a cut in iPhone 8 production pushed Apple shares down 2.8 percent by midday.

“The Street is hyper-sensitive to any speed bumps around this next iPhone cycle and (that) speaks to the knee-jerk reaction we are seeing in shares,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights in New York.

SUPPLY CHAIN

Apple no longer gives regular updates on sales numbers, but indications from supply channels, wireless carriers and analysts help shed light on demand.

When Apple announced the plan to release both phones before the end of 2017, fans were disappointed they would have to wait until November for the iPhone X.

But there are also concerns that the more expensive phone marking the iPhone’s 10th anniversary may see a muted reception compared to the frenzy that normally greets Apple phone launches.

A carrier store survey suggested the cheaper iPhone 7 was outselling its successor just a month after iPhone 8’s launch, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said this week.

But it can be hard to gauge iPhone revenue and profits from model sales numbers alone because Apple can earn attractive margins when customers switch into higher-memory devices, said Wayne Lam, analyst with IHS Markit.

“They’ve always been able to use that as a lever to improve their profitability on the iPhone,” Lam said.

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.",'Anemic' iPhone 8 demand drags Apple shares lower,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/anemic-iphone-8-demand-drags-apple-shares-lower-idUKKBN1CO1E7

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party.
Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council.
What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did.","President Donald Trump’s opening speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday is drawing widespread criticism for his aggressive statements about North Korea and Iran, but it is just as significant for what he didn’t mention at all.

In a 42-minute address that stunned many listeners, Trump called the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man on a suicide mission” and vowed to “totally destroy” the country if it attacks the United States. He promised to crush “loser terrorists.” He called the Iran nuclear deal an “embarrassment” and said portions of the world are “going to hell.”

The overarching theme of Trump’s speech was sovereignty – a word he used 21 times. It was a strange emphasis in an increasingly interconnected, globalized world. Though in line with his ""America first"" platform, it was highly unusual for a U.S. leader speaking in a global forum that stands for peace through cooperation. What Trump left out was just as important: he did not offset his emphasis on sovereignty — with its implication that what a nation does within its borders is of no concern to the international community — with an assertion of the primacy of universal human rights or Washington’s commitment to promoting democracy.

Indeed, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, their vast ideological differences notwithstanding, sounded far more similar to each other when addressing the UN than Trump did to either of them or his other predecessors.

The three most glaring omissions were climate change, human rights and Russia’s efforts to destabilize Western democracies. Trump’s ignoring climate change was no surprise, given his rejection of climate science and planned withdrawal from the UN-sponsored Paris climate agreement. President Obama, by comparison, frequently argued for international climate cooperation in his UN speeches.

But the other subjects Trump avoided were less expected. American commitment to helping the UN advance human rights has long been a staple in UN addresses by presidents, no matter their political party. Although Trump said that he intends to work hard on an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal at a Wednesday meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the fact that a settlement wasn’t mentioned during the UN address suggests the issue is no longer a White House priority.

In his UN speech Trump also offered no direct condemnation of China or Russia, despite their recent actions that have undermined — and antagonized — the United States on the world stage.

These omissions were a stark departure from past U.S. presidents. Though Trump’s condemnation of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela echoed Bush’s “axis of evil,” Bush’s annual UN addresses promoted the spread of democracy and nation-building abroad. Obama, meanwhile, emphasized diplomacy and international institutions to resolve conflict, achieve peace and protect human rights.

Any call for the respect of rights in Trump’s speech was reserved for nations, not people. “Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity, and peace, for themselves and for the world,” he said, adding that he expects nations to “uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.”

For all the president’s focus on sovereignty, he ignored threats to from Russia, such as its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and hacking of French election infrastructure.

As for China, Trump made only a vague reference to its threat in the South China Sea, where Beijing has built up islands and military outposts in an area the United States regards as international waters. Trump did, however, thank both Russia and China by name for their recent UN Security Council votes for more sanctions on North Korea. His choice of words could perhaps be interpreted as recognition of how much he will need their support facing down the Kim regime.

Trump’s only explicit mention of human rights was to condemn — without naming names — the “governments with egregious human rights records” that sit on the UN Human Rights Council. China and American allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the obvious suspects. (Trump did say, “We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela,” but his overwhelming focus regarding Venezuela was on attacking its socialist economy.)

He did not raise the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where more than 420,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh in what the United Nations called “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Calling out Myanmar would have carried little political risk for Trump and would have gone a long way toward pressuring the country to drop its brutal campaign.

The focus on sovereignty conjured a picture of a world where every nation only looks out for itself. It is also a world where the United States abandons its role as a leader.

What Trump did not say, therefore, is just as much of a threat to human rights as what he did. He repeatedly extolled the virtues of strong nations over strong international institutions and held up the nation-state as “the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.” What’s unclear just how this is supposed to work. His rhetoric of sovereignty gives oppressive regimes permission to violate their citizens’ rights, and tells the rest of the world it’s okay to turn a blind eye.","Commentary: At the UN, Trump’s silences spoke volumes",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karas-trump-commentary/commentary-at-the-un-trumps-silences-spoke-volumes-idUSKCN1BW2AC

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior White House aide said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets.

Marc Short, the White House’s top liaison to Congress, said on CNN that Obamacare’s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal.

“We’re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we’re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,” Short said.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving the subsidies, which Trump has discontinued, for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage.

The bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on Thursday after several Republican senators said they would support the measure. But Short’s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement. Democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of Obamacare.

Short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the bill’s co-authors and would likely make them public.

“The gist is we believe that the individual mandate should (be) repealed, employer mandate repealed and allow Americans to contribute to health savings accounts,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Alexander and Murray said the deal they struck now has the support of 12 of the 52 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate, as well as 12 Democrats.

While Alexander predicted in remarks on the Senate floor that the plan “will become law in some fashion before the end of the year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is against it.

Lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the Senate floor tucked inside a bigger “must-pass” bill that Congress needs to act on in December, such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown.

Trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. But his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra-party divisions.

Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance to 20 million people but Republicans call it government interference in Americans’ healthcare.

The law’s individual mandate requires all Americans to purchase health insurance, while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage.

TRUMP REVERSES POSITION

Trump initially indicated support for the Alexander-Murray agreement but reversed himself, saying on Wednesday “I can never support bailing out” insurers.

Senator Mike Rounds, one of the bill’s Republican co-sponsors, said that if Trump decides he does not support it, “then it will not go forward.” When a reporter noted that Trump does oppose it, Rounds replied, “That was yesterday.”

Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, who focuses on healthcare, said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing, with Trump “flip-flopping every day” and Ryan not supportive of the bill.

Among hospital stocks, Community Health Systems (CYH.N) closed up 3.7 percent, Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) rose 2.9 percent and HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA.N) gained 3 percent. Most insurers rose more modestly.

Without the subsidies, insurance premiums for some of the 10 million Americans who get coverage through Obamacare markets will surge. Noting that some conservative Republicans object to the subsidies, Alexander asked, “What’s conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy insurance, or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created?”

The bill has broad support among Democrats, but had just seven Republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier.

Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, who co-authored a bill in September to repeal and replace Obamacare that failed to muster enough support, endorsed the bipartisan effort.

“We believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long-term solution” that would overhaul Obamacare, they said in a joint statement.

If passed in December, as opposed to before the Nov. 1 beginning of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare insurance policies, it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year, meaning its benefits might not be felt until 2019. Insurers have already decided whether to participate in the Obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish.

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

The bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

Many Senate Republicans are nervous about the prospect of voting on any healthcare measure - no matter what legislation it may be attached to - that buttresses Obamacare.

Part of the fear, one senior Senate Republican aide said, is that Trump’s former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is recruiting hard-line conservative primary challengers to run against incumbent Republican senators next year. The aide said incumbents do not want to be forced to cast a controversial vote to stabilize Obamacare, a law reviled by many conservatives.

If all 46 Senate Democrats and two independents back the Alexander-Murray bill as expected, the support of the 12 Republicans means the bill has the 60 votes needed to reach the super-majority required to pass most legislation in the Senate.

Trump on Thursday underscored his concerns about the bill. He urged Alexander and Murray to be “careful with respect to the insurance companies,” which he said are “extremely talented at making money.”

Alexander and Murray said their legislation does not bail out insurers. Alexander said House Republicans passed an Obamacare repeal and replace bill in May that also would continue subsidy payments for two years.

Alexander said Trump has called him four times in recent days on this subject, including a Saturday night call when he was at a restaurant and “my dinner got cold.” He urged the president to support the initiative.",White House says rollback of Obamacare must be part of short-term fix,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/white-house-says-rollback-of-obamacare-must-be-part-of-short-term-fix-idUSKBN1CO2N7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

There are also worries that the relatively high price of the iPhone X may discourage carriers from stocking the inventory and customers from ultimately buying the phone.

Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said anticipation for the iPhone X was high but noted inventory would be limited and that, at Apple’s starting price of $999, it was an expensive device.",'Anemic' iPhone 8 demand drags Apple shares lower,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/anemic-iphone-8-demand-drags-apple-shares-lower-idUSKBN1CO1E7

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese officials on Thursday heaped praise on President Xi Jinping’s political ideology, unveiled a day earlier at a key Communist Party Congress, a sign that it could be enshrined in the party’s constitution and further cement his power.

Some ruling Communist Party officials were moved on Thursday to song, dance and tears in adulation of Xi, a day after he opened the twice-a-decade conclave pledging to build a prosperous “modern socialist country” for a “new era”.

Three outgoing members of the elite seven-man Politburo Standing Committee that Xi heads lauded “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.

Such statements indicate that Xi could cement his power with his new eponymous slogan being incorporated into the party’s constitution. Whether the theory is included bearing his name will be a key measure of his status, analysts have said.

No other leader has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.

Xi is poised to begin a second five-year term next week.

Party officials hailed Xi as a wise and great “lingxiu”, or leader, a reverent honorific bestowed on only two others: Mao and his short-lived successor Hua Guofeng - another sign that Xi has accumulated more power than his immediate predecessors and could revive a party chairmanship as a precursor to staying on in some capacity beyond the end of his second term in 2022.

“Xi Jinping... has obtained the heartfelt love and respect of the entire party, army and people, he deserves to be called wise leader,” Beijing party secretary Cai Qi, a Xi ally and one-time colleague, said on Wednesday at a meeting of the city delegation, according to the official Beijing Daily.

Officials lavishing praise on the party’s top leader at a congress is not unusual, but overt displays of emotion or personal adulation are rare.

One female delegate from the southern province of Jiangxi broke into song to praise Xi’s treatment of ethnic minorities, while another from Guangdong province said that, listening to Xi’s speech, her eyes had brimmed with tears.

“I feel that the reason for my country’s accomplishments is fundamentally the helmsmanship of Xi Jinping,” said Jing Junhai, Beijing’s deputy party chief, invoking a phase often used to describe Mao.

The 64-year-old Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, tightening controls on civil society, revamping the military and asserting China’s rising might on the global stage.

Some party officials painted Xi as a saviour.

“Because of the Party Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping as its core, in five years, the party has been saved, the army has been saved, the country has been saved,” Liu Shiyu, head of China’s securities regulator, said on Thursday.

Others were more restrained.

Hu Chunhua, party chief in Guangdong province and a potential contender for a spot on the new Politburo Standing Committee to be revealed next week, simply referred to Xi as general secretary and did not mention his theory during an open session on Thursday, in contrast with more than a dozen other delegates who spoke. State media reported that he had praised Xi’s theory the day before.

NEW IDEOLOGY, MORE POWER

The exact meaning of Xi’s new banner term is not yet clear, although it is not unusual for Communist Party leaders to announce lofty slogans and then fill in the details as they go.

An ideology named after Xi to guide China and the party would further consolidate his power, said Ryan Manuel, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Hong Kong.

“This is a good umbrella for him to just keep saying whatever he wants and the system having to respond and study it,” he said.

Xi’s immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have had their ideological concepts enshrined in the constitution, but not their names.

The party gave Xi the title of “core” leader a year ago, a strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, adding to speculation that Xi could retain power beyond a customary second term and even revive Mao’s chairman title.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA) on Thursday rejected U.S. proposals to increase North American content for autos produced in the region and require, under a new NAFTA deal, that half of all content come from the United States.

AMIA President Eduardo Solis said the rules of origin enshrined in the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have been key in creating value and integrating the auto industries of Canada, the United States and Mexico.

“Our position is to not touch the methodology or the rules of origin that have allowed this sector to be successful in the three countries,” Solis said at an event in Mexico City.

Under NAFTA, at least 62.5 percent of the material in a car or light truck made in the region must be from North America to be able to enter the marketplace tariff-free.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed raising the amount of NAFTA content in autos to 85 percent and securing 50 percent of the total for the United States.

Those demands to reserve the lion’s share of automotive manufacturing for the United States helped cast a pall over a fourth round of talks to revamp the 23-year-old accord underpinning $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.

Solis called the U.S. proposal for country-specific content rules unacceptable, saying it violated World Trade Organization rules.

SÃO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - O ex-presidente do Comitê Olímpico do Brasil (COB) Carlos Arthur Nuzman tornou-se réu sob a acusação de intermediar a compra de votos para que o Rio de Janeiro fosse escolhido sede dos Jogos Olímpicos de 2016, nesta quinta-feira, poucas horas depois que o Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ) decidiu pela liberdade do ex-dirigente.

O ex-governador do Rio Sergio Cabral e o ex-diretor de marketing do COB Leonardo Gryner também viraram réus no processo.

De acordo com a decisão do juiz federal Marcelo Bretas, que recebeu a denúncia feita pelo Ministério Público Federal, os procuradores conseguiram delinear a autoria e a materialidade dos crimes que teriam sido cometidos e, portanto, a ação deve ser admitida.

“Verifico, ainda, estarem minimamente delineadas a autoria e a materialidade dos crimes que, em tese, teriam sido cometidos pelos acusados, o que se afere do teor da documentação que instrui a exordial, razão pela qual considero haver justa causa para o prosseguimento da ação penal”, disse o juiz em sua decisão.

Na quarta-feira, o MPF apresentou denúncia contra Nuzman por corrupção, organização criminosa, lavagem de dinheiro e evasão de divisas.

Nuzman foi preso pela Polícia Federal em 5 de outubro acusado de intermediar a compra de votos de dirigentes africanos, por meio dos senegaleses Papa Massata Diack e Lamine Diack, na eleição realizada pelo Comitê Olímpico Internacional (COI) em 2009, com dinheiro proveniente do esquema de corrupção liderado pelo então governador Cabral, que está preso.

Segundo a denúncia, os dirigentes esportivos e o então governador viabilizaram pagamento de 2 milhões de dólares do empresário Arthur Soares aos senegaleses para garantir a vitória do Rio de Janeiro. Soares também virou réu nesta quinta.

A defesa de Nuzman afirmou que a acusação é destituída de justa causa e não tem fundamento.

“Responderemos em 10 dias, a partir do momento em que sejamos cientificados, e o próprio juiz poderá reconhecer a inanidade, a inapetência e o vazio da acusação”, disse o advogado criminalista Nélio Machado, um dos defensores do ex-presidente do COB.

Poucas horas antes do despacho de Bretas, o STJ concedeu liberdade a Nuzman, em decisão liminar tomada por unanimidade. Entre as medidas cautelares impostas ao ex-dirigente estão proibição de acesso às dependências do Comitê Rio 2016 e do COB, suspensão de qualquer exercício de atividade nos dois comitês e proibição de se ausentar da Comarca do Rio de Janeiro.

(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name.

Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Thursday reaffirmed their full commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, hoping that the U.S. Congress would not let it collapse despite relentless criticism by President Donald Trump.

But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran’s ballistic missile program and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East.

Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.

“We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,” said the bloc’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini.

The EU leaders’ joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday, “reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal”.

The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall.

Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a program the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.

The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said.

Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would “shred” it.

The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea.

In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile program and its regional political role.

“We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don’t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,” an EU official said.

“If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic program and Iran’s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.”

Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile program would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

The EU, which has expressed “concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions” in the Middle East, has said these issues should be discussed without direct links to the nuclear deal.

A mudança nas regras de fiscalização tem sido alvo de fortes críticas de entidades envolvidas nessas discussões, como o Ministério Público, auditores fiscais, que têm pregado um boicote às alterações, a Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) e a Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT).

O ministro do Trabalho, Ronaldo Nogueira, esteve nesta quinta-feira no Palácio do Planalto para relatar ao presidente Michel Temer a conversa com Raquel Dodge. Segundo uma das fontes, Nogueira se comprometeu com a procuradora-geral em fazer modificações no texto.

Ainda assim, o governo defende a portaria e não considera que houve retrocesso.

“A lei que pune o trabalho escravo está em vigor, a publicação da lista suja está em vigor”, defendeu uma das fontes. “O que acontece hoje é que quando vai para a Justiça não têm provas, não têm indícios e acaba com ninguém preso. Agora, por exemplo, a Polícia Federal vai participar de todas as ações.”

Ronaldo Nogueira prepara um vídeo para ser divulgado nas redes sociais em breve a fim de explicar o conteúdo da portaria. No governo, há uma avaliação de que é preciso esclarecer as mudanças feitas.

O texto publicado pelo Ministério do Trabalho restringe, por exemplo, a publicação da lista suja ao determinar que só possa ser feita por ato do ministro, tirando autonomia da área técnica. Além disso, na avaliação do Ministério Público Federal e do Ministério Público do Trabalho, a nova portaria dificulta a comprovação do crime ao limitar o trabalho escravo ao cerceamento de liberdade.

Em uma análise de quatro páginas, o MP recomendou a revogação da portaria e deu 10 dias para que o Planalto desse uma resposta.

Na conversa com Nogueira, a procuradora-geral afirmou, segundo nota da PGR, que “a portaria volta a um ponto que a legislação superou há vários anos” e afirmou que estaria aberta a discutir propostas para melhorar a legislação.

Dodge deverá esperar a resposta do ministério sobre o texto a fim de decidir que medida poderá adotar, segundo uma fonte ligada à procuradora-geral. Não está descartado recorrer à Justiça para barrar a portaria, mas, por ora, a tendência é se buscar um aprimoramento da norma.

The president is required by Article Two of the Constitution to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So are his efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional?

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the CIA said on Thursday a U.S.-Canadian couple kidnapped by Islamist militants in Afghanistan were held inside neighboring Pakistan for five years before being freed.

“We had a great outcome last week when we were able to get back four U.S. citizens who had been held for five years inside of Pakistan,” CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington.

Pompeo’s remarks appeared to be the first time a U.S. official has publicly stated that the couple and their children spent their captivity in Pakistan, contrary to accounts from Pakistani officials.

Pakistan’s military and government have indicated U.S. citizen Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their children were rescued shortly after entering Pakistan from Afghanistan. The couple were kidnapped in 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan and their children were born in captivity.

U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have previously said there was no indication the hostages had been in Afghanistan in the days before they were freed.

The officials said the United States believed the hostages were probably held by the Haqqani militant group in or near its headquarters in northwestern Pakistan the entire time.

Regarded as the most fearsome and effective Taliban ally, the Haqqani network gets support from elements of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan’s powerful military-run intelligence agency, U.S. officials say. Pakistan denies it.

A senior Pakistani security source said last Friday that Pakistani troops and intelligence agents, acting on a U.S. intelligence tip, zeroed in on a vehicle carrying the family as they were being moved into the Kurram tribal region near the town of Kohat, some 60 km (37 miles) inside Pakistan.

Pakistani officials bristle at U.S. claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants, particularly the Haqqanis.

After the release of the family, Pakistani officials emphasized the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington, which has threatened to cut military aid and take other punitive measures against Pakistan.

However, two Taliban sources with knowledge of the family’s captivity said they had been kept in Pakistan in recent years.

The Haqqani network operates on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border but senior militants have acknowledged they moved a major base of operations to the Kurram region.

As part of a strategy unveiled in August to end the war in Afghanistan, the Trump administration is demanding Pakistan cease providing what U.S. officials say is safe haven to militants, or face repercussions. Those measures could include further cuts in U.S. assistance and sanctions targeted at Pakistani officials with links to militant organizations.

‘VERY FRUSTRATED’

Pompeo’s remarks came ahead of a visit to Pakistan next week by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said on Wednesday the United States expected Pakistan “to take decisive action against terrorist groups.”

A senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday the United States considers the family’s rescue a “template for more cooperation” by Pakistan.

“We see this as a first step and we hope that we can build on it,” said the official, adding that Washington is “very frustrated that Taliban and Haqqani militants continue to find sanctuary in Pakistan.”

“It’s freedom of movement, it’s the ability to transport weapons and materiel, the ability to raise funds. This is what makes a sanctuary,” the official added.

SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin launched one of his most stinging critiques of U.S. foreign policy on Thursday, listing what he called some of the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.

He declined to say if he would run for a fourth presidential term in an election set for March, though he is expected to stand after dominating Russian politics for 18 years.

Instead, he used a high-profile televised discussion with foreign academics in southern Russia to reach back to what he regards as the darkest days of U.S.-Russia relations.

Opinion polls suggest that harsh rhetoric towards the West plays well with many Russian voters, who credit Putin for restoring national pride and standing up to what they see as Western encroachment.

Asked by a Germany-based academic to identify what mistakes Moscow had made in its relations with the West, Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi:

“Our biggest mistake was that we trusted you too much. You interpreted our trust as weakness and you exploited that.”

Visibly angry at times, Putin cast Russia as the wronged party and its post-Soviet leadership as too naive and trusting.

“Unfortunately, our Western partners, having divided the USSR’s geopolitical legacy, were certain of their own incontestable righteousness having declared themselves the victors of the ‘Cold War,'” said Putin.

“They started to openly interfere in the sovereign affairs of countries and to export democracy in the same way as in their time the Soviet leadership tried to export the Socialist revolution to the whole world.”

Putin said U.S.-Russia relations were in a lamentable state, referencing an “unprecedented” anti-Russian campaign in the United States, the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities there and pressure on Russian media by U.S. authorities.

He did not single out U.S. President Donald Trump for personal criticism, but said Trump’s behavior was unpredictable as a result of political foes who were preventing him from fulfilling almost all of his policy pledges.

LITANY OF U.S. SLIGHTS

Putin said the United States was trying to squeeze Russia out of European energy markets with its latest batch of sanctions, which Trump grudgingly signed into law in August after Congress approved them.

“The recent sanctions package adopted by the U.S. Congress was openly designed to push Russia out of European energy markets and to force Europe to switch to more expensive liquefied natural gas from the United States, even though the volumes there are not yet sufficient,” he said.

He criticized Trump’s predecessors, describing how he believed the United States had betrayed Russia in the 1990s by not reciprocating what he called the unprecedented access Moscow gave Washington to Russia’s secret nuclear facilities.

He said the United States had flouted nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, saying Moscow had diligently complied with the same pacts only to be repeatedly let down by the United States.

His speech and ripostes in a punchy question and answer session that followed often sounded like a history lesson.

The United States had tried to stir up separatism in southern Russia in the 1990s, said Putin, something he said he knew for a fact from his stint leading the FSB spy agency.

The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and NATO’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia were bad, he said.

And in comments that could have been drawn straight from the pages of the Cold War, Putin accused the United States of upsetting the strategic nuclear balance by modernizing its arsenal of weapons.

Russia would develop new weapons systems, he pledged, if it was forced to, and if the United States withdrew from a landmark arms control treaty -- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- Russia would hit back fast.

“From our side, the response will be instant, and I want to warn, symmetrical,” said Putin.

But the bloc, reluctant to isolate itself completely from Washington, is also stepping up criticism of Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its role in what the West sees as fomenting instability in the Middle East.

Trump last week adopted a harsh new approach to Iran by refusing to certify its compliance with the nuclear deal, struck with the United States and five other powers including Britain, France and Germany after more than a decade of diplomacy.

“We fully stay committed to the complete implementation by all sides of the Iranian nuclear deal. We see this as a key security interest for the European Union and the region,” said the bloc’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini.

The EU leaders’ joint statement, agreed after talks in Brussels on Thursday, “reaffirms full commitment to the Iran nuclear deal”.

The bloc has been stepping up efforts to save the deal, saying it was crucial to regional and global security, and it has appealed to the U.S. Congress not to let it fall.

Trump has given Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran, lifted under the pact in exchange for the scaling down of a programme the West fears was aimed at building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran denies.

The EU leaders also highlighted the need to protect their companies and investors dealing with Iran from any adverse effects should Washington reinstate the sanctions, officials said.

Should Trump walk away from the deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran would “shred” it.

The bloc sees the agreement as a chief international success of recent years, and fears tearing it apart would hurt its credibility as well as harming diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions around a nuclear stand-off with North Korea.

In outlining his tougher stance, Trump said Tehran must also be held accountable for advancing its ballistic missile programme and its regional political role.

“We will defend the nuclear deal and stand by the nuclear deal and implement the nuclear deal. But we also don’t want to be standing on a completely opposing side to the U.S.,” an EU official said.

“If they withdraw, we would be left in a rather interesting company with China and Russia. So there may be an issue of separating the nuclear deal from the ballistic programme and Iran’s regional role, sending signals on the latter two.”

Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) said on Thursday the ballistic missile programme would accelerate despite U.S. and EU pressure to suspend it, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, urged voters in New Jersey to reject the “politics of division” by supporting Democrats in next month’s state elections.

Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama said New Jersey could send a powerful signal about the type of politics it wants by voting for Democrat Phil Murphy in the Nov. 7 governor race.

“You’re going to send a message to the country and send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division, we are rejecting a politics of fear, that we are embracing a politics that says everybody counts,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark that chanted: “Four more years.”

It was the first of two public appearances by Obama on Thursday on behalf of Democratic candidates for governor. He will appear later in Richmond, Virginia. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states holding elections for governor this year.

Those contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can turn the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections.

The two governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could be a preview of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers.

Obama made his comments just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took a thinly veiled swipe at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade. [L2N1MU1XD]

Trump’s combative style and inflammatory comments have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions.

Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies.

But in New Jersey, Obama focused on urging supporters to turn out their friends and families to vote. Democrats hope Obama can help bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections.

‘CAN‘T TAKE ELECTION FOR GRANTED’

Opinion polls show Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the New Jersey lieutenant governor, who is hindered by the unpopularity in the state of Trump and Republican Governor Chris Christie.

But Obama said no one should assume a victory is in the cards, making an indirect reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race.

“You can’t take this election or any election for granted. I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said.

Obama will appear on Thursday night in the political battleground of Virginia, which is viewed as a potential bellwether. Opinion polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump.

Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016.

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia’s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.

“If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia’s foreign ministry.

“Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.”

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper’s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine.

Titled “Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,” the note said it was sent from North Korea’s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia’s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them.

DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name.

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North’s leader Kim Jong Un a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.

The letter calls for “countries loving independence, peace and justice” to discharge their duty and keep “sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.”

At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an “unprecedented” communication.

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

“The cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,” said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

”Hey Amazon, we need to talk,“ ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. ”We’re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.

A mudança nas regras de fiscalização tem sido alvo de fortes críticas de entidades envolvidas nessas discussões, como o Ministério Público, auditores fiscais, que têm pregado um boicote às alterações, a Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) e a Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT).

O ministro do Trabalho, Ronaldo Nogueira, esteve nesta quinta-feira no Palácio do Planalto para relatar ao presidente Michel Temer a conversa com Raquel Dodge. Segundo uma das fontes, Nogueira se comprometeu com a procuradora-geral em fazer modificações no texto.

Ainda assim, o governo defende a portaria e não considera que houve retrocesso.

“A lei que pune o trabalho escravo está em vigor, a publicação da lista suja está em vigor”, defendeu uma das fontes. “O que acontece hoje é que quando vai para a Justiça não têm provas, não têm indícios e acaba com ninguém preso. Agora, por exemplo, a Polícia Federal vai participar de todas as ações.”

Ronaldo Nogueira prepara um vídeo para ser divulgado nas redes sociais em breve a fim de explicar o conteúdo da portaria. No governo, há uma avaliação de que é preciso esclarecer as mudanças feitas.

O texto publicado pelo Ministério do Trabalho restringe, por exemplo, a publicação da lista suja ao determinar que só possa ser feita por ato do ministro, tirando autonomia da área técnica. Além disso, na avaliação do Ministério Público Federal e do Ministério Público do Trabalho, a nova portaria dificulta a comprovação do crime ao limitar o trabalho escravo ao cerceamento de liberdade.

Em uma análise de quatro páginas, o MP recomendou a revogação da portaria e deu 10 dias para que o Planalto desse uma resposta.

Na conversa com Nogueira, a procuradora-geral afirmou, segundo nota da PGR, que “a portaria volta a um ponto que a legislação superou há vários anos” e afirmou que estaria aberta a discutir propostas para melhorar a legislação.

Dodge deverá esperar a resposta do ministério sobre o texto a fim de decidir que medida poderá adotar, segundo uma fonte ligada à procuradora-geral. Não está descartado recorrer à Justiça para barrar a portaria, mas, por ora, a tendência é se buscar um aprimoramento da norma.

No Planalto, no entanto, a tendência não é de revogar totalmente a portaria, como gostaria a PGR, diz uma das fontes.

Um dos setores mais atingidos pela legislação que trata do trabalho escravo, a bancada ruralista no Congresso Nacional, tem interesse especial no texto.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday geared up to vote on an amendment that would block drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, with opponents of the measure saying development would lead to jobs and wealth creation.

Conservationists covet the reserve, also known as ANWR, in northern Alaska, home to tribes that hunt and fish and also a habitat for sensitive wildlife including caribou, polar bears and hundreds of species of migratory birds.

Many Republican senators hope to open a portion of the reserve called the 1002 area. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chair of the Senate energy committee and a Republican from Alaska, called this a “non wilderness area” because the federal government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration.

The budget instructs Murkowski’s committee to raise $1 billion over 10 years and she hopes some of that could come from opening the 1002 area. She urged senators to see the “instruction as an opportunity to do something constructive” and focus on boosting energy output from federal lands to bring new wealth.

Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy committee, introduced the amendment that would strike the instruction to raise the funds from energy production.

Republicans were attempting a “sneak attack” that would turn “public lands over to polluters”, she said. Senator Jeff Merkley, another Democrat, has said there is “something cynical and sad” about the effort top open ANWR because it would boost oil output from the state feeling the fastest effects of climate change, which a majority of scientists link to carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and development.

If there’s been one common thread running through almost every industry in the last decade, it has been how a handful of tech firms have revolutionized how the world does business. There’s Google for accessing information; Twitter for sharing opinion and news; Facebook for interacting with friends; Amazon for shopping, AirBnB for places to stay and Uber for getting around.

Until relatively recently, most consumers and governments took this as a positive trend. While there were disputes over individual and limited issues – not least the companies’ unwillingness to pay tax or comply with requests from local regulators – they usually were seen as good for the economy and job opportunities. With their slick lobbying and PR operations, the tech entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were courted by politicians and civil society alike.

That is changing. The decision by London authorities to strip Uber of its license to operate in the British capital is part of a wider backlash in a rapidly escalating war between governments and the tech firms they believe have become too powerful and contemptuous of rules and democratic authority. Uber and its biggest rival Lyft were ejected from the Texas capital of Austin last year for refusing to fingerprint their drivers. In 2013 in San Francisco and Oakland, tech giants such as Google and Apple’s private employee buses, which were illegally using public bus stops, were blocked by protesters.

Other cities are clearly watching carefully. New York’s city regulators said Monday they were looking at their own probe into Uber, looking specifically at its impact on the city’s own yellow cab sector.

Political perceptions of these tech firms are changing too. After the so-called “Arab Spring,” many Western governments – and the Obama administration in particular – openly praised the tech firms as being a positive global influence, helping democratize the world.

That assumption unraveled as the same platforms later fueled the rise of far right parties in Europe and the Trump presidential campaign. Under Congressional pressure, Facebook voluntarily turned over details of 3,000 election-related ads that appeared to have been paid for by Russia-linked buyers.

Such scrutiny may only be the beginning. Increasingly, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are being blamed for seismic changes in Western political systems, accused of allowing themselves to be hijacked by automatic bots and hardliners to radicalize politics and often spread extremism.

Getting too close to tech firms now brings its own political dangers. U.S. think tanks that happily embraced funding from Google now find themselves criticized for it, accused of reining in any debate critical of the company and its counterparts.

Instead of spreading opportunity, such firms are increasingly blamed for killing jobs. Amazon’s success is at the heart of what trade analysts referred to as the “retail apocalypse,” the shutting of growing numbers of stores across the United States and beyond. Uber has proved toxic to more tightly controlled taxi industries. The drivers of London’s famous black cabs have been particularly hard hit, and their aggressive lobbying of politicians is seen as one of the key factors behind London mayor Sadiq Khan’s decision to suspend Uber’s operating license.

The decision proved immediately contentious. For all the criticisms of Uber – that it ignores regulators and the employment rights of those who drive for it, and that there have been reports of abuse and sexual assaults by drivers – it has slashed transport costs for its users. It has also provided opportunities – although without much in the way of job security – for hundreds of thousands around the world. An Uber-launched petition to reverse the London ban quickly notched up 600,000 signatures.

For the firms themselves, this is a familiar dynamic. Facebook, Google and Twitter in particular have been tangling with national governments since they began operating in relatively autocratic countries such as Russia, China and those in the Middle East, where those in authority have long felt threatened by the quick and easy access they offer to information. Sometimes, the tech companies have found themselves blocked outright.

Increasingly, the perception has become that many of these firms are simply willing to push their luck to see what they can get away with.

Technology firms do have a difficult balance to strike. Google, Apple and others have long made a virtue of protecting user data against what they see as overly intrusive requests for access by authorities. In some areas, the rights and wrongs are arguable. In others, however – such as the payment of tax – governments and campaigners believe the issues are much more clear-cut.

In many respects, Uber and AirBnB are seen amongst the most egregious examples of companies that have seriously and deliberately pushing the limits of what is strictly legal. While London’s already more stringent taxi regulation means Uber needs a license, in many other cities both it and its drivers operate outside the conventional taxi licensing system. AirBnB lets out rooms in cities that explicitly ban short-term rentals. Both have based their entire business model on working around, if not entirely flouting, pre-existing local regulations. Authorities often seemed to lack the ability, or the political will, to enforce the rules.

The London Uber decision is perhaps the most significant escalation in that war so far. It’s not that the firm will necessarily be ultimately banned from the streets, as it will continue to operate pending an appeal. The most likely scenario is that the firm and regulators reach a deal – although that could be a difficult process.

Early signs are that the firm is indeed willing to compromise. On Monday, its chief executive sent London authorities a contrite letter saying that the firm realized it had to change. Mayor Khan welcomed the statement, saying he favored talks to resolve the issue.

What Khan – a fast-rising star within the opposition Labour Party – has demonstrated, however, is that the firm can only operate if authorities allow it to do so. It is fundamentally replaceable – indeed, that have already been suggestions that a quickly-formed rival with better employment and safety practices might take its place. Something similar happened in Austin: although the Texas state government overruled the ban on Uber and Lyft in May, both companies now face more local competition.

Giant tech firms are unlikely to go away. But neither are national or local governments, democratically elected or otherwise. With a host of new technologies coming down the line – self-driving cars, automatic shops, artificial intelligence – many controlled by the same companies, these fights are only going to get bloodier.",Commentary: Uber’s London fight a sign of tech battles to come,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-uber-commentary/commentary-ubers-london-fight-a-sign-of-tech-battles-to-come-idUSKCN1C223I

TORONTO (Reuters) - Black people in Canada’s most populous province spent longer behind bars awaiting trial than white people charged with many of the same categories of crimes in each of the past five years, according to data obtained by Reuters.

Between April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.

The data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)

Among the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.

In three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.

The data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.

Reuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.

A spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.

More than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.

Unlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.

A surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.

Current and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.

HARDER ON THE POOR

Critics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.

“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”

The data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.

Reuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.

Studies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.

This makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.

In a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.

The court did not address race in its ruling.

Investors have been anxious to hear who President Donald Trump will pick as the nominee. A decision like Powell would likely be a continuation of the current stock market-friendly monetary policy that has helped fuel the market’s more than eight-year bull run.

Stocks had been recovering from early losses for much of the afternoon but the S&P 500 and Dow were still a tad lower just before the Powell report.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I can’t observe any other reason for why we ended up.”

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of (current Fed Chair) Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove ... and, with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber-accommodative monetary policy, as more welcome than the alternative,” he said.

Powell was among several names circulating as possible picks, including Yellen. Others include Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

The White House on Wednesday said Trump will announce his decision on the matter in the “coming days.”

Tech shares were among the day’s biggest drags, led by Apple (AAPL.O), which fell 2.4 percent in its biggest daily percentage decline since Aug. 10 as doubts about its double 2017 iPhone release strategy weighed on investors.

Der Konzern teilte mit, zur Umsetzung der Strategie “Vision 2020” gehöre, die strategische Aufstellung der Geschäfte kontinuierlich zu überprüfen. “Das kann die Konsolidierung einzelner Aktivitäten einschließen, wenn es die Marktbedingungen erforderlich machen.” Finanzvorstand Ralf Thomas hatte im Sommer einen Kurswechsel in der Kraftwerkssparte namens “Power & Gas (PG)” angemahnt. “Wir haben ein hartes Jahr vor uns”, sagte der Manager damals. “Strukturelle Veränderungen werden unvermeidbar sein.” Das “Manager Magazin” berichtete vorab, bis zu elf der 23 Standorte weltweit sollten geschlossen oder verkauft werden. Besonders hart solle es die ostdeutschen Werke treffen.

Siemens laboriert im Geschäft mit Kraftwerkstechnik daran, dass die großen Turbinen, auf die man in München bisher gesetzt hat, kaum noch gefragt sind. Seit der letzten, vor zweieinhalb Jahren eingeläuteten Sparrunde brach die Nachfrage überraschend schnell weg; kombiniert mit hohen Überkapazitäten im Markt rauschten die Preise in die Tiefe. Zudem sieht sich Siemens technologisch derzeit von US-Konkurrent GE überrundet und erst ab 2019 wieder selbst vorn. Im dritten Quartal des Geschäftsjahres verbuchte die Kraftwerkssparte 41 Prozent weniger Neuaufträge. Der Gewinn sackte um fast ein Viertel ab, die Rendite von 11,1 auf 9,7 Prozent. Analysten von Barclays hielten im Lichte der “dramatischen Veränderungen” im Markt weitere Konsequenzen für erforderlich.

Die IG Metall sieht dies anders: Da mit einem “sehr stattlichen Gewinn für das Gesamtjahr” zu rechnen sei, müsse es “einem Unternehmen wie Siemens auch einmal möglich sein, potenzielle Probleme zu ertragen, bis eine wirklich tragfähige und nachhaltige Lösung gefunden ist”. Bei PG werde derzeit noch das Programm für 2020 umgesetzt, “das dann offenbar die versprochene Wirkung weit verfehlt”. Siemens hatte angesichts des Ölpreis-Verfalls schon in den vergangenen Jahren zahlreiche Stellen in der Kraftwerkssparte abgebaut. Derzeit arbeiten dort weltweit rund 30.000 Menschen, davon rund 12.000 in Deutschland.

In der Sparte Automatisierungs- und Antriebstechnik hatte sich Siemens vor gut einem Jahr mit Arbeitnehmervertretern auf die Streichung von 1700 Stellen in Deutschland geeinigt. Damit fiel der Jobabbau etwas geringer aus als zunächst angekündigt: Siemens hatte wegen der niedrigen Nachfrage aus der Bergbau- und Ölindustrie ursprünglich 2000 Jobs in Deutschland streichen wollen, weltweit 2500.

Die Pläne für die weitere Sparrunde will die Konzernspitze den Arbeitnehmern Anfang November im Wirtschaftsausschuss vorstellen, wie das “Manager Magazin” weiter schrieb. Die IG Metall wurde am Donnerstag von den Berichten kalt erwischt und konnte die Informationen nicht bestätigen. Die Gewerkschaft fordert den Siemens-Vorstand auf, rasch für Klarheit zu sorgen. “Wir finden es unerträglich, dass erneut tausende Mitarbeiter auf diese Weise verunsichert werden.”",Insider - Siemens läutet neue Sparrunde ein - Erneut Jobabbau,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-siemens-idDEKBN1CO26M

BOSTON (Reuters) - Mitch Golden scrutinizes hedge fund managers and their investment ideas in a variety of settings from the back of a motor scooter in Ho Chi Minh City to a park bench in New York’s Central Park. The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said she would spend Friday ironing out issues and ministerial posts with coalition partner New Zealand First, one day after becoming the Pacific nation’s youngest leader in more than 150 years.

The previous night’s highly anticipated announcement by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters that he would support 37-year-old Ardern’s Labour Party had ended a decade of center-right National rule and spelt big changes for the country’s economy.

The New Zealand dollar - the world’s 11th-most traded currency - was down 1.7 percent, after its largest one-day fall in more than a year amid jitters around the new government’s protectionist agenda.

The country’s stock market fell 1.1 percent when it opened on Friday morning.

Ardern told Radio New Zealand on Friday that her party would meet to decide ministerial posts in the afternoon, though it had already offered the deputy prime minister role to Peters and was waiting for his decision.

She confirmed that most of the party’s flagship policies, including a ban on some foreign ownership of housing, had survived the negotiations with Peters in recent weeks.

“With New Zealand First we’ve got a few more details to iron out,” Ardern said. “Our plan remains, with a few minor changes ... we’re finalising in the next 24 hours the detail of both agreements.”

The inconclusive election on Sept. 23 had thrust the country into political limbo for almost a month with neither major party winning enough seats to form a majority and giving New Zealand First the balance of power.

New Zealand First and Labour also needed support from the progressive Green Party, which said it would strike a “confidence and supply” agreement, meaning it was officially outside government but would hold ministerial posts and vote on key pieces of legislation like the budget.

On Thursday evening, Labour said it would also stick to its promises to change the central bank’s mandate and seek to renegotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel refused to give up on the Formula One championship on Thursday and found support from title favorite Lewis Hamilton.

Hamilton leads the German by 59 points with four races left and the Mercedes driver can take his fourth championship in Sunday’s U.S. Grand Prix if he finishes in the top two and results go his way.

“In English, they say it’s not over until the fat lady sings,” Vettel told reporters in the U.S. Grand Prix paddock. “We need to make sure she shuts up for quite a while.”

Vettel led the championship from the opening race in Australia in March until last month but three races in the Far East and Hamilton’s string of wins have shredded his chances.

The Ferrari driver was caught in a collision with team mate Kimi Raikkonen in Singapore and crashed out on the opening lap, then suffered an engine failure in qualifying in Malaysia that left him last on the grid.

He raced back to fourth that time but in Japan was sidelined by a broken spark plug.

“We are still in there, our chances are slimmer than they have been some races ago. There is a chance. We’re going for it,” said the four times world champion.

“We need to stay focused. We have a great car, we had a package to win the last couple of races. As it happens, we didn’t. But that doesn’t mean we have no chance to win the next races.”

Hamilton, who has won in Austin four times in the last five years, said talk of wrapping up the title in Texas - as he did two years ago - was overblown.

“I think the talk of the championship win this weekend is silly really...you can’t expect them to have a difficult weekend again,” he said.

“They’re going to be quick, they have an opportunity to win. The championship, as long as it’s done in the next four races, that’s my focus. I honestly couldn’t care less if it’s here on the last race, as long as it’s done.”

Hamilton also expected Ferrari to bring some sort of upgrade to Austin.

“They’ve definitely had a couple of hiccups but I anticipate they’ll be very strong this weekend and for the last four races - so that’s why nothing changes for me,” he added.",Motor racing: Vettel hopes to keep the fat lady quiet,https://www.reuters.com/article/motor-f1-usa-title/vettel-hopes-to-keep-the-fat-lady-quiet-idINKBN1CO38T?il=0

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech.
The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech.
The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.
Liberals have a tricky task ahead, to address two different publics: one alarmed by hate speech and militant messages, the other by measures to stop them.","In a flurry of confident pronouncements within an hour of the massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival, conservative commentators and activists linked the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, to liberal or Islamist influences. Rush Limbaugh, still the doyen of right-wing talk radio, credited Islamic State with being Paddock’s ideological home, arguing that it was disguised by the liberal media because “for the American left, there is no such thing as militant Islamic terrorism.” Pat Robertson, the socially conservative activist and televangelist, said the shooting stemmed from the news media’s and liberal protesters’ “profound disrespect for our president” and other institutions.

On the other side of the American culture war, a CBS vice president and legal counsel, Hayley Geftman-Gold, posted a Facebook comment that she was “not even sympathetic” to the victims because “country music fans often are Republican gun toters.” Unlike her right wing opposites, she suffered for her opinion: she was fired from what must have been a lawyer’s dream job.

Should any of these comments ­­­− the work of, at most, a few minutes when not that of a few seconds − be the concern of the state? They easily fall into the category of bad taste. Some remarks, especially Geftman-Gold’s sneeringly callous comment – for which she has since apologized – could cause further misery in those seeking to cope with the trauma of injury or loss of someone close to them.

The general opinion, especially in the United States, is that governments should stay out of it. For Washington, the anger such remarks may rouse and the distress they may cause must be endured in deference to the near-absolute right of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

But should we tolerate such verbal brutality? Can it not be “cured?” Do people have to suffer distress because of the voiced prejudices of others who often – as Limbaugh does – make a rich living from their display? There’s a growing faction saying no, and it has reached, at least in Europe, the stage of state action. The European Union Justice Commissioner, Vera Jourova has told the social media giants, such as Facebook and Twitter, that they must eliminate both hate speech and fake news, or face legislation criminalizing them for not doing so. That’s a sweeping statement: unpacking what it might mean in practice takes us deep into an area which should be marked with signs saying: “Danger! Free speech in Peril!”

Fake news is not the same as hate speech, but it can also be used to inflame social tensions. In Italy, the anti-trust chief Giovanni Petruzella has said that EU countries should create government-appointed bodies to remove fake news and even fine the media for violations. But how is fake news to be distinguished, by either artificial or human intelligence, from true news? It’s a delicate operation, since much news striving to be “true” contains false information, and much fake news has the ring of truth and would take careful investigation to disprove.

In Germany, a new law came into force this month criminalizing some digital platforms being used for hate speech. Called, challengingly, the Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, NetzDG for short, it commands that Facebook and Twitter take down “blatantly illegal” hate speech within 24 hours or, if the offending material is less obviously illegal, in a week – on pain of a fine of up to 50 million euro ($58.6 million). The problem with it, critics claim, is that it is imprecise about what constitutes hate speech. It merely points to the passage in the German Criminal Code which declares the ""defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations"" illegal. What is defamation? When is one person’s unbearable insult another’s opinion?

Sticks and stones may break my bones/But words will never hurt me” has been a comfort of sorts to those who have been the victims of taunting and insult, but modern psychiatry claims it isn’t so. Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University, in a careful parsing of what constitutes harmful speech, argues that “there is a difference between permitting a culture of casual brutality and entertaining an opinion you strongly oppose. The former is a danger to a civil society (and to our health); the latter is the lifeblood of democracy.” Speech of the first kind, which “bullies and torments,” is “from the perspective of our brain cells… literally a form of violence.”

Put that way, it appears obvious: the speech which harms should be criminalized, as much as a physical assault, and in parts of Europe it is being so. Facebook, Twitter and Google are now under increasing state and public pressure to clean up their sites, to stop posting material that causes more than distress but, apparently, real damage to the brain. Embattled UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke out at the United Nations last month, calling on the tech companies to go much further and faster in combating the dangerous messages they carry.

At a background-only session with Google staff in London this past week, where these issues were broached, I was told that the concerns of governments and the public were registered, and reform was on the way.

When I quoted the view of Fiyaz Mughal, head of the anti-extremist British advocacy organization Faith Matters, that the companies with which he had been working are “not dealing with the problem” because their “bottom line is money,” I was met with an assurance that this was not so. The automatic default of the communications behemoths to absolutism in free speech has been replaced, it was said, by a finer-grained examination of cause and effect, and of what could reasonably be done to address concerns.

It’s true that to juggle the demands of free speech and those of security now constitutes one of the largest ethical and practical problems facing democratic states − and the tech corporations. And it’s also true that even if Mughal is right that the companies’ first care is the bottom line – for which corporation is that not true? – the large fines now being prepared for not heeding the call to reform would be a large incentive to change.

Yet in the course of this complex balancing act, between security and liberty, profit and regulation, there is the danger of substantial damage to the freedoms of speech and the news media which democracies have been able to safeguard for most of the post-World War Two period.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly excited about the prospects for much faster growth in the solar power industry in Southeast Asia, which has until now been a backwater for renewable energy.

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do “whatever it takes” to defend world oil prices, it didn’t expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles Police Department said on Thursday that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

The LAPD robbery and homicide division interviewed a potential sexual assault victim, spokesman Kevin Maiberger told Reuters. No further information was given on who made the allegations or where the alleged incident occurred.

“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but he unequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex,” his spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said in an emailed statement.

The move follows allegations reported earlier this month by The New York Times and The New Yorker from a number of women that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

The New York Police Department said last week it was investigating an allegation of sexual assault from 2004 against Weinstein.

The Los Angeles Times newspaper said Thursday that the allegation made to the LAPD came from an unnamed well-known Italian model and actress, who told police detectives that Weinstein raped her in a room at a Beverly Hills hotel after a film event in February 2013.

Maiberger said he could not verify the details reported by the Los Angeles Times of the alleged victim or the incident, but said an active investigation was under way.",Los Angeles police investigating Harvey Weinstein in 2013 sexual assault allegation,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CO369-OCAEN

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

“The cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,” said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

HARSH WORDS

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

”Hey Amazon, we need to talk,“ ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. ”We’re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus SE’s deal with Bombardier (BBDb.TO) boosts confidence in the CSeries jet program but may not spur many new sales until it is finalized and a U.S. trade dispute is resolved, the head of a major aircraft leasing firm said on Thursday.

Airbus (AIR.PA) on Monday agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program, securing the plane’s future and giving the Canadian firm a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (BA.N) and U.S. regulators.

The lightweight, carbon-composite jet, which cost $6 billion to develop, has won performance accolades but failed to secure a sale in 18 months.

“People are feeling better about the CSeries but it’s all on the expectation that Airbus concludes the transaction,” said John Plueger, the chief executive officer of Air Lease Corp (AL.N).

The deal is subject to Canadian government approval.

Bombardier is counting on the agreement to help trim costs and boost CSeries sales.

Its strategy to remove the “cloud” of uncertainty that has weighed on CSeries orders, is dependent in part on making jets for American customers like Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) at Airbus’s Alabama production facility, instead of in Canada where Bombardier is based. That could avoid potentially punitive duties stemming from its dispute with Boeing over alleged unfair trade practices.

“That cloud is still there until the transaction concludes.(but) that cloud is perhaps not as dark or as ominous,” Plueger said.

He declined to say whether Air Lease Corp, which has total assets of $15 billion, would now consider buying the CSeries. But he noted that leasing companies would likely hold off until the CSeries had enough orders to ensure strong resale value for the plane.

“Part of the life and blood measurement of any airplane is how deep is the operator base,” Plueger said in a phone interview from New York.

Plueger also said the deal with Airbus may drive Boeing to take another look at the 100 to 149 seat space and at least contemplate an alliance with an existing planemaker, to ratchet up competition. Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) which competes with Bombardier in the smaller regional jets market, is one strong possibility, he said.

“The question is does Boeing rethink Embraer?” Plueger asked. “It will depend upon their assessment of how much additional market presence this brings to Airbus.”",Airbus CSeries deal unlikely to spur quick boost in sales: Air Lease CEO,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bombardier-airbus-boeing/airbus-cseries-deal-unlikely-to-spur-quick-boost-in-sales-air-lease-ceo-idUSKBN1CO31H?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

TORONTO (Reuters) - The death of Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, a music superstar beloved for songs about culture, small towns and hockey, triggered an outpouring of tributes and grief across Canada on Wednesday.

Downie, 53, who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2015, died on Tuesday night surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

Weeping openly, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he had drawn strength and inspiration from the nation’s best known songwriter. At his final concert in August 2016, televised nationally, Trudeau had joined Downie on stage in tribute.

“We are less of a country without Gord Downie in it,” Trudeau said in Parliament.

Downie was known for his frenetic stage presence and telling long stories in the middle of songs. Formed in the 1980s with roots in blues and rock, the Tragically Hip found radio popularity on both classic and alternative rock stations.

The Hip, as it was widely known, held an emotional farewell tour last year after Downie’s cancer was revealed, with the band’s last hometown show in Kingston, Ontario, billed as a national celebration.

On Wednesday, radio stations played Tragically Hip songs as news of his death spread across the country, and tributes poured in on social media as Canadians remembered their encounters with Downie.

The National Hockey League Players’ Association tweeted thanks to Downie, saying his music was “the soundtrack of car rides to practices, bus trips to tournaments, and dressing rooms across Canada. Hockey was part of you and you will always be part of hockey.”

Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, tweeted prayers for Downie’s family, adding that “our hearts break on news of the passing of ... an ally and friend.”

Downie had become an outspoken supporter of Canada’s indigenous people, penning songs about the painful legacy of colonialism and urging Canadians toward reconciliation.

In their statement, Downie’s family said the singer had spent his last days making music and memories with family and friends.

“Thank you everyone for all the respect, admiration and love you have given Gord throughout the years - those tender offerings touched his heart and he takes them with him now as he walks among the stars,” the statement said.","Canada's Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie dies, PM weeps",https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1CN1XZ-OCAEN

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

“The judgment in our favour shows what can be accomplished when a community rallies around something as potentially devastating as fracking,” Janse Rabie, AgriSA’s natural resources chief, told Reuters.

South Africa’s government said in May it might award its first shale gas exploration licences by the end of September, after environmental objections delayed the process.

Royal Dutch Shell, Falcon Oil and Gas and Bundu Gas & Oil are among five companies whose applications were being reviewed by the regulator.

Criticised by environmentalists worried about its ecological impact, fracking involves using water and chemicals at high pressure to crack rock and release the gas.

Campaigners say fracking could threaten the environment of the semi-arid Karoo, famed for its rugged scenery and rare wildlife.

The application to review and quash South Africa’s shale gas regulations, which has been in place since June 2015, was brought by the president of Agri Eastern Cape, together with 15 other applicants, including the agricultural unions of rural towns Graaff-Reinet and Cradock.

“Fracking has the potential to contaminate the groundwater supplies and surrounding environment, which will impact sheep, wool and maize growers,” AgriSA’s Rabie said.",South African court revokes shale gas regulations; AgriSA,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CO0WR-OZATP

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly 340,000 Rohingya children are living in squalid conditions in Bangladesh camps where they lack enough food, clean water and health care, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday.

Up to 12,000 more children join them every week, fleeing violence or hunger in Myanmar, often still traumatised by atrocities they witnessed, it said in a report “Outcast and Desperate”.

In all, almost 600,000 Rohingya refugees have left northern Rakhine state since Aug. 25 when the U.N. says the Myanmar army began a campaign of “ethnic cleansing” following insurgent attacks.

“This isn’t going to be a short-term, it isn’t going to end anytime soon,” Simon Ingram, the report’s author and a UNICEF official, told a news briefing.

“So it is absolutely critical that the borders remain open and that protection for children is given and equally that children born in Bangladesh have their birth registered.”

Most Rohingya are stateless in Myanmar and many fled without papers, he said, adding of the newborns in Bangladesh: “Without an identity they have no chance of ever assimilating into any society effectively.”

Safe drinking water and toilets are in “desperately short supply” in the chaotic, teeming camps and settlements, Ingram said after spending two weeks in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

“In a sense it’s no surprise that they must truly see this place as a hell on earth,” he said.

One in five Rohingya children under the age of five is estimated to be acutely malnourished, requiring medical attention, he said.

“There is a very, very severe risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases, diarrhoea and quite conceivably cholera in the longer-term,” he added.

UNICEF is providing clean water and toilets, and has helped vaccinate children against measles and cholera, which can be deadly, he said.

The agency is seeking $76 million under a $434 million U.N. appeal for Rohingya refugees for six months, but is only 7 percent funded, he said, speaking ahead of a pledging conference in Geneva on Monday.

U.N. agencies are still demanding access to northern Rakhine, where an unknown number of Rohingya remain despite U.N. reports that many villages and food stocks have been burned.

“We repeat the call for the need for protection of all children in Rakhine state, this is an absolute fundamental requirement. The atrocities against children and civilians must end,” Ingram said.

FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - SAP (SAPG.DE), Europe’s most valuable technology stock, predicted a “dynamite” fourth quarter for its cloud computing business, helping its shares erase losses after third-quarter results fell short of market expectations.

The German software maker is in the midst of a transition to offering cloud-based services to business customers, and management had flagged that 2017 would see a trough in profit margins as it invested in datacenters and redeployed staff.

CEO Bill McDermott said SAP was seeing more customers using its new cloud-based S/4HANA business planning products to overhaul their organizations and supply chains. Such large-scale deals tend to close in the fourth quarter.

“You can expect a dynamite Q4,” McDermott told investors on a conference call. “Don’t worry about bookings, relax, it’s going to be terrific,” he said, added that SAP would report “at least 30 percent year-over-year cloud bookings growth”.

SAP shares erased earlier losses of more than 2 percent to trade flat at 1310 GMT following McDermott’s bullish comments. The company, the biggest component of Germany’s blue-chip DAX index, has a market value of 116.5 billion euros ($138 billion).

Third-quarter revenue for the business planning software provider grew 8 percent to 5.59 billion euros ($6.6 billion) from a year earlier, falling short of the mean forecast of 5.71 billion from 16 analysts surveyed by Reuters.

Core profit excluding special items rose by 4 percent to 1.64 billion euros at constant currency rates, below the 1.69 billion expected.

The euro’s strength sliced 4 percentage points off core profit, which was flat after taking currency moves into account. Analysts at Baader Helvea said they expected currency headwinds to continue for the next three quarters.

The company nudged up guidance for full-year core operating profit to between 6.85 and 7.0 billion euros and said 2017 total revenue would range from 23.4 to 23.8 billion, marking year-to-year growth around 6 to 8 percent, excluding currency effects.

IN THE CLOUD

Cloud subscriptions and support revenue rose 27 percent in the quarter to 938 million euros, excluding currency effects, compared with the 29 percent analysts had expected, on average.

This was offset by its classic software license and support business revenue, which rose 4 percent to 3.72 billion euros, slightly above the 2.2 percent growth rate expected.

Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said the slowdown in new orders growth in the last quarter had coincided with accelerated investments in the cloud business.

As this spending rolls off, an improvement in margins will start to shine through in the current quarter, setting the scene for “exponential” growth in gross margins thereafter, he said.

The number of S/4HANA customers rose 70 percent, year-on-year, of which 40 percent were net new customers, SAP said.

The platform drives SAP’s core product offering - delivered via the internet or on-site - but its human resources, travel management and business-to-business marketplace products are still being integrated into it.

Competitors such as Salesforce.com (CRM.N), Workday (WDAY.O) and Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) web services unit offer cloud-only services, challenging the legacy businesses of SAP and its long-time rival Oracle (ORCL.N).

The key question for investors is whether a tipping point is at hand for SAP to return to delivering consistent growth in profit margins late this year or during 2018.

That would reverse five years of declining growth in core profit margins as the company spent heavily to shift its business into the cloud, instead of relying on traditional software license sales for its suite of business planning tools.

SAP management has signaled that its rapid employee expansion since 2015 should slow in coming quarters as its cloud -focused hiring spree runs its course.","Just relax, Europe's tech leader SAP tells investors, fourth quarter will be dynamite",https://www.reuters.com/article/sap-results/just-relax-europes-tech-leader-sap-tells-investors-q4-will-be-dynamite-idINKBN1CO26K

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google is offering security experts a bounty to identify Android app flaws as the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) unit seeks to wipe out bugs from its Google Play store.

Each flaw will score at least $1,000 under the programme announced on Thursday to back up automated checks that have failed to block malware and other problems that security experts say infect the 8-year-old app store far more than Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) rival App Store.

Google will partner with HackerOne, a bug bounty programme management website, to target a list of apps and flaws such as those that allow a hacker to redirect a user to a phishing website or infect a gadget with a virus.

Software scans cannot match a person’s ability to discover “a truly creative hack,” Vineet Buch, director of product management for Google Play Apps and Games, said in an interview.

The Google Play Security Reward Program effectively sponsors research into software created by other companies. Bug bounties by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Apple and Alphabet have been awarded only for tracing flaws in their own software.

“We don’t just care about our own apps, but rather the overall health of the ecosystem,” Buch said. “It’s like offering a reward for a missing person even if you don’t know who the missing person is personally.”

Google did not reveal the funding for its programme, but said it would start small.

Em um ato sem precedentes desde que a Espanha retornou à democracia no final da década de 1970, o primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, anunciou que reunirá seu conselho de ministros em sessão extraordinária no sábado para iniciar os trâmites que levarão a uma intervenção prevista na Constituição espanhola sobre a autonomia da Catalunha.

“O governo da Espanha continuará com os trâmites previstos no artigo 155 da Constituição para restaurar a legalidade no autogoverno da Catalunha”, disse o governo em comunicado.

Em uma carta enviada a Rajoy 10 minutos antes do final de um prazo para que esclarecesse se havia proclamado ou não a independência, de forma que se restaurasse “a ordem constitucional alterada”, Puigdemont admitiu implicitamente que a separação não foi declarada formalmente.

“O governo da Espanha constatou às 10h desta manhã... a negativa do líder do governo da Catalunha para atender o requerimento...”, informou o comunicado de Madri.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whirlpool and GE Appliances asked a U.S. trade panel on Thursday to recommend 50 percent import duties on large residential washing machines to ensure that rivals LG and Samsung follow through on plans to shift washer production to the United States.

At a hearing in a “global safeguard” trade case that could lead to U.S. President Donald Trump imposing steep import restrictions, lawyers for the U.S. producers accused the South Korean companies of being “country hoppers” that have moved output several times to avoid prior anti-dumping duties.

“They have cheated domestic producers before. This is our last chance to get it right,” Whirlpool attorney Jack Levy told the U.S. International Trade Commission.

The commission on Oct. 5 unanimously found that surging imports of large residential washers from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and LG Electronics (066570.KS) were injuring domestic producers. It is scheduled to make remedy recommendations by Dec. 4 to Trump, who is expected to make final recommendation early next year.

Levy argued that a strong remedy would force the South Korean manufacturers to “country hop one more time, to America,” where they would compete more fairly and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base.

Whirlpool and GE Appliances, bought last year by China’s Haier Group (600690.SS)(1169.HK), are also seeking import quotas on key components such as washer cabinets, tubs and basket assemblies to prevent Samsung and LG from opening U.S. “kitting,” or “screwdriver” operations that simply assemble machines largely from imported parts.

Daniel Porter, an attorney representing LG, said a 50 percent duty would severely hurt LG and Samsung by shutting their imports out of the U.S. market until they start U.S. production in 2019. Losses to market share would be difficult to claw back, he added.

Samsung is converting a closed Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) generator factory in Newberry, South Carolina, planned to eventually employ nearly 1,000 workers, while LG is building an all-new factory in Clarksville, Tennessee, that would employ around 600.

Porter said these factories would likely employ fewer workers if import restrictions kept Samsung and LG washers out of the U.S. market for a year.

“Whirlpool’s 50 percent proposal is nothing short of raw, naked protectionism to allow Whirlpool to reach a cash windfall for a year or two,” Porter told the panel.

Both sides brought out members of Congress representing their plant locations to help argue their cases.

“Samsung brought hope, they brought jobs, they put food on the table for many residents,” said Representative Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican.","Whirlpool seeks 50 percent duties on LG, Samsung washers in U.S. trade case",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-whirlpool/whirlpool-seeks-50-percent-duties-on-lg-samsung-washers-in-u-s-trade-case-idUSKBN1CO31Z

Republicans in Congress and the White House haven’t been able to get any major legislation passed yet. But they're betting they can pull it off with a bare-bones proposal for tax reform outlined last week, which they claim will help the middle class despite the evidence that it will overwhelmingly benefit the rich.

Their plan to overhaul what they call a broken tax code leaves out many key details. But one point gets hammered home: Republicans say they want to make filing taxes easier. The first principle for President Trump’s tax plan, their outline states, is to “make the tax code simple, fair and easy to understand.” There are a dozen more references to simplification throughout the rest of the document.

The Republican promise is that they want to make filing taxes as easy as mailing a postcard. But their plan doesn’t get anywhere close to that, while overlooking a straightforward reform that would. Instead of reducing complexity, the GOP plan mostly lowers and flattens rates. For example, it reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three.

However, the effort of filing taxes has nothing to do with how many brackets there are -- figuring out which bracket you fall in is the easy part. What makes doing taxes complicated is figuring out which deductions, credits, and loopholes to claim. Republicans would close some loopholes, but they would open others -- including a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses that will entice rich people with the right accounting team to get creative in order to reap the rewards. (Tycoons with family-owned businesses, such as Donald Trump, especially stand to benefit from this change, which would allow law firms, hedge funds, and real estate brokerages to file under a much lower rate.) Such loopholes make the code more complex to navigate, not less.

Simple tax filing isn’t a hopeless goal, however. There’s something Congress could do that would radically simplify the process of filing taxes for the vast majority of U.S. taxpayers.

It’s called return-free filing. In countries such as Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Spain, the government basically prepares tax returns for its citizens. It already has most of the information it needs: Employers have to tell tax authorities how much they pay their employees, while forms like W-2s and 1099s provide other necessary details. In Japan, for example, the country’s tax agency sends everyone a document with how much they earned, how much was withheld, and how much they owe or are owed in taxes.

If Washington adopted this policy, the government would fill out a return for every resident with the information it already keeps on file. Taxpayers who wanted to itemize their returns or dispute the numbers would be free to do so, but otherwise they could simply sign off on the government’s math. In some countries, merely taking no action constitutes an approval and therefore counts as doing your taxes.

Instead, in the United States it’s up to every taxpayer to gather their forms, enter all the numbers into a long document, ensure that everything has been calculated accurately, and send it all in. It takes a collective 2.6 billion hours to get this done. Americans pay an average $200 each for the pleasure of doing their taxes, or around 10 percent of the average federal tax refund.

Return-free filing, on the other hand, could save an estimated collective 225 million hours of tax filing work and $2 billion in costs. Up to 60 million households would no longer have to file any returns.

The concept is not entirely foreign to the United States. President Ronald Reagan called for something just like it in his 1985 Tax Reform Act, arguing that Americans should “not even have to fill out a return.” Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken up the crusade, introducing legislation two years in a row that would instruct the IRS to develop a free, online return-free filing option, allowing taxpayers to download their information straight from the government and into a form. The idea is even supported by conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist.

But it hasn’t moved forward; last year, Warren’s bill didn’t even make it out of committee.

That’s because some deep-pocketed companies have worked tirelessly to bury it. If most Americans no longer needed help doing their taxes, business would dry up for tax preparers such as H&R Block and TurboTax. More than half of all individual tax returns filed in 2014 were prepared by a tax professional, while about 80 percent of Americans use either software or a preparer.

These companies have said as much publicly. Intuit, the software company that makes TurboTax, has said in filings that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation” and that such legislation “may present a continued competitive threat to our business in the foreseeable future.” Liberty Tax Service stated in 2015 that “demand for our products is related to the complexity of tax return preparation.”

So they’ve spent heavily to campaign against return-free filing. H&R Block, which ProPublica says spent $3 million on lobbying last year, fought hard against Warren’s bill. Intuit spent $2 million in the same year, much of it in favor of legislation that would block the government from offering return-free filing. The firm has lobbied in favor of a number of similar past bills.

Republicans have long claimed that they want to make taxes simpler, yet their proposals never live up to such promises. It’s not impossible, though; the answer is staring us right in the face. It would just require the government to put the interests of everyday taxpayers over big-spending corporate lobbyists.

Na quarta-feira, o MPF apresentou denúncia contra Nuzman por corrupção, organização criminosa, lavagem de dinheiro e evasão de divisas.

Nuzman foi preso pela Polícia Federal em 5 de outubro acusado de intermediar a compra de votos de dirigentes africanos, por meio dos senegaleses Papa Massata Diack e Lamine Diack, na eleição realizada pelo Comitê Olímpico Internacional (COI) em 2009, com dinheiro proveniente do esquema de corrupção liderado pelo então governador Cabral, que está preso.

Segundo a denúncia, os dirigentes esportivos e o então governador viabilizaram pagamento de 2 milhões de dólares do empresário Arthur Soares aos senegaleses para garantir a vitória do Rio de Janeiro. Soares também virou réu nesta quinta.

A defesa de Nuzman afirmou que a acusação é destituída de justa causa e não tem fundamento.

“Responderemos em 10 dias, a partir do momento em que sejamos cientificados, e o próprio juiz poderá reconhecer a inanidade, a inapetência e o vazio da acusação”, disse o advogado criminalista Nélio Machado, um dos defensores do ex-presidente do COB.

Poucas horas antes do despacho de Bretas, o STJ concedeu liberdade a Nuzman, em decisão liminar tomada por unanimidade. Entre as medidas cautelares impostas ao ex-dirigente estão proibição de acesso às dependências do Comitê Rio 2016 e do COB, suspensão de qualquer exercício de atividade nos dois comitês e proibição de se ausentar da Comarca do Rio de Janeiro.

Ele terá também terá que entregar seus passaportes e não poderá manter contato com outros investigados no caso.

Na semana passada, Nuzman renunciou ao cargo de presidente do COB, que ocupava há 22 anos, e nesta semana foi eleito um substituto para ele na presidência do Comitê Rio 2016.",Nuzman vira réu acusado de intermediar compra de votos para Rio 2016; STJ concede liberdade,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idBRKBN1CO36D-OBRSP

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to provide “stronger support” to Italy for its work in Libya and replenish their Africa fund to further curb immigration to Europe.

“We have a real chance of closing the Central Mediterranean route,” chairman Donald Tusk said after 28 EU leaders meeting in Brussels discussed migration, stressing the need to lower the number of arrivals from Africa going through the Mediterranean to Italy.

EU executive European Commission told the group they needed to immediately chip in an extra 225 million euros for migration-related projects in Africa due to run this year and early next.

“If we do want to be as present as possible in Africa - mainly in the Northern part of Africa - we have to increase financial means,” Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said.

Brussels has so far committed 2.9 billion euros to the so-called Africa Trust Fund, with another 234 million euros from EU states, according to the Commission.

Brussels said 1.6 billion euros would be spent by the end of 2017 on Turkey. In 2016 the bloc promised 3 billion euros for Syrian refugees in exchange for Ankara shutting down the route traffickers and smugglers were using to get people to Greece.

Despite sour EU-Turkey relations on several issues, German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Ankara for hosting refugees from Syria and said the bloc should pull together another 3 billion euros to that end.

“We have promised 3 billion euros for the coming years in addition to the 3 billion that we have already committed. We need to deliver on this promise,” Merkel told reporters on arriving for the two-day EU leaders’ summit in Brussels.

“This money helps the refugees who are living under very difficult conditions. Once again, Turkey is doing a great job here,” she said.

Since 2015, the bloc has helped Greece, Italy and Bulgaria with nearly 2 billion euros to manage immigration flows. It spent another 100 million euros on controlling migratory routes in the Western Balkans, according to figures provided by the bloc.

It has been spending on more deportations and financing United Nations projects for refugees and migrants in Africa, and mulling a center in Libya to assess asylum requests there.

IMMIGRATION DECLINES

Despite criticism from rights groups that the EU is violating international humanitarian law by striving to curb immigration, the bloc has applauded itself for reducing arrivals by more than 70 percent in 2016 from the peak in 2015 when more than a million people entered in an uncontrolled flow.

The influx of immigrants in 2015 caught the bloc by surprise, alarmed the EU’s 500 million people and fueled support for anti-immigration, populist and nationalist groups.

The bloc’s asylum system broke down under the sheer numbers and the cherished Schengen zone of control-free travel was strained as member states introduced emergency border checks.

EU states have since sought to agree on how to change their asylum laws, with bitter disputes deepening east-west divides.

Tusk said on Thursday the 28 EU leaders would discuss the issue again in December and were aiming for an agreement by mid-2018.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament agreed its own stance on asylum reform, including an option to cut EU funds to states that refuse to host asylum-seekers reaching the bloc.

It proposed moving away from the current rule mandating that the first country through which a person enters the EU must handle his or her asylum request, saying it puts too much burden on frontline states like Italy, Greece, Malta or Spain.

Southern frontline states want a scheme that would automatically lift people off their soil during periods of exceptionally high immigration and take them elsewhere in the EU.

Westerners like Germany and Sweden, which eventually receive most of the refugees, have said more of the burden must be shared and that solidarity was needed.

Eastern EU countries like Poland and Hungary have refused to admit anyone, saying doing so could compromise national security and affect the traditional composition of their populations.",EU leaders seek greater reductions in Africa immigration,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CO2PY

LOME (Reuters) - Four people were killed in Togo on Wednesday in clashes between security forces and demonstrators calling for an end to a half century of Gnassingbe family rule, the security minister said.

Opposition activists have been demonstrating since August against Gnassingbe’s administration and say a constitutional reform he has proposed would allow him to rule the West African country until 2030.

Colonel Damehame Yark, the security and civil protection minister, told a news conference that one person was shot dead and around sixty others arrested in the capital, Lome. Another three died of gunshot wounds in the second-biggest city, Sokode.

“These are too many deaths. We’d be wise to preserve the peace,” he said.

The latest bout of protests followed the arrest in Sokode on Monday of a Muslim imam accused of urging his followers to murder soldiers.

Clashes erupted after the arrest. A crowd killed two soldiers and one other person died in unspecified circumstances, the government said in a statement. About 20 other people were injured, it added.

The deaths reignited a mass protest movement against President Faure Gnassingbe, who succeeded his late father Gnassingbe Eyadema in 2005.

The protesters are calling for his resignation.

“We deplore this toll and we say that backing down is out of the question. Despite what we have suffered, we will maintain our call for protests tomorrow,” said Brigitte Adjamagbo, one of the leaders of the opposition movement.

She said the coalition was aware of two people killed, including an 11-year-old child, as well as twenty others who were seriously injured and dozens of arrests.

In a bid to curb demonstrations, the government has banned marches and mass protests on weekdays.

But young protesters in Be, a working-class neighborhood in eastern Lome, defied the ban on Wednesday. They erected barricades with bricks and burning tyres and threw stones at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas.

“This is our last bastion,” shouted one demonstrator, Ayi Koffi. “We have no arms, no gas. We do not have cars to pick up people. We have come out barehanded to say, enough!”

In a statement, the International Organisation of La Francophonie, a group comprised mainly of French-speaking countries including Paris’s former colonies, said that nothing justified the violence.

“Dialogue must be prioritised in all circumstances,” it said.

The controversial constitutional reform will be decided by popular referendum after the bill failed to win approval from parliament following a boycott by opposition lawmakers last month.",Four killed in Togo as protesters clash with security forces,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1CO0Q7-OZATP

Verizon has struggled to fend off smaller rivals T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) in a mature market for wireless service.

AT&T Inc (T.N), its No. 2 competitor, plans to diversify its revenues with an $85.4-billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), a deal that, if approved by regulators, would give it ownership of premium content like HBO.

Verizon maintains it does not need to do a large content acquisition. “Just through licensing content, we can have access to content that we want to distribute to our customers,” Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said in an interview.

He said Verizon was continuing to work on a deal for content rights referenced by Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam at an investor conference in September but declined to comment on the type of content or partner.

Verizon said that it added 274,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis. Churn, or rate of defections for all customers paying a monthly bill, including tablet subscribers, was 0.97 percent.

Wells Fargo analysts had expected subscriber additions of 185,000 and churn of 1.05 percent. They said in an earlier note that the quarter was relatively less competitive, with consumers pushing out decisions to switch carriers until the fourth quarter when Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone X is expected to debut. New phone launches typically give customers incentive to upgrade plans and change service providers.

Verizon shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, rose 2.4 percent to $49.82.

Verizon also said it lost 18,000 video subscribers in the third quarter, citing a shift from traditional pay-TV packages to cheaper streaming services. Other companies have pointed to the trend, saying it contributed to a more competitive environment during the period.

Revenues in its Oath media business, which includes AOL and Yahoo, were $2 billion in the first full quarter to include both internet businesses.

Net income attributable to Verizon was $3.62 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, flat from the year earlier period.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets were flat on Thursday as a report on President Donald Trump’s possible selection to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed Wall Street to the plus side and sent U.S. Treasury yields lower.

After the market slowly pared its gains throughout the latter portion of trading, a report from Politico that Trump was leaning toward nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen to head the U.S. central bank lifted both the Dow and S&P 500 into positive territory.

The Nasdaq remained in the red, however, weighed down by a 2.4 percent decline in Apple (AAPL.O) to $155.98 on signs of poor demand for its iPhone 8.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove. At least that’s the interpretation of his experience in history, and therefore with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber accommodative monetary policy is more welcome than the alternative, which would be the market speculating on (Trump) selecting somebody more hawkish in nature.”

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.3178 percent, from 2.339 percent late on Wednesday.

The greenback also weakened after the report. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.24 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.54 percent to $1.1851.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 5.44 points, or 0.02 percent, to 23,163.04, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.84 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,605.07.

Traders were marking 30 years to the day since the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, although many market participants considered another such crash unlikely.

European shares notched their largest drop in two months on concerns over political upheaval in Spain and after disappointing results from large companies such as Unilever, France’s Publicis and Germany’s Kion.

Spain’s central government said it would suspend Catalonia’s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region’s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.60 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.02 percent.

Madrid's IBEX .IBEX ended down 0.7 percent, after dropping as much as 1 percent.

Data from China also put a damper on risk appetite, showing economic growth cooled slightly to 6.8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared with the second quarter’s 6.9 percent.

Other data showed China’s industrial output rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in September, while retail sales also outperformed.

But property sales fell for the first time in over two years. In addition, People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan spoke of the risks of a “Minsky moment” in the economy, referring to a sudden collapse in asset prices sparked by debt or currency pressures.

U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 1.4 percent at $51.29 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $57.23, down 1.6 percent on the day, pressured by larger-than-expected product inventories in the United States and some profit-taking after a recent run-up in oil benchmarks.","Stocks end flat, U.S. Treasury yields fall after Powell report",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-markets/stocks-end-flat-u-s-treasury-yields-fall-after-powell-report-idUKKBN1CO02R

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

”Hey Amazon, we need to talk,“ ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. ”We’re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Black people in Canada’s most populous province spent longer behind bars awaiting trial than white people charged with many of the same categories of crimes in each of the past five years, according to data obtained by Reuters.

Between April 2015 and April 2016, the most recent period in which data is available, black people awaiting trial in Ontario jails were there longer, on average, than white people charged with the same crime in 11 of 16 offense categories Reuters examined. There were approximately 6,000 black people and nearly 26,000 white people remanded to pre-trial detention during the period.

The data showed similar patterns in the four prior years. (Graphic: Racial disparities in pre-trial detention - tmsnrt.rs/2z18vS7)

Among the categories examined, black people spent almost twice as long in remand in 2015-2016 for weapons offenses, equivalent to an additional 38 days. They also spent 46 percent longer for serious violent offenses and 36 percent longer on charges of obstructing justice.

In three categories, white people awaiting trial were held longer in remand during the same period. Those included drug possession, theft and traffic offenses. In two categories, the difference was 1 percent or less.

The data also showed black people arrested and held in custody between 2011 and 2016 were more likely than white people to spend more than a year in pre-trial detention.

Reuters obtained the previously unreported data through access-to-information requests from Ontario, which asks inmates to indicate their race when they enter jail. Other provinces do not collect this data or categorize it differently.

A spokesman for Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said the province “takes systemic racism seriously and is working to address racial inequities,” but declined to comment on the data.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association, which represents the province’s prosecutors, and the Association of Justices of the Peace, which represents the people who decide most of Ontario’s bail cases, declined to comment.

More than a dozen defense lawyers as well as prosecutors, criminologists, and a judge interviewed by Reuters said shortcomings in Canada’s bail system appeared to play a role in the racial disparities shown in the data.

Unlike the United States, Canada virtually eliminated cash bail almost half a century ago. Instead, courts often require prisoners awaiting trial to secure a surety, meaning a relative or close friend who can appear in court and subsequently monitor them.

A surety needs assets to pledge, a crime-free record and, often, a home where the accused person can live until the case is complete. A surety cannot represent more than one defendant at a time.

Current and former prosecutors interviewed for this story said securing a surety can be onerous and the requirement is perhaps relied upon too often; but some said sureties remain the best way to protect the public and ensure defendants show up for trial.

HARDER ON THE POOR

Critics of the system say the poor are less likely than middle-class or wealthy people to have connections to provide the assets to pledge or housing to act as a surety. They add that this has an outsized impact on minorities, who are over-represented among Canada’s poor.

“Surety is a huge issue in Ontario,“ said Nicole Myers, a criminologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. ”If you are from a marginalized community or a criminalized community, it can be very difficult to find a surety the court deems appropriate.”

The data did not take into account specifics of each case, the person’s criminal record, the frequency of plea deals, whether the person had a bail hearing and why bail may have been denied.

Reuters focused on offenses with the largest pre-trial populations when comparing the average periods in remand, to minimize the impact of outliers. Inmates charged in multiple offense categories were counted in only the more serious one; multiple charges could affect someone’s chances of getting bail.

Studies, including one published last year by the Ottawa police, have found Ontario’s black communities are more heavily policed than white ones.

This makes black people more likely to be caught breaching bail and makes it harder to find a surety without a criminal record who is not serving as surety for someone else, said Chris Sewrattan, a defense lawyer who represents many young black men from eastern Toronto.

In a ruling this year, Canada’s Supreme Court called sureties “one of the most onerous forms of release,” not to be used unless other options have been considered, such as programs that assign a case worker and require the accused to check in regularly with the courts.

The court did not address race in its ruling.

LJUBLJANA/BELGRADE (Reuters) - In 2009, Serbian general Vladimir Lazarevic was convicted by a U.N. court of war crimes over the forced deportation of more than 700,000 ethnic Albanians during the 1989-99 Kosovo war.

The squat, bespectacled Lazarevic was one of the chief executors of a systematic effort to empty the then-Serbian province of ethnic Albanian civilians and raze their homes in the last bloody chapter in the collapse of Yugoslavia.

This week, two years after he was released from jail, the 68-year-old found a new job – lecturer to the next generation of Serbian soldiers at the country’s Military Academy.

Where a war crimes conviction might count as a minus in most countries, in Serbia it has become a badge of honour.

“The role models for the cadets should be Serbian generals, in particular those who have proven themselves in the toughest of times,” Defence Minister Aleksandar Vulin told the Vecernje Novosti newspaper on Wednesday, confirming the appointment.

The move has alarmed human rights activists in the Balkan country. But Lazarevic is not alone.

He is one of a trio of convicted Serbian war criminals who have risen to political prominence since serving out their sentences, testing trust in the country’s claim to have left behind its dark past and embraced Western democracy.

Civil society activists and Western diplomats are warning of the damage to Serbia’s image abroad and to the slow process of reconciliation in the region – a key condition of integration with the European Union. Accession talks with the EU opened at the end of 2015 and are not expected to end before 2022.

“The message is very dangerous; it’s playing with fire,” said Natasha Kandic, a prominent human rights lawyer in Serbia who has spent years documenting war crimes in Kosovo and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.

“This is not even historical revisionism, it’s the introduction of crime as a recommended act,” Kandic told Reuters. “It’s the end of any vision of European integration, good neighbourly relations, regional cooperation – none of that makes any sense after this.”

A spokeswoman for the EU’s foreign policy arm did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not obtain a phone number for Lazarevic, who rarely appears in the media. A spokeswoman said Vulin was not immediately available to comment.

“BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE”

Convicted war criminal Nikola Sainovic, a close ally of late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic during the Kosovo war, was appointed to the governing board of Serbia’s co-ruling Socialist Party within a week of being released in 2015.

Former army officer Veselin Sljivancanin, convicted in The Hague over the killing of more than 200 Croat prisoners of war at a pig farm in the Croatian town of Vukovar in 1991, is now a regular feature at events of the ruling Progressive Party of conservative President Aleksandar Vucic.

Lazarevic, Sainovic and Sljivancanin have always denied any wrongdoing.

While there is no law barring them from political roles, their prominence and the enthusiasm with which they have been embraced sit uneasily with the image Vucic has projected of a reformed former ultranationalist determined to take Serbia into the European mainstream.

Vucic, Serbia’s information minister during the Kosovo war, wowed European capitals this year with his choice of a lesbian technocrat as prime minister. The appointment of Vulin, a hardliner and former ally of Milosevic’s exiled widow, as defence minister in June was seen as a nod to nationalists and Serbian ally Russia, however.

Last week, Vulin told a gathering of army veterans that Serbia need no longer feel ashamed but “quietly proud” of officers such as Lazarevic, “the bravest of the brave.”

Afterward, Washington’s ambassador to Belgrade, Kyle Scott, took to Twitter. “Unfortunately, months of work on improving Serbia’s image in the US can be undermined with just one statement,” he wrote on Oct 11.

Kosovo, which declared independence with Western backing in 2008 but is not recognised by Serbia, said the appointment demonstrated that “Serbia has never changed.”

“We are deeply disturbed by the systematic glorification of war criminals in Serbia, and their rehabilitation in senior political, security, and education institutions,” Kosovo’s deputy prime minister, Enver Hoxhaj, told Reuters.

Kosovo’s prime minister, Ramush Haradinaj, is himself a veteran of the war, a former guerrilla fighter against Serbian forces who was twice tried and twice acquitted of war crimes by the U.N. court in The Hague.

But convicted war criminals have made it into public office in other parts of the former Yugoslavia: the mayor of the northern Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa, Fikret Abdic, is a notorious former warlord, while Johan Tarculovski, the only Macedonian to be convicted of war crimes in The Hague, is now a member of parliament.

The gradual “normalisation” of relations between Serbia and Kosovo is central to Serbia’s EU accession hopes, but the process has dragged on for years.

Hoxhaj lamented what he called “the silence of the international community on Serbia’s derailing from the alleged commitment to European values, democracy, rule of law and international justice.”",War criminal or role model?

But the leaders will make a gesture towards accelerating the process by launching their own preparations for a transition period that May has asked for and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after the dinner that she had “absolutely no doubts” that Britain and the EU could get a good result on Brexit.

In choreography that contrasted with images of May standing isolated in Brussels at previous summits, Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were filmed by television cameras engaging the British prime minister in an animated conversation.

In remarks delivered at the end of a dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May sought to calm fears that Britain will use its departure in March 2019 to undercut the bloc’s economy by lowering standards and taxes.

Instead, she asked them to respond in kind to her efforts to break the Brexit stalemate, making clear she was disappointed at their plan to announce on Friday that talks have not yet made enough progress to move on to a discussion of future trade ties.

May underlined the “difficult political background” she faces if she returns home empty-handed and said she had realized at the end of the summer what difficulties the talks were in.

“I took stock, listened to what the people in the UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forward,” she was quoted as saying by a British official, referring to a speech she made on Sept. 22.

She asked leaders to say, when delivering their verdict on talks so far, that “the clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward together”.

There was no discussion after she spoke, according to an EU diplomat. Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders, said only that the leaders took note of her comments. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters that she had made no new proposals.

Leaders will say, assuming no last-minute changes to a text agreed by their ministers, that they “welcome” advances made on some issues but that they were not enough.

DIFFICULT POLITICS

Weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority in a June election and by failing to rally support at an ill-fated party conference, May needs to keep the talks on the road to silence the voices calling for her to walk away from the negotiations.

The talks have stalled largely over how much money Britain owes when it leaves the bloc, with EU leaders urging May on Thursday to give more detail on how she will settle the bill.

May instead proposed more moves to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain - one of three issues the bloc says must be settled before moving to discuss a future trading relationship.

After May leaves the summit on Friday morning, the other 27 leaders are due to call on their staff to prepare for talks on the transition period.

That may be enough for May to stave off an attempt by several Brexit campaigners for her to walk away. May’s government has ruled out ending the talks, but the prime minister made clear to EU leaders that she “is working against a difficult political backdrop”, the government official said.

The official suggested she could not move beyond her offer on the financial settlement that she made in the Florence speech, but said she had referred then to several commitments.

“There is increasingly a sense that we must work together to get to an outcome we can stand behind and defend to our people,” she told the leaders, according to the official.

She spoke of a “framework that allows for a close economic partnership that sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance supporting prosperity for all our peoples”.

Talk of a shift in rights and obligations would please EU leaders, who have criticized Britain for trying to “have its cake and eat it”, retaining access to EU markets without having to follow its rules. They say that Britain will have fewer rights once it shakes off many of its obligations to the EU.

“We should be optimistic and ambitious about what we can achieve,” May said. “As we share the same set of fundamental beliefs in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights and high regulatory standards.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan N.V. is best known for producing EpiPen emergency allergy treatments and generic drugs.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process said on Thursday.

Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting “went well,” the source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list.

“I don’t think he’s leaning yet,” the source said.

Other contenders to lead the U.S. central bank are top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. [nL2N1MS2D8]

Powell, who is viewed as representing a continuation of Yellen’s gradualist approach to raising interest rates, along with Warsh, are seen as the top contenders.

Despite his time as Fed Governor under Chair Ben Bernanke, Warsh is seen as a less well-known nominee. He has criticized the Fed’s bond-buying program and advocated changes in its inflation target.

U.S. Treasury yields briefly renewed their drop late Thursday after Politico reported that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell for the job.

Trump leaves on Nov. 3 for a tour of Asia and is expected to announce his choice before that trip.

The president told reporters on Tuesday that he likes all five candidates. “I’ll make a decision over the next fairly short period of time,” Trump said.

Meanwhile, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Freedom Caucus mounted a campaign to kill any chance of a second term for Yellen, the latest sign conservative Republicans want a fresh face at the helm of the Fed, which sets U.S. monetary policy.

Representative Warren Davidson, a Republican on the House Financial Services Committee’s monetary policy panel, is among those who want a change. He is circulating a letter opposing Yellen’s reappointment, the Ohio congressman’s spokesman said.

“Davidson is very passionate about this process,” the spokesman said, adding that the lawmaker is particularly concerned about the impact Fed policy has had on the ability of small firms to raise operating funds.

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative Republican grouping in Congress, have been critical of Yellen, with some accusing her of keeping monetary policy too loose.

Key members of the House Financial Services Committee also have backed ideas proposed by contenders to replace Yellen. Taylor’s research, for example, figured prominently in a House-passed bill requiring the Fed to explain its actions through a strict set of rules.

The House, however, has no direct control over the appointment of a Fed chief. The Senate decides whether to confirm the president’s nominee.

Trump has criticized Yellen in the past and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington by naming new people to top jobs and embracing different ideas. But his economic agenda could benefit from the steady economic conditions fostered by Yellen’s Fed.

Cohn’s chances of getting the job were thought to have dimmed after he publicly criticized the president’s response to a white supremacist rally in Virginia.

But the top White House economic adviser, who is helping to lead the administration’s push for tax reform, has since gotten back into Trump’s good graces.","Trump concludes Fed chair interviews, could decide next week: source",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fed/trump-concludes-fed-chair-interviews-could-decide-next-week-source-idUSKBN1CO2LI

REUTERS/Mike Blake

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering tightening the vetting process for women and children seeking to enter the United States as refugees, a proposal that if adopted would bring security checks closer to those for adult men, three sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters.

The plan could slow down refugee admissions even after the end of a 120-day ban on most refugees instituted by the Trump administration while it reviews vetting procedures. The vetting review is set to end on Oct. 24.

President Donald Trump came into office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions, in line with the hard-line immigration policies that were a focal point of the Republican’s 2016 election campaign. Trump quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from some Middle Eastern and African countries that were challenged in court.

A U.S. official told reporters last month that the administration is “considering a wide range of potential measures and enhancements” to vetting.

Refugees currently undergo differing levels of security checks when applying for admission to the United States, depending on the perceived risk they might present, including running their biographic and biometric data against law enforcement and intelligence databases.

Women and young children go through a lower level of security screening than men, said the three sources with knowledge of the proposal, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The proposed changes would bring their security checks more in line with what is required for adult male refugees.

Successive Republican and Democratic administrations have focused most of their attention on adult men who tend to join militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State in greater numbers than women.

A State Department official declined to comment on any refugee vetting processes while the review is underway. The government is taking steps to “further intensify” refugee screening “to uphold the safety of the American people,” the official said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesman Dave Lapan declined to comment, and said the administration is “finalizing security enhancement recommendations as part of the 120-day review.”

A White House spokeswoman said there were “no announcements at this time.”

All refugees referred for resettlement in the United States are run through a database with watch-list information, called the Consular Lookout and Support System, or CLASS. Refugees can be singled out for a higher level of review based on their age, nationality, or gender. Syrian refugees, for instance, undergo extra checks.

Of the nearly 85,000 refugees admitted to the United States in the 2016 fiscal year, about 72 percent were women or children, according to the State Department. Total processing time for refugees to enter the United States now averages about 18 to 24 months, according to the State Department.

Trump’s order to halt refugee admissions so his administration could determine whether additional checks are necessary was suspended for months by federal judges. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually allowed it to go in effect for all refugees except those with close ties to the United States.

Trump also lowered the maximum number of refugees to be allowed into the United States in 2017 to 50,000 from the 110,000 originally set by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The 2018 level has been set at 45,000, the lowest number in decades.","Trump administration weighs tighter vetting for women, children refugees: sources",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-immigration-refugees/trump-administration-weighs-tighter-vetting-for-women-children-refugees-sources-idUKKBN1CO36J

Lo riferiscono alcune fonti vicine al dossier.

La società di recente ha sondato le banche per l‘operazione che dovrebbe avvenire già a giugno o luglio 2018 per consentire l‘uscita di uno degli azionisti, secondo le fonti.

SpringerNature è una joint venture controllata al 53% dall‘editore tedesco Holtzbrinck e per il resto dall‘operatore di private equity BC Partners.

E’ nata nel 2015 dalla fusione della divisione Macmillan Science and Education di Holtzbrinck con il business Springer di BC Partners, che pubblica libri e riviste scientifici, tecnici e medici. All‘epoca la società venne valutata più di 5 miliardi di euro incluso il debito.

BC Partners non ha voluto commentare, mentre Holtzbrinck non è stata raggiungibile per un commento nell‘immediato.

Secondo una delle fonti, Holtzbrinck potrebbe voler tenere la maggioranza dopo la quotazione.

SpringerNature, che pubblica circa 3.000 riviste scientifiche e circa 12.000 nuovi libri ogni anno, dovrebbe realizzare l‘anno prossimo un Ebitda di 480 milioni di euro e potrebbe essere valutata, secondo una fonte, fino a 6,5-7 miliardi incluso il debito per 3 miliardi.

Una simile valutazione corrisponde a 15-16 volte l‘Ebitda escludendo gli investimenti, ha aggiunto la fonte. Nel 2015 BC Partners ha detto che puntava a una quotazione del business entro due o tre anni.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the CIA said on Thursday a U.S.-Canadian couple kidnapped by Islamist militants in Afghanistan were held inside neighboring Pakistan for five years before being freed.

“We had a great outcome last week when we were able to get back four U.S. citizens who had been held for five years inside of Pakistan,” CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington.

Pompeo’s remarks appeared to be the first time a U.S. official has publicly stated that the couple and their children spent their captivity in Pakistan, contrary to accounts from Pakistani officials.

Pakistan’s military and government have indicated U.S. citizen Caitlan Coleman, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle and their children were rescued shortly after entering Pakistan from Afghanistan. The couple were kidnapped in 2012 while backpacking in Afghanistan and their children were born in captivity.

U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have previously said there was no indication the hostages had been in Afghanistan in the days before they were freed.

The officials said the United States believed the hostages were probably held by the Haqqani militant group in or near its headquarters in northwestern Pakistan the entire time.

Regarded as the most fearsome and effective Taliban ally, the Haqqani network gets support from elements of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan’s powerful military-run intelligence agency, U.S. officials say. Pakistan denies it.

A senior Pakistani security source said last Friday that Pakistani troops and intelligence agents, acting on a U.S. intelligence tip, zeroed in on a vehicle carrying the family as they were being moved into the Kurram tribal region near the town of Kohat, some 60 km (37 miles) inside Pakistan.

Pakistani officials bristle at U.S. claims Islamabad is not doing enough to tackle Islamist militants, particularly the Haqqanis.

After the release of the family, Pakistani officials emphasized the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington, which has threatened to cut military aid and take other punitive measures against Pakistan.

However, two Taliban sources with knowledge of the family’s captivity said they had been kept in Pakistan in recent years.

The Haqqani network operates on both sides of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border but senior militants have acknowledged they moved a major base of operations to the Kurram region.

As part of a strategy unveiled in August to end the war in Afghanistan, the Trump administration is demanding Pakistan cease providing what U.S. officials say is safe haven to militants, or face repercussions. Those measures could include further cuts in U.S. assistance and sanctions targeted at Pakistani officials with links to militant organizations.

‘VERY FRUSTRATED’

Pompeo’s remarks came ahead of a visit to Pakistan next week by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said on Wednesday the United States expected Pakistan “to take decisive action against terrorist groups.”

A senior Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday the United States considers the family’s rescue a “template for more cooperation” by Pakistan.

“We see this as a first step and we hope that we can build on it,” said the official, adding that Washington is “very frustrated that Taliban and Haqqani militants continue to find sanctuary in Pakistan.”

“It’s freedom of movement, it’s the ability to transport weapons and materiel, the ability to raise funds. This is what makes a sanctuary,” the official added.

Pompeo said the United States would do everything if could to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table in Afghanistan, but added it could not be achieved if the militants had safe havens.",CIA chief says U.S.-Canadian couple held for five years in Pakistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pakistan-hostages-cia/cia-chief-says-u-s-canadian-couple-held-for-five-years-in-pakistan-idINKBN1CO2LJ

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand firmed on Thursday, snapping a three-day losing streak, helped by some investors taking profits from the dollar’s recent rally and short covering triggered by the currency approaching technical support levels.

Stocks fell led by Harmony Gold which weakened after it said it may consider a rights issue to repay a loan.

At 1527 GMT the rand was 0.5 percent firmer at 13.5100 per dollar compared to Wednesday’s close of 13.5775 in New York.

A combination of a firmer dollar, higher-than-expected inflation print and negative sentiment spurred by recent cabinet changes had pushed the rand to its weakest in nearly a week towards short term technical support around the 13.60 mark.

Traders bearish on the local currency and betting on further weakens took the opportunity to “buy the dip” with a view of selling again at the next support level at 13.85.

The rand has been volatile in recent weeks, driven by fluctuation in market expectations of U.S. rate hikes and domestic political uncertainty.

Investec economist Annabel Bishop said investors appetite from riskier but high-yielding assets had cushioned the rand from further weakness.

“Emerging markets have seen strong foreign portfolio inflows in the current period of global risk-on,” Bishop wrote in a note. “This prevented the rand from seeing the additional weakness that would normally be warranted given the high level of political uncertainty.”

Traders are now looking ahead to the medium-term budget policy statement on Oct. 25.

Economists polled by Reuters expect Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to announce a revenue shortfall of 40 billion rand ($3 billion) due to poor tax receipts, likely pushing the budget deficit to 3.9 percent of GDP from 3.4 percent estimate.

In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 closed up 2.5 basis points at 8.795 percent.

On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index fell 0.43 percent to 51,526 points while the All-Share index lowered 0.44 percent to 57,897 points.

Among the biggest fallers, Harmony Gold was down 3.12 percent to 22.68 rand by close of day after dropping to more than two month lows early in the session after it said it might consider a rights issue of new stock to repay a loan it will use to finance the purchase of Anglo Gold Ashanti’s Moab Khotsong mine.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs start voting on Friday in parliamentary election tipped to hand power to Andrej Babis, a rich businessman turned politician pledging to sweep out traditional parties, boost investment and keep out refugees.

The central European country has enjoyed fast economic growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but opinion polls nevertheless show strong voter support for Babis’s ANO movement and other protest parties.

Although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a big part in the campaign, with nearly all parties pledging to fight any attempts by the EU to force the Czechs to accept refugees distributed across the bloc.

The anti-immigration feelings follow similar trends in neighbouring countries. Parties opposed to immigration scored highly in elections in Germany last month and Austria last week, and have fed scepticism toward Europe across the EU.

The ANO movement, set up and tightly controlled by Babis, has won support from both the right and left with pledges to cut taxes and replace corrupt politicians, as well as calls to seal Europe’s borders and not accept a single refugee in the country.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government together with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s center-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

The leader of ANO party Andrej Babis arrives for a live broadcast of a debate before the country's parliamentary election in Prague, Czech Republic October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Milan Kammermayer

Final surveys before a polling blackout since Tuesday gave ANO, which means “Yes” in Czech, about 25-27 percent support, although indicating a slightly declining trend.

The election outcome may be a coalition similar to the outgoing one with ANO at the helm, which would mean no big change in the country’s foreign policy of balancing close ties with Poland and Hungary with pragmatic relations with other EU partners like Germany, the main foreign investor and export market.

“I would not expect an earthquake. ..The most likely option is the three-strong coalition that has been there. These parties have not ruled out working with ANO,” said Martin Mejstrik, political scientist at Prague’s Charles University.

The prospects for a deal with ANO’s current partners or center-right parties may run up against their demands that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because he faces police charges of fraud in drawing a 2 million euro subsidy for a conference center a decade ago. He denies any wrongdoing.

There is an outside chance that Babis may form a minority government supported by the Communists and the far-right anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy Party (SPD) that jumped in final opinion polls.

Analysts see such a tie-up as unlikely. It would be negative for the markets and would pose questions over future policies toward the EU. Babis opposes adopting the euro any time soon but does not seek to leave the European Union.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets were flat on Thursday as a report on President Donald Trump’s possible selection to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed Wall Street to the plus side and sent U.S. Treasury yields lower.

After the market slowly pared its gains throughout the latter portion of trading, a report from Politico that Trump was leaning toward nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen to head the U.S. central bank lifted both the Dow and S&P 500 into positive territory.

The Nasdaq remained in the red, however, weighed down by a 2.4 percent decline in Apple (AAPL.O) to $155.98 on signs of poor demand for its iPhone 8.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove. At least that’s the interpretation of his experience in history, and therefore with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber accommodative monetary policy is more welcome than the alternative, which would be the market speculating on (Trump) selecting somebody more hawkish in nature.”

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.3178 percent, from 2.339 percent late on Wednesday.

The greenback also weakened after the report. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.24 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.54 percent to $1.1851.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 5.44 points, or 0.02 percent, to 23,163.04, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.84 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29 percent, to 6,605.07.

Traders were marking 30 years to the day since the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, although many market participants considered another such crash unlikely.

European shares notched their largest drop in two months on concerns over political upheaval in Spain and after disappointing results from large companies such as Unilever, France’s Publicis and Germany’s Kion.

Spain’s central government said it would suspend Catalonia’s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region’s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks.

Madrid's IBEX .IBEX ended down 0.7 percent, after dropping as much as 1 percent.

Data from China also put a damper on risk appetite, showing economic growth cooled slightly to 6.8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared with the second quarter’s 6.9 percent.

Other data showed China’s industrial output rose a stronger-than-expected 6.6 percent in September, while retail sales also outperformed.

But property sales fell for the first time in over two years. In addition, People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan spoke of the risks of a “Minsky moment” in the economy, referring to a sudden collapse in asset prices sparked by debt or currency pressures.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Everton’s miserable Europa League run continued as they lost 2-1 at home to Olympique Lyonnais on Thursday and remained bottom of their group as Arsenal beat 10-man Red Star Belgrade 1-0 thanks to an acrobatic late goal by Olivier Giroud.

Everton badly needed a win against Lyon after taking one point from their previous two games but they went behind in the sixth minute to a penalty by Nabil Fekir.

Ashley Williams headed them level in the 69th after being fortunate to only be yellow-carded for igniting a mass brawl when he shoved visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes.

Everton nearly went ahead when a Gilfi Sigurdsson free kick came off the far post but former Chelsea forward Bertrand Traore struck to restore Lyon’s lead, leaving Ronald Koeman’s side at the foot of Group E with one point from three games.

The Dutch coach is under pressure as his side have only won three games out of 12 in all competitions and are 16th in the Premier League standings.

“We always feel pressure, from ourselves and pressure from outside,” Everton defender Williams told reporters.

“It’s disappointing we didn’t get a result tonight because I felt we had a good attitude, and I thought we had a lot of chances.”

Serie A side Atalanta lead the group on seven points after beating Apollon Limassol.

Arsenal were given a fright in Belgrade when Richmond Boaqye hit the woodwork but they took advantage of Milan Rodic getting sent off in the 81st minute as Giroud leapt to scoop a cushioned header from Theo Walcott into the top corner, completing a sweeping move through the middle.

“It was a very difficult game amid high and heated intensity,” said Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger.

“The (home crowd) support was absolutely amazing, it was fantastic. Red Star are a massive club with a big history and the people here know their football.”

Embora a restrição esteja presente desde o início da operação do linhão, ela ainda não era considerada nos modelos computacionais que calculam o preço da energia --em alta pelas fracas chuvas em áreas de hidrelétricas-- e guiam o acionamento das termelétricas.

Mas a partir do próximo mês a questão será considerada, após a Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica (Aneel) avaliar que o problema é de “caráter estrutural”, limitando um alívio para os bolsos dos consumidores que poderia ocorrer com a chegada da temporada de chuvas nas hidrelétricas.

Os consumidores do país têm pago um adicional nas tarifas desde julho, devido a chuvas abaixo da média na região das hidrelétricas, principal fonte de geração do Brasil. Em outubro, a cobrança extra foi elevada para seu maior nível, a chamada bandeira tarifária segundo patamar, com custo de 3,50 reais a cada 100 kilowatts-hora.

Em novembro, quando geralmente começam chuvas na região das hidrelétricas, a expectativa era de que a cobrança extra caísse para 3 reais, primeiro patamar da bandeira vermelha, ou 2 reais, com bandeira amarela, mas a limitação de transmissão pode manter a tarifa sob pressão, disse à Reuters o presidente da comercializadora FDR Energia, Erik Azevedo.

“O que vai acontecer é que, com a capacidade reduzida da transmissão, vai reduzir a energia disponível no Sudeste... se não fosse essa restrição do linhão, a gente com certeza poderia ter bandeira vermelha nível 1. Com isso, já passa para bandeira vermelha nível 2”, disse.

Criadas para incentivar uma redução no consumo quando a oferta de energia no sistema é menor, as bandeiras tarifárias geram custos maiores quando saem da cor verde para a vermelha ou amarela.

A mudança de nível das bandeiras é guiada pelo custo das usinas termelétricas acionadas para atender à demanda, em complemento às usinas hídricas.

A bandeira vermelha nível 1 é acionada quando há uso de termelétricas com custo acima de 422 reais. O nível 2 da bandeira é acionado com o uso de térmicas acima de 610 reais.

Atualmente, as térmicas mais caras em funcionamento estão na casa dos 860 reais por megawatt-hora.

A comercializadora de energia Comerc previa que a usina térmica mais cara a ser acionada em novembro teria custo na casa dos 524 reais, mas com as restrições esse custo deve subir para quase 700 reais no Sudeste, o que caracterizaria a bandeira vermelha no segundo nível.

“Tem um aumento muito grande de preço, porque você não consegue escoar a energia pro Sudeste. Isso afeta, sim, o cenário de oferta”, disse a gerente de estudos setoriais da Comerc, Juliana Chade.

LINHÃO BUSCA SAÍDA

A restrição, que pode durar até o final de 2019 se o problema não for resolvido, tem origem em limitações em um equipamento chamado “eletrodo de terra” em um dos dois bipolos do linhão de transmissão que liga Rondônia ao Sudeste, operado pela IE Madeira, parceria entre Cteep e Eletrobras.

O eletrodo, que é utilizado apenas em casos de interrupção no funcionamento de um dos bipolos, precisará ser instalado em local diferente do inicialmente planejado para funcionar adequadamente.

O Operador Nacional do Sistema Elétrico (ONS) avaliou que, com as limitações no equipamento, falhas que obrigassem o desligamento forçado de qualquer um dos dois bipolos do linhão poderiam resultar em um blecaute de grande porte no Sul e Sudeste.

Para evitar esse risco, o ONS estabeleceu que os dois bipolos do linhão de 2,4 mil quilômetros de extensão deverão operar em capacidade máxima de 4,7 mil megawatts, ante uma capacidade total de 6,3 mil megawatts das estruturas.

Antes, previa-se que o linhão alcançaria uma capacidade de 5,6 mil megawatts ainda em 2016 e chegaria ao total de 6,3 mil megawatts em 2017.

As hidrelétricas de Jirau e Santo Antônio, entre as maiores do Brasil, somam cerca de 7,5 mil megawatts em capacidade de geração.

O diretor técnico da IE Madeira, Jairo Kalife, disse à Reuters que a empresa está em processo de conclusão de estudos e conversas com o órgão ambiental Ibama e com o Iphan afim de ter autorização para uma obra que solucionará o problema, com uma mudança no posicionamento do eletrodo de terra.

A intervenção deverá custar cerca de 50 milhões de reais. O investimento total da IE Madeira na construção de seu bipolo e subestações no linhão foi de mais de 3 bilhões de reais.

“Com uma complementação de entre quatro a seis meses a gente faz isso... a grande incógnita é quanto tempo vão demorar as liberações ambientais”, disse Kalife.

A IE Madeira tem sofrido um desconto de 10 por cento em sua receita desde a entrega do linhão, em 2014, devido à limitação do eletrodo de terra.

LONDON (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar after Arab countries imposed restrictions on trade with the tiny Gulf state and the company is looking at alternative shipping routes.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

For one, things got personal. Following an incendiary Sept. 19 speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” and threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, Kim wrote a personal letter, carried by Pyongyang’s main newspaper, calling Trump a “dotard,” among other things.

Insults and mudslinging have become part of the currency in U.S. domestic politics, but what works on the campaign trail won’t work with North Korea. There, the dignity and image of the leader is near-sacred and name-calling will be counterproductive. Elite politicking in Pyongyang is in no small part about competing to show loyalty to the supreme leader. Debate does take place at very senior levels, but only before Kim announces a position — never in contradiction to it. Any North Korean voices promoting a softer line will have been further hushed by the personal offense Kim has taken and by his forceful rhetorical pushback.

Second, the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in August and September. These have banned all North Korea’s major exports, including textiles, seafood and coal as well as joint ventures with foreign companies and new contracts hiring North Koreans as laborers abroad. China’s agreement to these measures was key and some degree of enforcement seems to be taking place.

This reinforces Pyongyang’s bunker mentality. The zero-sum game it sees with Washington is now compounded by China’s “betrayal” in supporting these sanctions. North Korea feels it is in a life-or-death struggle and cannot be seen to flinch at this, its most difficult strategic moment in the 21st century. Given the extreme level of state control over its citizens, North Korea is also well positioned to endure suffering and tolerate a severe economic contraction.

This brings us to Iran, where the political system is partially democratic and where sanctions did indeed contribute to voices of compromise in Tehran’s government. This led to negotiations and, finally, in 2015 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), usually referred to as the Iran nuclear deal.

The agreement is not perfect. After many years of talks, however, European and U.S. negotiators thought the deal was the best they could get. The deal does make it extremely difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s uranium stockpiles have been reduced by over 95 percent, its centrifuges by over 60 percent and its ability to enrich uranium has been capped far below the threshold for nuclear weapons. Inspections verify this at all points in the supply and production chains.

The agreement’s limitations include having expiration dates on these restrictions. It also does not include curbs on Tehran’s missile programs. But Trump’s refusal to re-certify Iran’s compliance last week seems largely because of Iran’s other moves in the Middle East, including support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Trump’s Oct. 13 speech has not killed the deal – at least not yet – but it does kick the ball over to Congress, which now has to determine whether to pull out or remain. It’s not clear what Congress will do but the deal will be in jeopardy if Congress decides to resurrect pre-deal sanctions or introduce new ones.

Crucially, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and all the other parties to the Iran agreement, including the European Union, Germany and U.N. Security Council members China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom say Iran is in compliance and that the deal should remain in place. In various statements they have all said the deal should continue to be adhered to.

Trump laid out a broader policy in which he wants to pressure U.S. allies into redoing the deal, while also trying to contain Iran’s other activities in the region more actively. But blowing up the deal would only further isolate Washington on the world stage.

This is important in terms of taking the high ground in the tensions with North Korea. Many countries in the international community, especially China, have been trying to coax North Korea back to negotiations, but they have been consistently rebuffed. Pyongyang officials argue that their country has a right to have nuclear weapons and that they are a necessity as deterrence against their old enemy.

On top of that, the North Korean authorities now can say: “See? Even if we come back to talks and make a deal with the United States, how can we trust them? Why would we ever give up our nuclear weapons for an agreement with this country?” To be fair, the regime already doesn’t trust the U.S. for its own reasons, but now it can justify it to the international community and make it harder for America’s allies to credibly argue against it.

Moreover, will China and Russia sign on to further U.N. Security Council resolutions against North Korea when the United States has shown itself to be so reticent to abide by complicated, negotiated solutions? These two countries may even lose patience with enforcing U.N. sanctions if they perceive the Trump administration to be only focused on pressure as a punitive measure rather than an attempt to find constructive solutions.

A negotiated solution to the North Korea crisis now seems well beyond the horizon. Trump’s jeopardizing of the Iran deal nudges it even further away. Until it comes into view, we all need to hope that neither side makes a mistake as they try to project toughness during this fraught period.",Commentary: Trump’s Iran decision hurts chance of a North Korea deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abrahamian-northkorea-commentary/commentary-trumps-iran-decision-hurts-chance-of-a-north-korea-deal-idUSKBN1CO2CY

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

“The cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,” said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

”Hey Amazon, we need to talk,“ ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. ”We’re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.

(Reuters) - Protesters shouted “Go home Nazis” as a white nationalist gave a speech on Thursday at the University of Florida, where hundreds of police set up barricades and separated supporters and demonstrators to guard against violence.

Richard Spencer’s event at the university in Gainesville, which prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency to prepare for possible conflict, came about two months after rallies by neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to a deadly clash with counter-protesters.

The violence on Aug. 12 added fuel to a national debate on race, and Republican President Donald Trump came under fire for blaming both sides for the melee.

White supremacists have been working to bring Spencer to various public universities, saying he has a constitutional right to free speech. The effort has forced college leaders to allow what they see as hate speech on campus and provide security to prevent violent clashes.

On Thursday, several hundred protesters shouting “We don’t want your Nazi hate” marched outside a campus performing arts center where Spencer spoke.

Two people were arrested, including a man hired as security for media for illegally carrying a firearm on campus, the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said. Another man wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with swastikas emerged from a crowd of protesters with a bloody lip.

“There were a few scuffles, but for the most part it was an extremely peaceful event,” said Chris Sims, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office.

Inside the venue, Spencer and protesters yelled at one another, and he criticized them for trying to suppress his speech.

“I’m not going home,” said Spencer, who heads the National Policy Institute, a nationalist think tank, and promoted the Charlottesville rally. “We are stronger than you and you all know it!”

He appeared to have few supporters in the crowd. About 15 white men, all dressed in white shirts and khaki pants, raised their hands when Spencer asked who identified with the alt-right, a loose grouping characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.

Spencer left the campus soon after the event ended, university public safety officials said on Twitter. Police worked to separate those who attended the event as they left the venue from protesters gathered nearby.

One Spencer supporter appeared to have been sprayed in the face with an irritant. Police were not immediately available to speak about the incident.

Anais Edwards, 26, was inside the venue and supported those trying to disrupt Spencer.

“I’m really proud of how our community came together. Many of them were willing to stand up and not let him speak,” Edwards said.

The university said it did not invite Spencer to speak, but was obligated by law to allow the event. The school said it would spend more than $500,000 on security, and the National Policy Institute is paying more than $10,000 to rent the facility and for security within the venue.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors U.S. hate groups, said Spencer is “a radical white separatist whose goal is the establishment of a white ethno-state in North America.”

An outspoken supporter of Trump during the 2016 campaign, Spencer rose from relative obscurity after widely circulated videos showed some Trump supporters giving Nazi-style salutes to Spencer during a gathering in Washington to celebrate the Republican candidate’s win. Trump condemned the meeting.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers voted on Thursday to bring online messaging and email services such as WhatsApp and Skype into the scope of tough telecoms privacy rules that will restrict how they can track users.

The vote in the European Parliament’s civil liberties committee was hailed as a step forward by privacy activists but heavily criticized by industry for being too restrictive and inconsistent with a separate data protection regulation.

Under the reworked “ePrivacy” proposal, telecoms operators and internet players will have to guarantee the confidentiality of the customers’ communications and ask for users’ consent before tracking them online to serve them personalized ads.

The rules aim to provide a level playing field between telecoms firms and online players such as WhatsApp, Google and Skype. Currently only telecoms companies are subject to the ePrivacy law.

MEPs strengthened the privacy protections in the original European Commission proposal by requiring web browsers to have their default settings as not allowing personalized online advertising based on browsing habits. Instead, users will be asked to opt in to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers.

Cookies are placed on web surfers’ computers and contain bits of information about the user, such as what other sites they have visited or where they are logging in from. They are widely used by companies to deliver targeted ads to users.

Websites will also be forbidden from preventing users from accessing their content if they do not consent to being tracked, a measure that was criticized by online advertisers as forcing websites to offer content for free.

“News and other online services rely on data-driven, ad-funded business models to finance the creation of content,” said Townsend Feehan, CEO of IAB Europe, the industry association of online advertisers.

“Content that must be given away for nothing will ultimately end up being worth nothing.”

Thursday’s deal is not final as the Parliament will need to find a compromise with member states, who are still divided on the issue.

Additionally, MEPs from the largest center-right group in the Brussels-based legislature voted against the proposal, saying it was weighted too heavily for privacy, restricting digital innovation.

However, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the vote in the parliamentary committee.

“Consumers should not be forced to give up their privacy when they visit a website, send an email or purchase something online,” said Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC.

“It’s alarming that the online companies who claim to be the trend-setters and the engine of the digital economy cling to an advertising business model based on snooping on people.”","EU lawmakers agree to strengthen privacy rules for WhatsApp, Skype",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-privacy/eu-lawmakers-agree-to-strengthen-privacy-rules-for-whatsapp-skype-idUSKBN1CO2OO

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs start voting on Friday in parliamentary election tipped to hand power to Andrej Babis, a rich businessman turned politician pledging to sweep out traditional parties, boost investment and keep out refugees.

The central European country has enjoyed fast economic growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union, but opinion polls nevertheless show strong voter support for Babis’s ANO movement and other protest parties.

Although immigration to the Czech Republic is virtually non-existent, fear of it has played a big part in the campaign, with nearly all parties pledging to fight any attempts by the EU to force the Czechs to accept refugees distributed across the bloc.

The anti-immigration feelings follow similar trends in neighbouring countries. Parties opposed to immigration scored highly in elections in Germany last month and Austria last week, and have fed scepticism toward Europe across the EU.

The ANO movement, set up and tightly controlled by Babis, has won support from both the right and left with pledges to cut taxes and replace corrupt politicians, as well as calls to seal Europe’s borders and not accept a single refugee in the country.

ANO has maintained its rhetoric of opposition to the ruling system despite serving in the outgoing government together with Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka’s center-left Social Democrats and the centrist Christian Democrats.

The leader of ANO party Andrej Babis arrives for a live broadcast of a debate before the country's parliamentary election in Prague, Czech Republic October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Milan Kammermayer

Final surveys before a polling blackout since Tuesday gave ANO, which means “Yes” in Czech, about 25-27 percent support, although indicating a slightly declining trend.

The election outcome may be a coalition similar to the outgoing one with ANO at the helm, which would mean no big change in the country’s foreign policy of balancing close ties with Poland and Hungary with pragmatic relations with other EU partners like Germany, the main foreign investor and export market.

“I would not expect an earthquake. ..The most likely option is the three-strong coalition that has been there. These parties have not ruled out working with ANO,” said Martin Mejstrik, political scientist at Prague’s Charles University.

The prospects for a deal with ANO’s current partners or center-right parties may run up against their demands that Babis personally stay out of the cabinet because he faces police charges of fraud in drawing a 2 million euro subsidy for a conference center a decade ago. He denies any wrongdoing.

There is an outside chance that Babis may form a minority government supported by the Communists and the far-right anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy Party (SPD) that jumped in final opinion polls.

Analysts see such a tie-up as unlikely. It would be negative for the markets and would pose questions over future policies toward the EU. Babis opposes adopting the euro any time soon but does not seek to leave the European Union.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - O ex-ministro Geddel Vieira Lima vai ser investigado no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) por suspeita de lavagem de dinheiro no inquérito referente à apreensão de 51 milhões de reais encontrados no mês passado em um imóvel em Salvador ligado ao peemedebista, segundo decisão do ministro da corte Edson Fachin divulgada nesta quinta-feira.

Fachin rejeitou pedido de Geddel para revogar a prisão preventiva decretada contra ele pela Justiça Federal de primeira instância. Ele recorreu ao STF para contestar a competência da Justiça de Brasília de ter decretado sua prisão, sob a alegação de que já haveria indícios de envolvimento do seu irmão, o deputado federal Lúcio Vieira Lima (PMDB-BA), no episódio.

“O investigado Geddel Quadros Vieira Lima manteve sob sua custódia, em imóvel de terceiro, mas localizado a menos de 1 km (um quilômetro) de sua residência (na qual se encontrava custodiado por determinação judicial), a já mencionada expressiva quantia em espécie, circunstância que indica, agora, a efetiva propensão à reiteração delitiva que, neste momento, só se afigura possível de ser repelida com a mais grave das medidas cautelares, como forma de garantia da ordem pública”, afirmou o ministro do STF.

Fachin decidiu decretar a prisão preventiva de Geddel, confirmando decisão anterior da Justiça de primeira instância.

O ministro do Supremo decidiu fatiar investigações que envolvem Geddel. Ele será investigado juntamente com o irmão e outros envolvidos no caso referente à maior apreensão em espécie no país e, na Justiça Federal de Brasília, por supostas irregularidades em operações na Caixa Econômica Federal, instituição da qual o ex-ministro foi um dos vice-presidentes.

Inicialmente, essas duas apurações faziam parte de um único inquérito. Fachin retirou o sigilo do inquérito referente aos 51 milhões de reais.

LÍDER DA ORGANIZAÇÃO CRIMINOSA

Em parecer encaminhado ao STF, a procuradora-geral da República, Raquel Dodge, defendeu a manutenção da prisão preventiva de Geddel, a quem chamou de “líder da organização criminosa” e que fez “muito em pouco tempo”.

“Em um primeiro momento, Geddel violou a ordem pública e pôs em risco a aplicação da lei ao embaraçar investigação de crimes praticados por organização criminosa. Num segundo momento, passados nem dois meses do primeiro, reiterou a prática ao ocultar mais de 50 milhões de reais de origem criminosa. Fez muito em pouco tempo”, disse Dodge, em manifestação.

AgCom sta valutando se imporre a Tim la separazione della rete, cioè il conferimento degli asset in una nuova società che sarà controllata al 100% da Tim.

“Stiamo parlando di un primo incontro, ma mi sembra che si possa aprire una fase nuova di relazione più costruttiva e più produttiva rispetto al passato”, ha aggiunto Calenda.

Lasciando il Mise, Genish si è limitato a dire che “è stato un incontro positivo e produttivo”.

Il ministro ha detto che si è “stabilito un metodo di lavoro insieme, che è importante. Invece di ogni volta avere un approccio oppositivo, come è stato in passato, per esempio sulle gare per le aree bianche, discutere prima dei problemi che si possono creare e cercare di risolverli con l‘obiettivo principale di avere una maggiore connettività”.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Dangote Cement is still interested in acquiring South African rival PPC and would do a deal at the right price, its outgoing chief executive officer Onne van der Weijde said on Thursday.

Weijde said PPC was a “good fit” for Dangote Cement, which is majority owned by Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote.

“We are still very much interested at the right price. We think it’s a good fit and we certainly would like to do a deal,” Weijde told an analysts call discussing its nine months earnings.

Dangote Cement made an approach to PPC last month, but later withdrew, saying it did not want to get into a lengthy process with an uncertain outcome, Weijde told the call, adding that the Nigerian company made an offer.

PPC is already the subject of an all-share merger bid by local rival AfriSam that values it at $700 million.

Earlier Dangote Cement announced that Weijde would step down at the end of the year as chief executive but remain on the board as a non-executive director.

Dangote Cement has invested $6.5 billion to develop cement plants across Africa.

Weijde said Africa required lots of cement plants to meet demand and that Dangote Cement was open to acquisitions or would grow organically as it had the know-how to develop new plants.

Shares in Dangote Cement, which have gained 26 percent this year, closed unchanged on Thursday at 219 naira.

On the call, chief finance officer Brian Egan said that Dangote Cement was considering a eurobond or local debt issue and that a decision would be made at the end of the year.

Egan said the company was leaning towards a eurobond with yields falling and the naira stabilising. He added that 70 percent of the company’s 389 billion naira debt was owed to Dangote Industries Limited, and it wanted to move away from that.

Weidje said Moodys had assigned a Ba3 local currency rating to Dangote Cement in preparation for the bond issue.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ annual ranking of the World’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies and power new markets and industries.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because the White House has not been forthcoming with details of an ambush in Niger that left four U.S. soldiers dead.

The attack earlier this month, which U.S. officials suspect was carried out by a local Islamic State affiliate, has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African country, which has about 800 U.S. troops.

“It may require a subpoena,” McCain said when asked what steps his committee might need to take to determine what happened to the four troops.

Questioned what information the committee still needed, McCain said: “Everything.”

Asked whether the White House had been forthcoming with the information needed by the committee, he added, “of course not.”

White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a Pentagon investigation is aimed at finding out what happened in Niger.

“An investigation doesn’t mean anything was wrong. An investigation doesn’t mean people’s heads are going to roll. The fact is, they need to find out what happened and why it happened,” he said during an appearance in the White House briefing room.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military’s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

Initially, the Pentagon announced that three soldiers had been killed in the ambush. The body of a fourth soldier, Sergeant La David T. Johnson, was recovered more than a day later and questions have been raised about why it took as long as it did.

“The U.S. military does not leave its troops behind and I would just ask that you not question the actions of the troops who were caught in the firefight and question whether or not they did everything they could in order to bring everyone out at once,” Mattis said before the start of a meeting with his Israeli counterpart.

McCain said he had had a good conversation with President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, and hoped the White House would eventually provide the information needed by the committee.

From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles.

The mission had been seen as a relatively lower-risk endeavor for America’s elite commandos and there was no armed air cover at the time that could carry out air strikes if necessary.

Mattis said contact was considered “unlikely” but did not provide further details.

“There’s a reason we have U.S. Army soldiers there and not the Peace Corps, because we carry guns. And so it’s a reality, it’s part of the danger that our troops face,” he said.

Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead.

U.S. officials have said French aircraft were overhead within 30 minutes.

Mattis said a contract aircraft evacuated the dead U.S. soldiers and Johnson’s body was found later by local nationals.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the soldiers were in the area to establish relations with local leaders and deemed it unlikely that they would meet resistance.",Senator McCain says subpoena may be required to get answers on Niger ambush,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-niger-usa-military/senator-mccain-says-subpoena-may-be-required-to-get-answers-on-niger-ambush-idUSKBN1CO2VE

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish officials said on Thursday thousands of their people had fled Kirkuk region fearing persecution since Iraqi armed forces retook it following a referendum on Kurdish independence that was rejected by Baghdad.

The officials said roughly 100,000 people had gone, though that number could not be confirmed independently, and many Kurdish neighborhoods in Kirkuk city appeared to be operating normally.

The United Nations voiced concern at reports that civilians, mainly Kurds, were being driven out of parts of northern Iraq retaken by Iraqi forces and their houses and businesses looted and destroyed, and urged Baghdad to stop any such abuses.

A mayor from the town of Khanaqin, Mohammed Mulla Hassan, said a Kurdish man was killed and six wounded by Iraqi security forces while protesting at the army’s takeover there.

Kurdish troops had left Khanaqin, near the border with Iran, on Tuesday to avoid clashing with advancing Iraqi forces.

Central government forces swept into Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic city of more than 1 million people and the hub of a major oil-producing area, largely unopposed on Monday after most Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew rather than fight.

Iraqi forces also took back control of Kirkuk oilfields, effectively halving the amount of output under the direct control of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in a serious blow to the Kurds’ independence quest.

Baghdad’s recovery of Kirkuk, situated just outside the KRG’s official boundaries on disputed land claimed by Kurds, ethnic Turkmen and Arabs, put the city’s Kurds in fear of attack by Shi‘ite Muslim paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, assisting government forces’ operations in the region.

Nawzad Hadi, governor of Erbil, the KRG capital, told reporters that around 18,000 families from Kirkuk and the town of Tuz Khurmato to the southeast had taken refuge in Erbil and Sulaimaniya, inside KRG territory. A Hadi aide told Reuters the total number of displaced people was about 100,000.

Hemin Hawrami, a top aide to KRG President Masoud Barzani, tweeted that people had fled “looting and sectarian oppression” inflicted by Popular Mobilisation militia.

U.N. relief officials said they had received allegations that 150 houses had been burned and 11 blown up in Tuz Khurmato and offices of Turkmen political parties in Kirkuk assaulted.

The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq issued a statement urging the Baghdad government “to take every action to halt any violations and ensure all civilians are protected and that the perpetrators of acts of violence, intimidation and forced displacement of civilians be brought to justice”.

Khanaqin, mainly populated by Kurds, also lies in a long contested territory just outside KRG boundaries.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Wednesday that security was being maintained in Kirkuk by local police backed by the elite Counter Terrorism Service, trained and equipped by the United States mainly to fight Islamic State militants. “All other armed group should not be allowed to stay,” Abadi said.

Sunni Muslim Kurds comprise the largest community in Kirkuk followed by Sunni and Shi‘ite Muslim Turkmen, Sunni Arabs and Christian Assyrians, according to the Iraqi Planning Ministry.

In another sign of rising tensions, Iraq’s Supreme Justice Council ordered the arrest of KRG Vice President Kosrat Rasul for allegedly saying Iraqi troops were “occupying forces” in Kirkuk.

Iran and Turkey joined the Baghdad government in condemning the Iraqi Kurds’ Sept. 25 referendum, worried it could worsen regional instability and conflict by spurring their own Kurdish populations to push for homelands. The Kurds’ long-time big power ally, the United States, also opposed the vote.

KURDISH LEADERS WELCOME ABADI OFFER OF TALKS

With the referendum having given Abadi a political opening to regain disputed territory and tilt the balance of power in his favor, the KRG cabinet on Thursday welcomed his call for talks to resolve the crisis.

Abadi had said on Tuesday he considered the referendum “a thing of the past”, and asked that the KRG cancel the outcome of the vote as a precondition for negotiations to begin.

In a statement, the KRG cabinet said, “It will not be possible to resolve the issues through military operations”.

It added: “(We have) asked the international community to help both sides start a dialogue to solve the outstanding issues based on the Iraqi constitution.”

KRG Peshmerga forces deployed into Kirkuk in 2014 when Iraqi government forces fell apart in the face of a lightning offensive by Islamic State insurgents, preventing the oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.

Iraqi armed forces also took control of Kurdish-held areas of Nineveh province north of Kirkuk, including the Mosul hydro-electric dam, after the Peshmerga pulled back.

Crude oil flows through the KRG pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan have been disrupted by a gap between incoming and outgoing personnel since Baghdad’s retaking of Kirkuk.

An Iraqi oil ministry official in Baghdad said on Thursday that Iraq would not be able to restore Kirkuk’s oil output to levels before Sunday because of missing equipment at two fields.

The official accused the Kurdish authorities previously in control of Kirkuk of removing equipment at the Bai Hasan and Avana oil fields, northwest of the city.

Kenny, now senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York, was a newly minted member of the New York Stock Exchange, having joined the exchange in February that year. He was stunned by the events that unfolded the previous day, the worst trading day in U.S. history.

“I don’t think anyone was prepared for what actually transpired in the overseas markets, which led to the bloodbath on Monday,” said Kenny.

When it was over, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI had lost 22.6 percent in one day, equivalent to a drop of about 5,200 points in the index today. The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index .SPX plunged 20.5 percent on Black Monday, equal to a drop of over 520 points today, and the Nasdaq dropped 11.4 percent, comparable to a drop of about 750 points.

In 1987 U.S. stock prices had climbed steadily all year, as they have in 2017, with each of the three major U.S. indexes hitting record highs in late August. But September turned into a difficult month, with each index falling more than 2.0 percent, though not by enough to raise alarm bells among investors.

But as the calendar flipped to October, the selling in U.S. equity markets intensified. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX fell more than 9.0 percent in the week before Black Monday.

On the morning of Monday, October 19, 1987, Art Hogan, then a floor broker at the Boston Stock Exchange, expected a possible rebound for stock prices. Nothing had prepared him for what was to unfold.

“It was clear in that first hour... this was going to be as bad as we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” said Hogan, now chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

Many describe the events of Black Monday as the first instance of computer trading gone haywire, caused by the use of portfolio insurance, a hedging strategy against market declines that involves selling short in stock index futures.

The prior week’s fall in U.S. stocks led to selling by investors in Asian markets to limit losses. Those losses then signaled investors in Europe to sell, which caused increased selling by the time U.S. markets were to open on Black Monday.

“It was like nobody wanted to question the computer,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York, who was a 26-year-old in his second year as a member of the NYSE.

“Then what happens is it feeds on itself because as the prices got worse the risk management software kept spitting out a new message - You need to sell more,” said Polcari.

Portfolio insurance, the short selling of stock index futures to protect against a decline in value, caused computerized program trading to issue sell orders as a safeguard against more losses. Instead, losses intensified, causing even more sell orders in a feedback loop.

With computer trading in its infancy, the floor of the NYSE was filled with more members than today, with trades executed by hand on paper. Thousands of traders scrambled to handle the tidal wave of selling, with volumes so extreme prices were delayed by hours, further complicating the process.

“The opening was 90 minutes (delayed), so you knew there was a lot of influx of orders, the futures (contracts) were down, everything was down, so we knew we were in for a rough ride,” said Peter Costa, president at Empire Executions Inc in New York, who has been working on the trading floor since 1981.

The widespread selling and delay in reporting prices also hit the stock options market, said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York who was trading options on the American Exchange at the time of the crash.

“The options market slowed down to a crawl because nobody could really figure out how to derive options prices from equities because we weren’t sure what the equity prices were,” said Charlop.

Of the 30 companies whose stocks are in the Dow today, slightly less than half were in the index at the time. American Express (AXP.N) lost 26.2 percent on Black Monday, Procter & Gamble (PG.N) plunged 27.8 percent, and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) tumbled 23.4 percent.

“The price movements in the stocks were not like anything I had ever seen prior to that day, or since that day, in fact,” said Ted Weisberg, floor trader with Seaport Securities in New York, who has been a member of the exchange since 1969.

“It was in fact the scariest day, the most emotional day, except when we came back to work after September 11, that I have ever spent on the trading floor.”","Thirty years ago this week, Wall Street slid into the abyss",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-crash-anniversary/thirty-years-ago-this-week-wall-street-slid-into-the-abyss-idUSKBN1CO0EL

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, a source familiar with the process said on Thursday.

Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting “went well,” the source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list.

“I don’t think he’s leaning yet,” the source said.

Other contenders to lead the U.S. central bank are top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. [nL2N1MS2D8]

Powell, who is viewed as representing a continuation of Yellen’s gradualist approach to raising interest rates, along with Warsh, are seen as the top contenders.

Despite his time as Fed Governor under Chair Ben Bernanke, Warsh is seen as a less well-known nominee. He has criticized the Fed’s bond-buying program and advocated changes in its inflation target.

U.S. Treasury yields briefly renewed their drop late Thursday after Politico reported that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell for the job.

Trump leaves on Nov. 3 for a tour of Asia and is expected to announce his choice before that trip.

The president told reporters on Tuesday that he likes all five candidates. “I’ll make a decision over the next fairly short period of time,” Trump said.

Meanwhile, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Freedom Caucus mounted a campaign to kill any chance of a second term for Yellen, the latest sign conservative Republicans want a fresh face at the helm of the Fed, which sets U.S. monetary policy.

Representative Warren Davidson, a Republican on the House Financial Services Committee’s monetary policy panel, is among those who want a change. He is circulating a letter opposing Yellen’s reappointment, the Ohio congressman’s spokesman said.

“Davidson is very passionate about this process,” the spokesman said, adding that the lawmaker is particularly concerned about the impact Fed policy has had on the ability of small firms to raise operating funds.

Members of the Freedom Caucus, the most conservative Republican grouping in Congress, have been critical of Yellen, with some accusing her of keeping monetary policy too loose.

Key members of the House Financial Services Committee also have backed ideas proposed by contenders to replace Yellen. Taylor’s research, for example, figured prominently in a House-passed bill requiring the Fed to explain its actions through a strict set of rules.

The House, however, has no direct control over the appointment of a Fed chief. The Senate decides whether to confirm the president’s nominee.

Trump has criticized Yellen in the past and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington by naming new people to top jobs and embracing different ideas. But his economic agenda could benefit from the steady economic conditions fostered by Yellen’s Fed.

Cohn’s chances of getting the job were thought to have dimmed after he publicly criticized the president’s response to a white supremacist rally in Virginia.

But the top White House economic adviser, who is helping to lead the administration’s push for tax reform, has since gotten back into Trump’s good graces.","Trump concludes Fed chair interviews, could decide next week: source",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-fed/trump-concludes-fed-chair-interviews-could-decide-next-week-source-idUKKBN1CO2LD?il=0

Elected officials are eager for the $5 billion-plus investment by Amazon and up to 50,000 new jobs that will come with “HQ2.” For its second campus, Amazon wants a metropolitan area of more than a million people with good education, mass transit and likely lower costs than its home base in Seattle.

Amazon has said it will announce a decision next year.

“There is no better place to do business than Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an Oct. 13 letter to Amazon’s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, seen by Reuters.

New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon locates in Newark and sticks to hiring commitments, according to a news release from the governor’s office earlier this week.

A report from the California governor’s office seen by Reuters said Amazon could claim some $300 million, and a bill in the state’s assembly introduced Thursday could offer Amazon $1 billion in tax breaks over the next decade.

And in a far different proposal, the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city would use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon. Bezos would be its mayor for life, Lary said.

Amazon’s need to compete for tech talent with Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) likely places the HQ2 prize out of reach for some smaller cities.

Moody’s Analytics Inc has ranked Austin, the headquarters of Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, as the favorite.

“The cities I talked (to) all know they are being taken and resent it,” said urban studies expert Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Martin Prosperity Institute. However, cities expect some indirect benefits from the contest, such as closer ties to state and regional officials, he said.

Since its beginnings as an online bookseller in 1994, Amazon has had a savvy approach to taxes, collecting no sales tax for many purchases until recent years, and now pitting governments against each other to win tax breaks.

In some cases, the contest has gotten heated.

New Hampshire warned Amazon not to choose nearby Boston, saying in a report posted online: “When you leave your tiny $4,000-a-month apartment only to sit in two hours of traffic trying to make your way to an overburdened airport, you’ll be wishing you were in New Hampshire.”

Milwaukee’s bid touted its proximity to Chicago, a nearby competitor, arguing that Amazon could tap that city’s workforce and amenities while avoiding its congestion and high costs of living.

“We consider Chicago one of our finest suburbs,” said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Many governments have declined to discuss the tax packages they are offering for fear of tipping off rivals.

The bid by Austin is confidential, a chamber of commerce official told Reuters. Missouri’s economic development department said the state had a non-disclosure agreement with Amazon.

St. Louis, Missouri received the most Twitter mentions related to HQ2 over the last two weeks - more than 1,300 - according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. Boston and Chicago were next.

Other candidates have simply taken the opportunity to market themselves.

”Hey Amazon, we need to talk,“ ran an ad for Little Rock, Arkansas in the Bezos-owned Washington Post on Thursday. ”We’re happy knowing that many great companies find our natural good looks coupled with our brains for business irresistible.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code headed for a pivotal moment on Thursday, with Senate Republicans poised to approve a budget measure that would help them pass tax legislation without Democratic support.

The Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for Republicans to meet their goal of enacting a tax bill and sending it to Trump for his signature by the end of this year.

“I think we have the votes for the budget, which will be phase one of our massive tax cuts - and reform,” Trump told reporters on Thursday.

The budget resolution contains a legislative tool called reconciliation, which would enable Republicans, who control the 100-seat Senate by a 52-48 margin, to move tax legislation through the Senate on a simple majority vote. Otherwise, tax reform would need 60 votes and would likely fail.

Although Republican Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, has threatened to oppose the budget resolution, Senate Republicans appeared to have enough support to approve it with at least 50 votes, along with a possible tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence.

After failing to approve Trump-backed legislation to overturn Obamacare, Senate Republicans are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform, beginning with the budget measure, which would allow tax legislation to add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade to pay for tax cuts.

If the budget measure passes, it will have to be reconciled with a markedly different resolution from the House of Representatives, which calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill. House Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks, setting the stage for introduction of a House tax bill by early November.

Republican success on reconciliation would all but rule out broad Democratic support for the Trump tax plan, which promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and individuals.

“There is still a chance to turn back from this budget and the one-party legislating that has stymied this Congress and been such folly,” Senate Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Democrat, said ahead of Thursday’s vote.

Trump sought the support of six Senate Democrats for his plan at a Wednesday meeting with Senate Finance Committee members from both parties. Five of the six Democrats, whom the White House described as open to working with Trump on taxes, are up for reelection next year in states that Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election.

The White House contends that the Republicans’ plan to slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.

But Senator Ron Wyden, the top Senate Finance Democrat, who attended the White House meeting, said he made clear to Trump that Democrats believe his plan would benefit the wealthy, raise taxes on some middle-class Americans and increase the federal deficit.

“There is a Grand Canyon-sized gap between the rhetoric surrounding this plan and reality,” Wyden told reporters.",Senate heads for vote crucial to Trump's tax reform plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/senate-heads-for-vote-crucial-to-trumps-tax-reform-plan-idUSKBN1CO0ET

Already mired in debt after years of recession, the U.S. territory faces storm-related damages that some estimates have pegged as high as $95 billion, and has asked the federal government to make exceptions to rules that typically require states and local governments to shoulder part of the cost of recovery.

Trump did not give any specifics about how much money the government may give or loan to the cash-strapped territory, home to 3.4 million U.S. citizens.

“I have given my blessing to Congress, and Congress is working with you and your representatives on coming up with a plan and a payment plan and how it’s all going to be funded. Because you are talking about some substantial numbers,” Trump said to Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello at the beginning of an Oval Office meeting.

Trump and some of his top aides suggested last week that there would be limits to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington. But on Thursday, the president’s remarks were broadly supportive.

The hurricane laid waste to the island’s power grid, destroying homes, roads and other vital infrastructure. The bankrupt territory is still struggling to provide basic services like running water. An oversight board charged with resolving Puerto Rico’s debt crisis has said the island’s government would run out of money by the end of the month without help.

Trump emphasized that repayment of federal loans and other storm-related debt owed by Puerto Rico would come before repayment of the island’s existing $72 billion in debt.

“Any money that’s put in by people - whether it’s public or private - they’re going to want to come in first position,” Trump said.

“We’re going to coming before - far before - any existing debt that’s on the island,” he said.

Trump declined to opine on whether the process would be easier if Puerto Rico were a state rather than a territory - a hot-button political issue on the island.

“You’ll get me into trouble with that question,” he told a reporter.

SENATE TO VOTE

While in Washington, Rossello also met with Senate leaders. The Senate is expected to vote in coming days on an aid package that includes $18.7 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has been helping Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands recover from three massive hurricanes.

Some senators would like to see more funds added to that package, Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told reporters.

Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida who has been deeply involved in discussions over the aid, said earlier on Thursday that he wants to tweak the bill so the island could more quickly access funds.

Congress is expected to consider another aid package by the end of December, but that could be too late for the island, which currently has no tax revenue, Rubio said.

“I know from experience the further away we get from these hurricanes, the less of a sense of urgency there is,” Rubio said.

Rossello has asked the federal government for approval to use disaster aid to cover a broad range of costs. He has also asked the White House and Congress for at least $4.6 billion in block grants and other types of funding.

“The reality is that we still need to do a lot more for the people of Puerto Rico and that’s why we’re meeting,” Rossello said.

Investors have been anxious to hear who President Donald Trump will pick as the nominee. A decision like Powell would likely be a continuation of the current stock market-friendly monetary policy that has helped fuel the market’s more than eight-year bull run.

Stocks had been recovering from early losses for much of the afternoon but the S&P 500 and Dow were still a tad lower just before the Powell report.

“Clearly at the end it had everything to do with the speculation about Jerome Powell,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “I can’t observe any other reason for why we ended up.”

“He’s viewed to be sort of an extension of (current Fed Chair) Janet Yellen by way of being a policy dove ... and, with the market loving more of the same with regard to uber-accommodative monetary policy, as more welcome than the alternative,” he said.

Powell was among several names circulating as possible picks, including Yellen. Others include Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economist John Taylor.

The White House on Wednesday said Trump will announce his decision on the matter in the “coming days.”

Tech shares were among the day’s biggest drags, led by Apple (AAPL.O), which fell 2.4 percent in its biggest daily percentage decline since Aug. 10 as doubts about its double 2017 iPhone release strategy weighed on investors.

Stocks have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

The day also marked the 30th anniversary of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Most traders see a repeat of the crash as unlikely because of modern trading technology and other changes.

SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was being pressured by the United States to prevent Russia from taking part in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

“We are seeing that the IOC is under strong pressure,” Putin said at a forum with scholars. “It relies on advertisers, television channels, sponsors, and so on. And these sponsors are receiving unambiguous signals from certain American institutions.”

Russia has been under intense scrutiny from global sports bodies since a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russian athletics.

Subsequent WADA reports found evidence of widespread doping and an institutional conspiracy to cover up Russian athletes’ positive doping tests at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.

The scandals are jeopardizing Russia’s participation at February’s Olympics in South Korea, which is dependent on the outcomes of a report addressing the manipulation of Russian athletes’ samples at the Sochi Games.

The IOC, which is now re-testing Russian athletes’ samples from Sochi, expects to make a decision by the end of the year.

Last month the heads of the world’s leading national anti-doping agencies (NADOs) called on the IOC to exclude Russia from Pyeongchang over the alleged state-sponsored doping, criticizing the ruling body for its leniency.

Russia escaped a blanket ban at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro although it was, and remains, barred from competing in international athletics events.

The country’s Paralympic Committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA are also still suspended over the doping scandals.

SOCHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin launched one of his most stinging critiques of U.S. foreign policy on Thursday, listing what he called some of the biggest betrayals in U.S.-Russia relations.

He declined to say if he would run for a fourth presidential term in an election set for March, though he is expected to stand after dominating Russian politics for 18 years.

Instead, he used a high-profile televised discussion with foreign academics in southern Russia to reach back to what he regards as the darkest days of U.S.-Russia relations.

Opinion polls suggest that harsh rhetoric towards the West plays well with many Russian voters, who credit Putin for restoring national pride and standing up to what they see as Western encroachment.

Asked by a Germany-based academic to identify what mistakes Moscow had made in its relations with the West, Putin told the Valdai discussion forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi:

“Our biggest mistake was that we trusted you too much. You interpreted our trust as weakness and you exploited that.”

Visibly angry at times, Putin cast Russia as the wronged party and its post-Soviet leadership as too naive and trusting.

“Unfortunately, our Western partners, having divided the USSR’s geopolitical legacy, were certain of their own incontestable righteousness having declared themselves the victors of the ‘Cold War,'” said Putin.

“They started to openly interfere in the sovereign affairs of countries and to export democracy in the same way as in their time the Soviet leadership tried to export the Socialist revolution to the whole world.”

Putin said U.S.-Russia relations were in a lamentable state, referencing an “unprecedented” anti-Russian campaign in the United States, the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities there and pressure on Russian media by U.S. authorities.

He did not single out U.S. President Donald Trump for personal criticism, but said Trump’s behavior was unpredictable as a result of political foes who were preventing him from fulfilling almost all of his policy pledges.

LITANY OF U.S. SLIGHTS

Putin said the United States was trying to squeeze Russia out of European energy markets with its latest batch of sanctions, which Trump grudgingly signed into law in August after Congress approved them.

“The recent sanctions package adopted by the U.S. Congress was openly designed to push Russia out of European energy markets and to force Europe to switch to more expensive liquefied natural gas from the United States, even though the volumes there are not yet sufficient,” he said.

He criticized Trump’s predecessors, describing how he believed the United States had betrayed Russia in the 1990s by not reciprocating what he called the unprecedented access Moscow gave Washington to Russia’s secret nuclear facilities.

He said the United States had flouted nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, saying Moscow had diligently complied with the same pacts only to be repeatedly let down by the United States.

His speech and ripostes in a punchy question and answer session that followed often sounded like a history lesson.

The United States had tried to stir up separatism in southern Russia in the 1990s, said Putin, something he said he knew for a fact from his stint leading the FSB spy agency.

The 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and NATO’s 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia were bad, he said.

And in comments that could have been drawn straight from the pages of the Cold War, Putin accused the United States of upsetting the strategic nuclear balance by modernizing its arsenal of weapons.

Russia would develop new weapons systems, he pledged, if it was forced to, and if the United States withdrew from a landmark arms control treaty -- the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- Russia would hit back fast.

“From our side, the response will be instant, and I want to warn, symmetrical,” said Putin.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on Thursday he will place his assets in a blind trust and divest all his stock in a publicly traded family business, amid opposition allegations that these holdings put him in a conflict of interest.

Questions about the assets of Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell, have dogged the minister and led some to question whether he would be forced to resign.

His plan to adopt a blind trust follow weeks of backlash over a government attempt to reform small business taxes, which have become a major stumbling block for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s two-year-old Liberal government.

Morneau said he had initially intended to put his assets in a blind trust - as Trudeau has - but had changed his mind after consultations with the ethics watchdog. He said he had “naively” believed that following the advice of the ethics commissioner was a high enough standard.

“What we’ve seen over the last week is that I need to do more. As minister of finance, in this role, it’s important to make sure people have absolute confidence,” he told a news conference, adding he has “about a million shares” in the company and would work with a trustee to divest his and his family’s holdings.

Shares of Morneau Shepell Inc fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday to C$20.63, shedding about C$21.6 million in market value.

Morneau was elected in 2015 when the left-leaning Liberals were vaulted to a surprise majority under Trudeau, becoming one of the many rookie ministers in Trudeau’s cabinet.

In a heated session of parliament after the news conference, opposition politicians said Morneau’s 2016 legislation on pension reform increased the profits of Morneau Shepell.

“The finance minister and his company, Morneau Shepell, have benefited from the minister’s actions,” said Conservative member of parliament Maxime Bernier.

Morneau said he had been pulled out of government meetings at least twice since becoming finance minister to guard against conflicts of interest between policy decisions and his company.

“I don’t know the total number of times, but I can remember at least two times being taken out of meetings because of that conflict-of-interest screen, I believe. Of course I don’t know what happened in those meetings,” he said.

Separately, Morneau said the government’s autumn fiscal update will be released on Oct. 24.","Canada finance minister says will adopt blind trust, divest assets",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CO2PA-OCATP

The defeat of ultra-nationalist parties in the Netherlands and in France earlier this year gave European leaders the sense that fear of a far-right surge had, after all, been misplaced. As it turns out, it was the relief that was misplaced.

Europe remains a battleground between nationalist forces, conventional right or left governments and parties which cleave to broadly liberal positions. It is not alone. Across the world, the same impulses to define a state according to ethnic or historic criteria, or to put existing states “first,” grow in diverse forms.

Two referenda illuminate the trend. One, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on Sept. 25, produced an almost 93 percent vote in favor of Kurdish independence, followed by an immediate demand from the Iraqi government to invalidate the vote and a threat to use the army to suppress any move to independence. On Sunday the citizens of the Catalonia region will vote on whether to secede from Spain – provided that the Spanish state, which has already arrested leaders of the referendum and confiscated voting materials, does not carry out threats to block all voting stations.

The tone in the democratic world is often set by the United States – no longer the champion of greater openness and cooperation, but now the promoter of America First. Work began earlier this week on prototypes for Donald Trump’s “beautiful” wall between Mexico and the United States; the president extended his travel ban to the citizens of three more states (Chad, North Korea and Venezuela) while dropping one, Somalia, from the list – this to align immigration “with his America First foreign policy vision.”

Europe, though, is the hub of nationalist struggles. In large part, this is because the nationalist politicians pit themselves against the continent’s large ambition to create a European Union which, in its enthusiasts’ view, should become a powerful, federal state through progressive integration – a perspective powerfully supported by the European Commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker in his “state of the Union” address earlier this month.

Immigration has been and remains the spur for the nationalists. Its growing unpopularity fills out their sails and brings them votes from all over the political compass, including a significant proportion from working class voters accustomed to voting left, even far left.

In Germany’s general election last weekend, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) soared to become the third-largest party in the Bundestag (parliament) behind the governing CDU/CSU center-right coalition and the center-left SPD, largely on strong opposition to immigration. One of the AfD leaders, Alexander Gauland, called Chancellor Angela Merkel’s opening of the borders to some one million migrants “a gift” to his party, which it gratefully accepted and used more successfully than even the party thought possible. Some commentators believe the shock to the German system – built for decades on a moderate consensus opposed to right-wing extremism of any kind – will “condemn Europe to permanent crisis.”

In Sweden, which has taken proportionately more migrants than any other European country over the past two years, crime, including shootings and riotous behavior, seems to have increased. The extent of that has been distorted by the right, but a careful analysis in the National Review does conclude that Sweden has “a growing problem with crime that is linked to immigration.”

The phenomenon was enough for the Migration Minister from neighboring Norway, Sylvi Listhaug – a member of the nationalist Progress Party, part of the governing coalition - to make a media-trailed visit to a Swedish “no-go area,” claiming during the visit that there are ""conditions of lawlessness and criminals in control"" in places with ""a large quantity of people with immigrant backgrounds."" The subtext was that this would not be permitted to happen in Norway. Her Swedish counterpart cancelled a scheduled meeting with her, saying her statement was “complete nonsense.""

In Central Europe, the Visegrad Group of states – the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia – have rejected requests from fellow members of the European Union to take in a quota of migrants. Earlier this week in Prague, I asked the leader of the ANO party, Andrej Babis, strongly favored to be prime minister after the October general election, what his policy toward the EU would be. He answered that he would demand a return of powers from Brussels to the national level, since the EU had no business dictating national policy – a popular view in the country. He has already made clear that he is wholly opposed to migrants being received in Europe.

In her speech on Brexit in Florence last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that the British had “never felt entirely comfortable” in the EU. It’s probably a fair summation of a national mood; most British have always seen the EU as a transactional, rather than political, union. When a sizable part of the population came to believe that the EU is both incomprehensible and overbearing, Brexit resulted.

Across the English Channel, Emmanuel Macron has put himself at the head of a revived and fiercely proactive campaign to rouse the EU to continue its forward march. In a speech Tuesday, the French president proclaimed that “the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic.” Integration – in defense, security and within the eurozone, had to be more profound, he said.

It was the vision in which one will not compromise with the nationalist forces – forces which will weaken Merkel, his strongest ally, as she tries to balance Germany’s contending forces rather than embrace his euro-optimism.

Brexit has had the headlines, and attracted the most derision from the EU enthusiasts. But nationalism – the wish to create, or to strengthen, the nation state against real or mythic enemies – remains a dominant current in the politics of the democratic countries.

“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June.
The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.
“I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.","ZUG, Switzerland/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Just three months ago, a tech project called Tezos raised $232 million online in a wildly successful “initial coin offering,” in which new digital currency is parceled out to buyers. At the time, it was the most money ever raised from the public in the white-hot cryptocurrency sector.

But the venture is now in danger of falling apart because of a battle for control playing out behind the scenes, Reuters has learned.

The acrimonious dispute pits Tezos’ two young founders – Arthur and Kathleen Breitman – against Johann Gevers, the president of a Swiss foundation the couple helped establish to handle the coin offering and promote and develop the Tezos computer network.

Under Swiss law, the foundation is supposed to be independent. It holds all of the funds raised, which have mushroomed to more than $400 million in value because the contributions were made in two cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – that have appreciated sharply. But the Breitmans, who still control the Tezos source code through a Delaware company, are seeking to oust the head of the foundation.

An attorney for the Breitmans sent a 46-page letter on Sunday to the two other members of the foundation’s three-person board, calling for Gevers’ prompt removal and seeking to give the couple a “substantial role” in a new structure that would limit the foundation’s responsibilities. The document accuses Gevers of “self-dealing, self-promotion and conflicts of interest.” According to Gevers, the two board members later suggested via email that he step aside for a month while they investigate.

Gevers told Reuters he is not stepping down. “As Arthur has done to others before me,” Gevers said, “this is attempted character assassination. It’s a long laundry list of misleading statements and outright lies.” He said the other two board members “are attempting an illegal coup.”

The Breitmans have been trying to control the foundation as if it were their own private entity, Gevers said, by bypassing the foundation’s legal structure and interfering with management and operations. This has resulted in costly delays in developing and launching the Tezos network and new currency, he said.

“They’re unnecessarily putting the project at risk,” he said.

In a written statement sent to Reuters, the Breitmans reiterated their accusations against Gevers and said they acted “in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.” They said their priority “remains the successful launch of the Tezos network.”

Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake: The Tezos digital coins, called “Tezzies,” are already priced at a hefty premium in futures trading even though they don’t yet exist. The launching of the Tezos network, which will trigger the coins’ release, has been delayed. Until the network launches – and no date is set – contributors to the fundraiser will receive nothing.

Under the terms of the Tezos coin offering, there’s no guarantee participants will ever receive a single Tez. Participants agreed to accept the risk that the project “may be abandoned.” Despite the feud, Gevers said he remains committed to resolving the feud so that “this project succeeds.”

The tale of how two young entrepreneurs raised a fortune for a project barely out of the starting blocks is reported here in detail for the first time. It highlights the risks inherent in the current frenzy for ICOs, in which tech startups issue new cryptocurrencies to raise capital.

Reuters reported last month that cryptocurrency exchanges – where virtual currencies are bought, sold and stored – have become magnets for fraud and deception. More than 980,000 bitcoins – the most popular virtual currency – have been stolen since 2011. Today they would be worth about $5 billion.

Similar large sums are pouring into initial coin offerings. From January through September, ICOs generated $2.2 billion, more than three times the amount invested in similar startups by traditional venture capital firms, according to Novum Insights, a data provider.

ICOs can be a way for technology projects to raise money online to finance the development of new, open-source computer networks that aren’t necessarily looking to make a profit. Contributors receive new digital coins, or tokens, which they typically need to “pay” to access the new networks.

But the recent flurry of ICOs raising millions of dollars has attracted some dubious business propositions and outright scams, as well as speculators looking to trade the coins for swift gains. Authorities in the United States, Switzerland, China, Singapore and other nations have begun scrutinizing the sector closely for potentially tougher regulation.

“Most ICOs are bought by people looking to ‘flip’ their tokens to a greater fool for a quick profit,” said Alistair Milne, a co-founder of the London-based Altana Digital Currency Fund, which so far has avoided ICOs. More than “90 percent will fall to have a near-zero value in time,” he predicted.

The new cryptocurrencies function through a technology called blockchain, essentially a public ledger maintained by a network of computers. Blockchain applications are being tested by financial services firms, food suppliers, retailers and other businesses as a way to make record-keeping simpler and cheaper. Tezos aims to be a blockchain that’s more reliable than the ones behind bitcoin and ether. Several entrepreneurs and investors in the blockchain industry said the Tezos technology has potential because it would be easier to upgrade and may be more secure than other blockchains.

ANARCHO-CAPITALISM

The son of Jean-Claude Deret, a French playwright and actor, Arthur Breitman studied applied mathematics, computer science and physics in France, before moving to the United States and studying financial mathematics at New York University. He went on to work for the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

He is still listed as a co-organizer and “dear leader” for the New York Anarcho-Capitalist Meetup in New York, which describes its philosophy as “a type of radical libertarianism that favors the abundant wealth production, rapid technological development, and high standards of living produced by capitalism.” Its website adds, “We are also fairly lazy about fighting the state.”

It was at a crypto-anarchist lunch in 2010 that Breitman first met Kathleen McCaffrey, an American college student from New Jersey. She is described on a political blog called The Politicizer as a libertarian Republican who first became interested in politics after listening to the provocative radio personality Rush Limbaugh at the age of five. She married Breitman in 2013.

Kathleen Breitman, now 27, later worked at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and at R3, a blockchain company. In a July post on the conservative website legalinsurrection.com, she said she “didn’t get along” at the hedge fund but had “a great time” at R3.

Bridgewater didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Arthur Breitman, 35, was an early fan of bitcoin, which first appeared around 2009. But he came to believe there were flaws in the blockchains behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, finding them hard to upgrade and not secure. He tried to come up with something better.

In the summer of 2014, while working at Morgan Stanley in quantitative finance, Breitman released two papers online that presented his concept for a new type of blockchain. He called it Tezos, a name his wife has said he coined after creating an algorithm that searched for the names of unclaimed websites pronounceable in English.

The papers were published under a pseudonym, “L. M Goodman,” but emails and messages from Arthur Breitman reviewed by Reuters make it clear he was the author.

In an email Breitman sent to an acquaintance in early 2015, he said he was seeking to create a business based on Tezos but was trying not to be associated publicly with the project at the time. He expressed worry that his activities might conflict with his employment at Morgan Stanley, messages show.

Reuters reviewed a copy of a “Tezos Business Plan” from early 2015, which listed Breitman as chief executive. The plan projected that if the company survived 15 years, it would be worth between $2 billion and $20 billion. The budget called for paying Breitman $212,180 in salary by year three. In August 2015, Breitman, who was still working at Morgan Stanley, set up a company in Delaware called Dynamic Ledger Solutions Inc, or DLS, to develop Tezos. He listed himself as chief executive.

The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requires registered securities professionals to provide prior written notice to their employer to conduct outside business activities if there is “reasonable expectation of compensation.” According to FINRA records, Breitman was registered and did not report any “other business activities.” Morgan Stanley and FINRA declined to comment.

“We made all the proper disclosures,” Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June. “It was a hobby, you know. And like there was never any intention to really commercialize any of the software.” She added: “We had some meetings with like C-suite executives at banks ... but honestly nothing serious.”

“A TERRIBLE SALESMAN”

In 2015, Arthur Breitman was pitching “Tezos Inc.” in the hope of creating a consortium of four to five banks to adopt the technology and fund the operation. The business plan reviewed by Reuters called for raising $5 million to $10 million over two to three years.

By then, blockchain was beginning to pique the interest of large financial institutions for its potential to help cut costs of cumbersome back-office processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities trades. Tezos’ 37-page business plan called it “an Internet for financial transactions” and said the technology could be used to automate the over-the-counter derivatives trading market.

But Breitman failed to attract backers. He told Reuters in June that he blamed his fundraising failures on the decision to develop the technology first, rather than just selling “a dream” as other blockchain startups were doing.

“I guess I was a terrible salesman as well,” he said.

In April 2016, Arthur left Morgan Stanley, and by that September, the Breitmans had started working on a new strategy for Tezos – to conduct an online fundraiser to distribute digital tokens, whose holders would maintain the Tezos blockchain. But the couple needed funds to keep the project going.

Over the next six months, they received $612,000 from 10 early backers, including several cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to the Tezos.com website.

To conduct the ICO, the Breitmans chose a complex structure. Earlier this year, they helped to create a foundation based in Zug, Switzerland – dubbed “Crypto Valley” because of its many blockchain startups – that is seeking not-for-profit status, emails show. The idea, according to documents on the Tezos website, was that the foundation would raise money via the ICO, then acquire DLS, the Breitman-controlled company that has been developing Tezos.

Working through a Swiss foundation, the Breitmans thought, would provide regulatory oversight but not too much. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June that she and her husband opted to use a foundation based in Zug because Switzerland has “a regulatory authority that had a sufficient amount of oversight but not like anything too crazy.”

Georg von Schnurbein, co-author of a book on Swiss foundation governance, expressed surprise over cryptocurrency ventures like Tezos setting up not-for-profit foundations in Switzerland. “For me, the public interest is not clear,” he said. While not illegal, he said, creating a foundation with the aim of allowing inventors to profit from a sale conflicted with its status as a not-for-profit, which is supposed to benefit the public. He said federal regulators eventually might prohibit it.

“The issue that there is some kind of for-profit entity and there are transfers right at the beginning is something that is working at the moment, but won’t be sustainable,” he said.

“EXAGGERATED, TO SAY THE LEAST”

As work continued for the ICO, which was originally scheduled to be held in May, the project started running out of cash, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters. She spoke with Tim Draper, the well-known founding partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm DFJ and a staunch bitcoin supporter. He invested $1.5 million through his firm, Draper Associates, which included taking a minority stake in DLS, the company that controls the Tezos source code.

The Breitmans had also hired Strange Brew Strategies, a U.S. communications company, to promote their project, and Reuters wrote a news story on May 5 about Draper’s involvement.

In pitching the story to Reuters, John O‘Brien, a principal of Strange Brew, had made claims about Tezos’ progress. He wrote: “The applications of Tezos, ranging from derivatives settlement to micro-insurance, are real and recognized by industry giants. Ernst & Young, Deloitte, LexiFi, etc. have adopted Tezos in their development environments and labs.”

On Oct. 3, a spokeswoman for the accounting firm Ernst & Young told Reuters: “The statement is not correct. EY has not adopted Tezos.” A spokesman for Deloitte said Tezos’ code is “one of many technologies we’re considering” with blockchain, but it’s “still early stage and we haven’t used the technology for a client project.”

Jean-Marc Eber, CEO of the French software company LexiFi, said, “The sentence, as stated, isn’t accurate and unfortunately exaggerated, to say the least.” While there had been “informal contacts,” he said, “at this stage, LexiFi has not adopted Tezos’ technology in its development environment or labs.”

Strange Brew declined to answer questions about the statement.

INVESTMENT OR DONATION?

The Tezos fundraiser began on July 1. The Breitmans had wide-ranging expectations about how much they might raise. A document on Tezos.com suggested that if they received more than $20 million, they might use it to “negotiate with a small nation-state” to adopt Tezzies, or acquire mainstream print and TV media outlets to promote the technology. In June, Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that about a year ago, when the price of bitcoin was lower, “we were like, ‘Hey, we would be lucky if we get 20 million.'”

When it ended after 13 days, the project received about 66,000 bitcoins and 361,000 ethers, worth about $232 million at the time. The hoard is now worth about twice that.

Kathleen Breitman told Reuters that participating in the Tezos fundraiser was like contributing to a public television station and receiving “a tote bag” in return. “That’s kind of the same thing here,” she said.

The fundraiser’s terms called the contributions “a non-refundable donation” and not a “speculative investment.”

If deemed a donation, and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of financial regulators in the United States. In the U.S., investments in assets such as company shares and other securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has been studying ICOs, and in July issued an investor bulletin that warned: “Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.”

Part of the SEC’s assessment is to examine the reasonable expectations of participants in the ICO. Some participants in the Tezos fundraiser told Reuters they viewed the coins at least partly as an investment.

Kevin Zhou, co-founder of the cryptocurrency trading fund Galois Capital, said he invested about five bitcoins in Tezos, which he considers overall one of the better ICOs.

“For me and for a lot of people this is an investment. We are looking for a return,” Zhou said. “I don’t really care about” using the Tezos technology, he added.

Draper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation. Asked this month how much he donated during the Tezos fundraiser, he replied via email, “You mean how much I bought? A lot.”

“TOTAL MENSCH”

At the moment, the Tezos Foundation holds all of the fundraising proceeds, while the Breitmans, through their Delaware company, control much of Tezos’ intellectual property. The plan is for the foundation to acquire the Breitmans’ company and release the technology under a free software license, according a “Transparency Memo” on the Tezos website.

Gevers, who founded the Tezos Foundation, said it has a contract that stipulates the Breitmans will either sell the Delaware company to the foundation “within a reasonable point of time” or, if they don‘t, “the foundation can take it.” He declined to provide a copy of the contract.

When the foundation will acquire the Breitmans’ company remains unclear. Kathleen Breitman told Reuters in June, “Essentially, you know, they’re going to buy out the company in like July or so, I guess.”

The Breitmans stand to receive millions of dollars if the deal goes through. According to the “Transparency Memo,” the new blockchain “must launch and operate successfully” for three months, then DLS’s shareholders – the Breitmans and Draper – are entitled to receive 8.5 percent of the fundraiser proceeds in cash. That amount, according to Gevers, is about $19.7 million. The shareholders also are slated to receive another 10 percent of the Tezzies issued, with the coin distribution spread out over four years. Those coins currently are worth about $140 million in futures trading.

Prior to the fundraiser, Kathleen Breitman effused about Gevers, 52, a Zug-based South African entrepreneur who has never before run a foundation. During an “Ask Me Anything” session in May on an online chat channel, she posted: “He’s awesome. Total mensch and very philosophically committed to our project.”

Relations later soured. The Breitmans objected to people the foundation suggested it wanted to hire, Gevers said. Another sticking point: The couple’s company hasn’t relinquished control over the foundation’s own website, www.tezos.ch.

“They control the foundation’s domains, websites and email servers, so the foundation has no control or confidentiality in its own communications,” Gevers said.

The Breitmans officially have no role at the Tezos Foundation. The letter from their lawyer this week proposed the creation of two foundation subsidiaries – Tezos AG and Tezos France SA – to develop and support Tezos, with the Breitmans serving as chief executive and chief technology officer of Tezos AG. The couple also would be given “observer status” on the foundation board. The foundation would then “limit” its activities to supervising and supporting the subsidiaries, “rather than conducting any direct operations.”

According to von Schnurbein, under Swiss law “the foundation is completely independent and the foundation board is completely independent.” Gevers said the foundation wants the couple to continue playing a leading advisory role. “They are both very competent people and obviously they started this whole thing. And it would be stupid to exclude them.”

But he added: “You can rest assured as long as I have anything to do with this, the foundation will be independent.”

Gevers said he has filed a complaint with Swiss regulators about the request he received via email this week from the foundation’s two other board members that he step down from the board for a month. A spokesman for Switzerland’s Federal Department of Home Affairs, which oversees the agency that supervises foundations, told Reuters that asking a board member to step aside must be done at a board meeting, not via email. The two board members who emailed Gevers didn’t respond to a request for comment.

As for the hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrencies raised in the ICO, Gevers said the foundation has slowly begun selling the virtual currencies – lately about $10.2 million worth a week – and plans to invest the proceeds in a diverse portfolio. The funds are intended to be used to run the foundation, ensure Tezos works and help to develop products using the technology.

So where are all the bitcoins and ethers raised in the ICO stored? That, Gevers said, was confidential.

“These are not held in any one place,” he said, “but secured through high-security” digital wallets “that no single party has control over.”",Special Report: Backroom battle imperils $230 million cryptocurrency venture,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-funding-tezos-specialreport/special-report-backroom-battle-imperils-230-million-cryptocurrency-venture-idUSKBN1CN35K

The Briton, whose paternal grandparents came from the Caribbean island of Grenada and whose mother is white, told reporters that winning the race was his priority.

“I don’t really have a position and I don’t have any plans,” said the Mercedes driver, who can secure his fourth world title at the weekend if results go his way, when asked whether he might ‘take a knee’.

“I know a lot of people in America so I get to speak a lot of black and white people who live here. I get quite a good view of what is happening here in the States and opinions from the Americans and about the movement which I think is pretty huge,” he added.

“I have posted about it because I respect it highly and I find the movement that started awesome. I am very much in support of it.”

Hamilton, who has a home in Colorado, has been active on social media in support of protests in the United States, posting on Instagram with the hashtag #takeaknee.

A small but growing number of National Football League (NFL) players have taken to kneeling during the anthem before games in protest at the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system.

More than half of all NFL players are black.

President Donald Trump has denounced those who kneel as unpatriotic and called for fans to boycott games if players persist.

Hamilton -- who has said previously that the issue is a global one even if the anthem is not his -- said his focus was standing on top of the podium.

“Winning here is the most important thing for me in the midst that all is going on in the country. That is a priority. You know what I am talking about,” he said.

Asked to clarify that, he said he was referring to an African-American reporter in the front row rather than all those in the room.

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (Reuters) - Big cash infusions for startups from an ever-expanding group of financiers, led by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, have extinguished hopes that the technology IPO market would bounce back this year.

These deep-pocketed financiers, which have traditionally invested in the public markets but are seeking better returns from private tech companies, have enabled startups to raise more money, stay private longer and spurn the regulatory hassles of an IPO even as they become larger than many public companies.

At The Wall Street Journal D.Live conference this week in Southern California, a number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, IPO experts and dealmakers spoke with Reuters about the surprisingly low number of IPOs and pointed to investors such as SoftBank for changing the business of startup financing.

“It’s not surprising if these companies get 10 term sheets,” said Nicole Quinn, an investing partner with Lightspeed Venture Partners, referring to formal offers of investment.

The result is a protracted IPO slump that has contributed to a 50 percent drop in the number of U.S. public companies over the last two decades, according to the Nasdaq. IPOs have fallen especially precipitously since 2014 - the year public market investors, including mutual funds, ramped up investment in private tech companies.

There are some signs of a more active fall for IPOs. Tech companies Switch (SWCH.N), MongoDB (MDB.O) and Roku (ROKU.O) have gone public in the past few weeks, with debuts from ForeScout and Zscaler ahead.

CORRECTION AHEAD?

Yet many investors are bracing for a market tumble after a sustained rally, raising questions about IPO opportunities for 2018.

Just 12 venture capital-backed tech companies went public in the United States in the first three quarters this year, compared to 27 for the same time period in 2014, according to IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital.

The drought continues even though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and Nasdaq Composite .IXIC are up more than 26 percent in the last year and market volatility is low, normally ideal conditions for an IPO.

Wall Street stock indexes have posted a string of record highs in recent weeks, and the Dow closed above 23,000 for the first time on Wednesday. [.N]

But Barry Diller, a longtime dealmaker and chairman of InterActiveCorp and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O), said the huge funding rounds had eliminated the traditional reason for an IPO.

“There is no reason to be public unless you need capital, and almost all these companies do not need capital,” Diller said.

SOFTBANK-UBER DEAL EYED

Increasingly, the big checks are coming from SoftBank, which in May closed a $93 billion investment fund.

So far this year, it has announced at least 14 investments in technology companies globally, including a $500 million deal with fintech company Social Finance and a $3 billion investment in shared workspace company WeWork, both private and already worth billions of dollars.

SoftBank is in the next week expected to finalize a highly anticipated deal with Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in which it, along with other investors, would purchase as much as $10 billion in Uber shares, most of them from employees and existing investors in a so-called secondary offering.

“This is the third liquidity option,” said Larry Albukerk, who runs secondary market firm EB Exchange and spoke to Reuters by phone. “It used to be IPO or acquisition.”

SoftBank’s deals are causing venture capitalists to “prepare for more M&A exits,” and fewer IPOs over the long term, said Jenny Lee, managing partner at GGV Capital.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s private market business, set up in 2014, facilitated more than $1 billion in secondary market transactions last year, according to Bruce Aust, vice chairman of Nasdaq.

Secondary transactions allow employees and investors to get some cash by selling to other private investors, removing a significant pressure to go public.

The flood of private capital, and the lofty valuations that have come with it, have, paradoxically, created another reason for avoiding an IPO, said Chris Clapp, a managing director with consulting group MorganFranklin.

“Many times with my clients I don’t think they would achieve the same valuation in the public markets,” Clapp said in a phone interview.

Meal delivery company Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) took a 27 percent haircut when it went public in June and software company Cloudera Inc (CLDR.N) lost 53 percent of its valuation in its April IPO.

Snap Inc (SNAP.N), the owner of messaging app Snapchat, is down more than 10 percent from its IPO price in March.",SoftBank's big checks are stalling tech IPOs,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CO3BX-OCABS

Barring a surprise and despite May’s plea over a summit dinner in Brussels late on Thursday, the EU will reject British demands for an immediate opening of post-Brexit trade negotiations on Friday and will instead set a target of December for London to improve its offer on a divorce settlement.

But the leaders will make a gesture towards accelerating the process by launching their own preparations for a transition period that May has asked for and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after the dinner that she had “absolutely no doubts” that Britain and the EU could get a good result on Brexit.

In choreography that contrasted with images of May standing isolated in Brussels at previous summits, Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron were filmed by television cameras engaging the British prime minister in an animated conversation.

In remarks delivered at the end of a dinner of butternut gnocchi and pheasant supreme, May sought to calm fears that Britain will use its departure in March 2019 to undercut the bloc’s economy by lowering standards and taxes.

Instead, she asked them to respond in kind to her efforts to break the Brexit stalemate, making clear she was disappointed at their plan to announce on Friday that talks have not yet made enough progress to move on to a discussion of future trade ties.

May underlined the “difficult political background” she faces if she returns home empty-handed and said she had realized at the end of the summer what difficulties the talks were in.

“I took stock, listened to what the people in the UK were saying and what my friends and partners in Europe were saying and I made a step forward,” she was quoted as saying by a British official, referring to a speech she made on Sept. 22.

She asked leaders to say, when delivering their verdict on talks so far, that “the clear and urgent imperative must be that the dynamic you create enables us to move forward together”.

There was no discussion after she spoke, according to an EU diplomat. Donald Tusk, the chairman of EU leaders, said only that the leaders took note of her comments. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters that she had made no new proposals.

Leaders will say, assuming no last-minute changes to a text agreed by their ministers, that they “welcome” advances made on some issues but that they were not enough.

DIFFICULT POLITICS

Weakened after losing her Conservatives’ majority in a June election and by failing to rally support at an ill-fated party conference, May needs to keep the talks on the road to silence the voices calling for her to walk away from the negotiations.

The talks have stalled largely over how much money Britain owes when it leaves the bloc, with EU leaders urging May on Thursday to give more detail on how she will settle the bill.

May instead proposed more moves to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain - one of three issues the bloc says must be settled before moving to discuss a future trading relationship.

After May leaves the summit on Friday morning, the other 27 leaders are due to call on their staff to prepare for talks on the transition period.

That may be enough for May to stave off an attempt by several Brexit campaigners for her to walk away. May’s government has ruled out ending the talks, but the prime minister made clear to EU leaders that she “is working against a difficult political backdrop”, the government official said.

The official suggested she could not move beyond her offer on the financial settlement that she made in the Florence speech, but said she had referred then to several commitments.

“There is increasingly a sense that we must work together to get to an outcome we can stand behind and defend to our people,” she told the leaders, according to the official.

She spoke of a “framework that allows for a close economic partnership that sets rights and obligations in a new and different balance supporting prosperity for all our peoples”.

Talk of a shift in rights and obligations would please EU leaders, who have criticized Britain for trying to “have its cake and eat it”, retaining access to EU markets without having to follow its rules. They say that Britain will have fewer rights once it shakes off many of its obligations to the EU.

“We should be optimistic and ambitious about what we can achieve,” May said. “As we share the same set of fundamental beliefs in free trade, rigorous and fair competition, strong consumer rights and high regulatory standards.”
