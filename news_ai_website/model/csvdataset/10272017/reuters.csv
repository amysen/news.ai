Mining companies, including Newmont Mining Corp, Teck Resources and Barrick Gold Corp, reported increased costs this week in their quarterly earnings, lifted by factors including supplier inflation, firmer currencies and renewed exploration and development spending.

Having just emerged from five years of belt-tightening when metal prices were weak, mining companies want to ensure that the benefits gained from that painful exercise are not lost.

Big miners said this week that they will flex their muscle with suppliers, who sell materials ranging from chemicals and trucks to steel.

“We’re going to be exercising all our purchasing power strength to drive those prices down,” Barrick’s Chief Operating Officer Richard Williams said on a conference call on Thursday, without specifying which suppliers were hiking prices.

Encouraged by a rebound in prices for gold, copper and other metals that picked up steam late last year, miners are once again opening their wallets to spend on exploration and mine development, increasing competition for goods and services, and pushing up those input prices.

Gold prices have climbed 11.5 percent, to $1,272.80 an ounce from $1,141.19 in mid-December 2016, while copper has soared 54 percent, to $3.23 a pound from $2.10 in late October 2016.

Since miners sell commodities, whose prices are fixed by the market, they cannot immediately pass on the costs to the end customers.

But suppliers like Caterpillar Inc, the world’s biggest maker of mining equipment, are reaping the rewards. The company, which this week reported earnings that blew past analyst estimates, expects mining revenue to jump 30 percent this year.

THE BIG FIVE

The production costs of four of the world’s five biggest gold miners by market value - Newmont, Barrick, Newcrest Mining Ltd and Goldcorp Inc - rose by an average 7 percent in the third-quarter compared with a year ago, results this week showed. The fifth, China’s Zijin Mining Group, did not provide comparable cost figures.

When “you go from a period of very low levels of activity with vendors to an increased level, there’s going to be a price impact,” said Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan Inc, the world’s No. 2 copper miner by market value, on a conference call Wednesday.

Like Barrick, Freeport’s size gives it bargaining clout with suppliers, Adkerson said, which should help keep goods and services prices in check.

Stronger currencies in Canada and Australia over the past six months are also lifting costs, such as labor - the sector’s biggest minesite input cost, and squeezing margins for companies because sales of commodities are priced in U.S. dollars.

Since May, the Canadian dollar has strengthened by 7 percent and the Australian dollar by 4 percent.

While miners are starting to spend again on exploration and development, analysts expect them to be more cautious than in the 2008-2012 boom, when costs spiraled out of control on several multi-billion dollar projects, including Barrick’s Pascua-Lama venture in South America.

“The lack of focus on costs during the last super cycle is still fresh in the minds of mining companies,” said Anton Ivanyi, consulting firm EY’s British Columbia mining and metals sector leader.

Security Minister Ben Wallace said Britain believed “quite strongly” that the ransomware attack came from a foreign state.

""North Korea was the state that we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems,"" he told BBC radio.

“We can be as sure as possible - I can’t obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role.”

WannaCry infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries in a matter of days, demanding victims pay ransoms starting at $300 to regain access to their machines.

Cyber security researchers quickly identified a possible link to North Korea.

More than a third of England’s 236 NHS trusts and an estimated 19,000 appointments were affected, Britain’s National Audit Office said on Friday in a report on the attack.

It said WannaCry was a relatively unsophisticated attack that could have been prevented by the NHS had it followed basic IT security best practice.

No NHS organization paid the ransom but the government does not know how much the disruption to services cost the NHS, it said.

Wallace said Britain needed to redouble its efforts to strengthen cyber security.

“Mexico could be the next step ... a 30-40 percent dilution is something that could be achieved,” finance chief Massimo Mondazzi said in a conference call for third-quarter results.

Under its so-called “dual exploration” strategy, Eni aims to sell down stakes in fields it operates to raise cash to fund future development and support dividends.

The state-controlled company, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa, was the first major to cut its dividend in 2015 after a steep fall in oil prices.

Eni expects to cash in 3.7 billion euros this year in disposals after completing the sale of a stake in Mozambique to Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) by the end of the year.

“Indonesia could be the next target (for a sell down),” Mondazzi told analysts.

Eni, the world’s most successful explorer in recent years after finding two super-giant fields in Egypt and Mozambique, owns oil fields in Mexico which it considers the next frontier.

It is operator in two big fields in Indonesia, including 55 percent-owned Jangkrik which it says will produce 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

This year it sold 30 percent of its Shorouk concession in Egypt to Rosneft (ROSN.MM) for $1.1 billion and agreed to sell 25 percent of Mozambique’s Area 4 to Exxon for $2.8 billion.

“We want to maintain operatorship (in Mexico and Indonesia),” Mondazzi added.

The group originally planned to sell its retail gas and power division as well as its chemical unit Versalis but has since decided to hang on to them.

“An IPO of Versalis is not on the table,” Mondazzi said.

Earlier on Friday, Eni confirmed its production would grow by 5 percent this year to 1.84 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d), while investments would fall 18 percent.

Production in the third quarter rose 5 percent to 1.8 mboe/d, lifted in part by the restart of fields in Libya.

The group said it expected output to rise to 1.9 mboe/d in the final quarter despite a delay in ramp-up at its giant Kashagan field to next year.

Adjusted net profit in the quarter reached 229 million euros ($267 million), compared with an adjusted loss of 484 million last year, Eni said. That was below an analyst consensus provided by the company of 350 million.

Adjusted operating cash flow was 1.72 billion euros against 2.28 billion in the second quarter.

“In 2017 we expect to achieve organic coverage of investments and dividends, entirely paid in cash, at a Brent price of $60 a barrel,” CEO Claudio Descalzi said in a statement.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the July-September period, also supported by strong business spending on equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. With inventories, goods yet to be sold, contributing almost three-quarters of a percentage point to growth last quarter, the increase in GDP overstates the economy’s health.

Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarter’s 2.9 percent pace. A measure of domestic demand also decelerated to a 2.2 percent growth rate from the April-June period’s 3.3 percent pace.

“This is a positive report for an economy that was battered by two hurricanes late in the quarter but it is not as strong as the headline 3.0 percent growth might suggest,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter. It was the first time since 2014 that it experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two quarters in a row. Economists had forecast GDP increasing at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter.

The government said while it was impossible to estimate the overall impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on third-quarter GDP, preliminary estimates showed that the back-to-back storms had caused losses of $121.0 billion in privately owned fixed assets and $10.4 billion in government-owned fixed assets.

Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, had no impact on third-quarter GDP growth as the islands are not included in the United States’ national accounts.

Post-hurricane labor market, retail sales and industrial production data already show an acceleration in underlying economic activity. Economists expect the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates for a third time this year in December.

“Fed officials will be encouraged by both the overall performance and the composition of growth in the third quarter, which confirms the U.S. economic expansion remains on solid ground,” said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

The dollar rose to a three-month high against a basket of currencies on the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest rate sensitive two-year note touching a fresh nine-year high. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.

The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue. The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term.

Though U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax reform, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies. Trump wants big tax cuts and fewer regulations to boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent.

INVENTORY BOOST

Businesses accumulated inventories at a $35.8 billion pace in the third quarter, leading to inventory investment adding 0.73 percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth. Inventories contributed just over a tenth of a percentage point to output in the prior period. Economists expect a modest boost from inventories in the fourth quarter.

Though export growth slowed in the last quarter, that was eclipsed by the steepest pace of decline in imports in three years, leaving a smaller trade deficit, which added four-tenths of a percentage point to GDP growth. Trade has contributed to output for three quarters in a row.

Business investment in equipment rose at an 8.6 percent rate, increasing for a fourth straight quarter. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, slowed to a 2.4 percent rate as hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt incomes.

Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter and is likely to accelerate in the fourth quarter with a separate report on Friday showing consumer sentiment holding at lofty levels in October.

Despite the moderation in consumer spending, inflation perked up in the third quarter, likely as a result of disruptions to the supply chain caused by the hurricanes.

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.3 percent rate. That followed a 0.9 percent pace of increase in the second quarter.

With inflation rising, income at the disposal of households increased at a 0.6 percent rate, braking sharply from the second-quarter’s strong 3.3 percent pace.

Investment in nonresidential structures fell at a 5.2 percent pace in the third quarter, the biggest drop in nearly two years, as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at only a 21.7 percent rate, a sharp deceleration from the second-quarter’s 116.3 percent pace.

Investment in homebuilding, which was already undermined by land and labor shortages, contracted for a second consecutive quarter. Government investment recorded its third straight quarterly decline

“While hurricane effects are hard to parse out of the GDP data, we anticipate rebuilding efforts will lift residential investment out of the doldrums it has occupied the last two quarters,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.","Inventories, trade shield U.S. economy from hurricane headwinds",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/inventories-trade-shield-u-s-economy-from-hurricane-headwinds-idUKKBN1CW0ER

Repeated delays to the poll, originally scheduled for late 2016, have led to unrest and raised fears the Central African nation could slip back to the wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley, who met with the Congolese electoral commission (CENI) during a visit to Kinshasa, told reporters she had passed on a message that “these elections must take place in 2018 or there will be no support for the electoral process”.

“The president must say that we’re going to have elections in 2018,” Haley said ahead of a later meeting with Kabila. “Every day we don’t have elections in this country someone dies.”

The electoral commission had said earlier this month that the vote to replace Kabila could not take place until April 2019 at the earliest, leading the opposition to warn that the population would “take matters into its own hands”.

Dozens died in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. The resulting political crisis has also contributed to rising militia violence in Congo’s east and center.

Kabila, who has ruled Congo since his father’s assassination in 2001, says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters.

However, his opponents accuse him of using the delay to maneuver to remove term limits that prevent him from standing for re-election, as presidents in neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done. He denies those charges.

“Bittersüß”, sei ihm zumute, sagte David McCaleb am Freitag in einem Reuters-Interview. “Es ist schon komisch, so ein Ende zu erleben.” Der 60-jährige Amerikaner ist ein Urgestein bei Air Berlin, seit 1977 Pilot und seit 27 Jahren für die rot-weißen Farben unterwegs.

Unternehmerisch lief leider nicht immer alles gut.” Seit dem Börsengang summierten sich die Verluste auf rund drei Milliarden Euro - im Schnitt etwa 25 Millionen Euro im Monat, wie der Konzern mitteilte.

Kapitän McCaleb wird zusammen mit seinem Kollegen Roland Koch am Abend den Flug AB 6210 von München nach Berlin-Tegel steuern. Der ausgebuchte Airbus A320 mit der Registrierung D-ABNW soll um 22.45 Uhr in der Hauptstadt landen und beendet eine Ära. Air Berlin stellt dann seinen Flugbetrieb in Eigenregie ein. Die 178 Passagiere und acht Besatzungsmitglieder dürften am Airport von einer Wasserfontäne der Flughafenfeuerwehr begrüßt werden - wie bei solchen Ereignissen üblich.

“FLIEGEN IST MEIN LEBEN UND MEINE BERUFUNG”

Von den ehemals 8000 Beschäftigten der Air Berlin verlieren wohl Tausende ihren Job, nur wenige werden von Käufern verschiedener Unternehmensteile wie der Lufthansa übernommen.

The S&P technology index led the way higher, up 3.14 percent. The index was on track for its best day since March 1, 2016 and is up nearly 35 percent on the year versus the 15.2 percent gain in the S&P 500.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.30 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 7.16 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services.

Further lifting the sector were shares of Apple (AAPL.O), which rose 3.83 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. Intel (INTC.O) soared 8.10 percent after its quarterly results topped estimates and the chipmaker raised its full-year forecasts.

Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.15 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Its gains helped lift the consumer discretionary sector 1.53 percent to put the index on pace for its best daily performance since Dec. 7.

“People are concerned about overvaluation, people are concerned about what is the catalyst for those guys to attract too much attention from regulators,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

“They are the ones that everyone wants to own, has to own because they are the ones reporting the best earnings. They definitely came through, that is very positive.”

Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a 3-percent annual rate, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities.

A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank provided support for stocks. In Powell’s potential appointment, investors see a continuation of the current monetary policy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 23,436.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.22 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,581.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 147.33 points, or 2.25 percent, to 6,704.10.

Earnings growth for the third quarter is now 6.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 273 companies that have posted earnings, 74 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 72 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Not all earnings were positive, however. Chevron’s (CVX.N) 4.53 percent fall weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil company’s profit missed estimates.

Merck (MRK.N) dropped 6.58 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.","Tech, Amazon earnings power Wall St. higher",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks/tech-amazon-earnings-power-wall-street-higher-idINKBN1CW1SX?il=0

Picture taken October 21, 2017. REUTERS/Maria Tsvetkova

The document, a death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus dated Oct. 4, 2017, does not say what the deceased was doing in Syria.

But Reuters has established in interviews with the families and friends of some of the deceased and officials in their hometowns that the dead included Russian private military contractors killed while fighting alongside the forces of Moscow’s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The presence of the Russian contractors in Syria - and the casualties they are sustaining - is denied by Moscow, which wants to portray its military intervention in Syria as a successful peace mission with minimal losses.

The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters. Requests for comment from the Russian consulate in Damascus did not elicit a response.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday: “We do not have information about individual citizens who visit Syria. With that, I consider this question dealt with.”

Reuters sent questions to a group of Russian private military contractors active in Syria through a person who knows their commanders, but did not receive a response.

The official death toll of military personnel in Syria this year is 16. A casualty figure significantly higher than that could tarnish President Vladimir Putin’s record five months before a presidential election which he is expected to contest.

A Reuters count of the number of Russian private contractors known to have been killed in Syria this year, based on interviews with relatives and friends of the dead and local officials in their hometowns, stands at 26.

Russian authorities have not publicly released any information this year about casualties among Russian civilians who may have been caught up in the fighting.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in response to Reuters questions, said the consulate in Syria was fulfilling its duties to register the deaths of Russian citizens. It said that under the law, personal data obtained in the process of registering the deaths was restricted and could not be publicly disclosed.

In August, Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said in response to a previous Reuters report that information about Russian military contractors in Syria was “a myth”, and that Reuters was attempting to discredit Moscow’s operation to restore peace in Syria.

UNUSUAL

A Russian diplomat who has worked in a consulate in another part of the world, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the figure of 131 registered deaths in nine months was unusually high given the estimated number of Russian expatriates in Syria.

Although there is no official data for the size of the community, data from Russian national elections shows there were only around 5,000 registered Russian voters in the country in 2012 and 2016.

“It is as if the diaspora is dying out,” he said.

High numbers of deaths are usually recorded by Russian consulates only in tourist destinations such as Thailand or Turkey, he said.

Russian consulates do not register the deaths of military personnel, according to an official at the consulate in Damascus who did not give his name.

The consular document seen by Reuters was a “certificate of death” issued to record the death of Sergei Poddubny, 36. It was one of three death certificates seen by Reuters.

Poddubny’s certificate, which bears the consulate’s stamp, lists the cause of death as “carbonization of the body” - in other words, he was burned.

It said he was killed on Sept. 28 in the town of Tiyas, Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting between Islamist rebels and pro-Assad forces. Several Russian contractors were killed in the area earlier this year, friends and relatives told Reuters.

Poddubny’s body was repatriated and buried in his home village in southern Russia about three weeks later. He had been in Syria as a private military contractor, one of his relatives and one of his friends told Reuters.

Poddubny’s death certificate had a serial number in the top right corner, 131.

Under a Justice Ministry procedure, all death certificates are numbered, starting from zero at the start of the year and going up by one digit for each new death recorded.

The Russian diplomat confirmed that is the procedure.

Reuters saw two other certificates, both issued on Feb. 3. The numbers - 9 and 13 - indicate certificates for at least five deaths were issued on that day. They were both private military contractors, according to people who know them.

The death of a Russian citizen would have to be registered at the consulate in order to repatriate the body back to Russia via civilian channels, according to the Russian diplomat.

A death certificate from the consulate would also help with bureaucracy back home relating to the dead person’s assets, the diplomat said.

The bodies of Russians fighting on the rebel side are not repatriated, according to a former Russian official who dealt with at least six cases of Russians killed in Syria and the relatives of four Russian Islamists killed there.

Shares of Aetna, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, were marginally up in early trading on Friday, after closing 12 percent higher on Thursday following reports of the deal. CVS Health was down about 1 percent.

CVS Health has made an offer to acquire No. 3 U.S. health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, making it the biggest deal of the year, Reuters reported on Thursday.

“A potential combination would diversify CVS profit streams ahead of an Amazon entry and set the stage for a new healthcare-retail delivery model,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

Amazon.com Inc’s speculated entry has hit shares of most drugstore operators on fears that the online retailer would leverage its vast ecommerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.

“We believe CVS does need to respond to the potential threat and strike a different path,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a note.

A deal would make CVS-Aetna a one-stop shop for customers’ health care needs - ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores.

The vertical integration of retail pharmacy, PBM, and insurers fits with broader healthcare themes of expanded access, consumerism and cost reduction, Jefferies analysts said, adding that the deal chatter was not a complete surprise.

“It would address each company’s need for a fresh script.”

Some analysts said the deal could also trigger a wave of consolidation across the industry.

It could be a possible catalyst for higher health insurance sector valuation, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Bosch said, adding that WellCare Health Plans, Humana and Centene could be possible acquisition targets.

FILE PHOTO: Akzo Nobel's logo is seen in Amsterdam, Netherlands, February 16, 2012. REUTERS/Robin van Lonkhuijsen/United Photos/File Photo

Akzo Nobel’s move indicates that its new CEO Thierry Vanlancker is continuing to look for big deals as a way to buttress the company, after it managed to fend off a takeover approach by PPG Industries (PPG.N) earlier this year.

Philadelphia-based Axalta is in the early stages of considering a deal with Akzo Nobel, and there is no certainty that the two companies will agree to a merger, one of the sources said on Friday.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Akzo Nobel and Axalta did not respond to requests for comment.

Shares in Axalta soared nearly 22 percent on the news and were last up 18 percent at $33.27 in early afternoon trading, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.1 billion. Akzo Nobel’s shares had finished flat in Amsterdam, valuing it at 19.5 billion euros.

Earlier this year, the Dutch maker of Dulux rejected a 26-billion euro acquisition offer from U.S. rival PPG. As an alternative transaction, Akzo Nobel has announced it plans to sell or spin off its specialty chemicals division, which represents about a third of sales and profits.

Such a divestiture will concentrate Akzo on coatings, and so a tie-up with Axalta, the No. 1 supplier to the North American heavy truck market, would round out its business to include vehicle coatings.

PPG CEO Michael McGarry said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call earlier this month that, when it came to Akzo Nobel, PPG had “moved on.” A PPG spokesman declined to comment on Friday on how the company will respond to Akzo Nobel’s merger discussions with Axalta.

A tie-up with Axalta, the former car paint unit of DuPont, is be the major first merger being pursued by Vanlancker, who took over as Akzo Nobel CEO when Ton Buechner resigned for health reasons in July.

Vanlancker has cut Buechner’s profit goals, made in the heat of the takeover battle, twice in the space of six weeks, blaming disruption caused by hurricane Harvey, rising raw materials costs and “headwinds” at its marine coatings business.

He has also focused on trying to cultivate Akzo Nobel’s investor base. Having won a court case in which activist investor Elliott Advisors sought but failed to get the removal of president Antony Burgmans, Akzo Nobel pledged to mend its relationship with shareholders.

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s $999 price tag could weigh on demand.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

Embora a declaração catalã pareça ser um gesto condenado ao fracasso, as medidas dos dois lados levam a pior crise política do país em quatro décadas a um patamar novo e possivelmente perigoso.

O primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, pediu calma e disse que o Estado de Direito será restaurado na Catalunha, onde secessionistas nutrem há tempos o sonho de uma nação separada.

Uma multidão de mais de 2 mil apoiadores da independência se reuniu no Parque Ciutadella, diante do Parlamento localizado em Barcelona, gritando “liberdade” em catalão e cantando canções tradicionais enquanto a votação da separação transcorria.

A moção foi aprovada pela legislatura depois de um debate apaixonado entre defensores e opositores da independência em que se decretou que a Catalunha constitui um Estado independente, soberano e social democrata.

O líder catalão, Carles Puigdemont, deixou a câmara aos gritos de “Presidente!”, e prefeitos que haviam chegado de áreas adjacentes brandiram seus bastões cerimoniais e cantaram o hino catalão “Os Ceifadores”.

“A Catalunha é e será uma terra de liberdade. Em tempos de dificuldade e em tempos de comemoração. Agora mais do que nunca”, tuitou Puigdemont.

Mas imediatamente após a notícia da votação, que três partidos de oposição boicotaram, as ações e títulos espanhóis começaram a ser descartados, refletindo o temor do mercado com o tumulto na região rica.

Em uma hora a câmara alta do Parlamento espanhol em Madri autorizou o governo de Rajoy a controlar a Catalunha diretamente – uma medida inédita na Espanha desde a volta da democracia no final dos anos 1970.

Em Bruxelas, o presidente do Conselho Europeu, Donald Tusk, disse que a votação de independência não mudou nada e que a União Europeia só lidará com o governo central.

Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, França e Alemanha também rejeitaram a declaração rapidamente e expressaram apoio aos esforços de Rajoy para manter a Espanha unida.

Seu gabinete estava se reunindo na noite local desta sexta-feira para adotar as primeiras medidas para governar a Catalunha, o que pode implicar em destituir o governo de Barcelona e assumir a supervisão direta das forças policiais catalãs.

“Medidas excepcionais só deveriam ser adotadas quando nenhum outro remédio é possível”, disse Rajoy no Senado na manhã desta sexta-feira.

“Em minha opinião, não há alternativa. A única coisa que pode ser feita é aceitar e cumprir a lei”, afirmou o premiê, que adotou uma postura inflexível contra a campanha independentista da Catalunha.

Mas como o controle direto funcionará na prática – incluindo a reação de servidores civis e da polícia – é incerto. Alguns apoiadores da independência prometeram montar uma campanha de desobediência civil.

“Não será fácil, não será de graça, não mudará em um dia. Mas não há alternativa a um processo rumo à República Catalã”, disse a parlamentar Marta Rovira, da aliança pró-independência Junts pel Si alliance, no debate que levou à votação.

Uttar Pradesh raised the cane price to 315 rupees ($4.85) per 100 kg for the crop year that began this month, up from 305 rupees in the previous year, the state official, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak with media, told Reuters by telephone.

“We feel that the SAP (state advised price) fixed by the Uttar Pradesh government is reasonable and can be absorbed by the sugar industry,” Vijay S Banka, chief financial officer of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Ltd, said in a statement.

India, the world’s biggest sugar consumer, is expected to produce 25.1 million tonnes of the sweetener in the season that began on Oct. 1, up from 20.3 million tonnes in the previous year, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association.

Dry weather conditions crimped sugar output in the 2016/17 season and forced the government to allow imports of more than half a million tonnes of the sweetener.

Reasonably sufficient monsoon rains this year and large-scale plantings of high-yielding cane varieties are expected to help mills churn out more sugar this year, obviating the need to import sugar.

Higher volumes will also help sugar companies generate more revenues from allied activities such as electricity generation, said Banka.

Indian consumers, who have a famously sweet tooth, are expected to use about 25 million tonnes of sugar in the 2017/18 season, nearly half a million tonnes more than the previous year.

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis.

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other. It’s ironic that it may be the routing of extremist IS that serves as the catalyst to ease the bitter sectarian rifts that have divided them for so long.",Commentary: The unlikely – and ironic – effects of Islamic State’s fall in Iraq,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-behravesh-afterislamicstate-commentar/commentary-the-unlikely-and-ironic-effects-of-islamic-states-fall-in-iraq-idUSKBN1CU2LW

An article in ESPN The Magazine, posted online on Friday, quoted Bob McNair as saying, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison” as he exhorted other team owners in a meeting to consider how the protests could hurt the league’s bottom line.

“I regret that I used that expression,” McNair, 79, said in a statement. “I never meant to offend anyone and I was not referring to our players. I used a figure of speech that was never intended to be taken literally.”

A number of players, mostly African-American, have knelt or raised fists during the “Star-Spangled Banner” to protest the treatment of minorities by police officers and racial inequality in the criminal justice system. Others have stood arm-in-arm in a show of solidarity.

President Donald Trump escalated the controversy in September, when he suggested owners should fire any “son of a bitch” who refused to stand for the anthem.

Trump has portrayed kneeling as an insult to the military and has kept up his attacks on Twitter, fueling further demonstrations from players.

The debate over the protests dominated a two-day meeting earlier this month in New York among league executives and team owners, where McNair is said to have made the comment. The league ultimately rejected Trump’s call for protesting players to be punished.

ESPN reported that NFL executive Troy Vincent, a former player, told the owners he was offended by McNair’s words, and that McNair apologized to him after the meeting.

McNair gave money to Trump’s presidential campaign last year, as did many other NFL owners.

The protests began in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, began sitting and later kneeling during the anthem to call attention to several high-profile shootings of unarmed black men in the United States.

Kaepernick was not signed by any team after becoming a free agent following the 2016 season. He has filed a claim of illegal collusion against the league’s owners.

A Seton Hall University poll on Friday found 47 percent of respondents believe the NFL should order players to stand during the anthem, while 42 percent do not.

Most people, by a 55-to-37 percent margin, also said it was inappropriate for Trump to launch a recent petition on the Republican National Committee website saying the players should stand.",Owner of NFL's Texans sorry for 'inmates' comment on protesting players,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-anthem-texans/owner-of-nfls-texans-sorry-for-inmates-comment-on-protesting-players-idUSKBN1CW2LA

The country is selling $2 billion of five-and 10-year sovereign dollar bonds, the first such issue since 2004. Despite recent downgrades by global rating agencies, these are likely to yield just 30 to 50 basis points above U.S. Treasury bonds. Local banks can guarantee demand if needed, but there is also a genuine reassessment of China risk underway.

China does not need the money, but the borrowing serves multiple purposes. It helps stabilise cross-border capital flows, refills hard-currency reserves, and makes it easier for companies to refinance in dollars, since there will now be benchmark issues to price against. It is also a rebuke to the credit rating agencies, showing China can brush aside their warnings.

It is already a banner year for offshore fundraising. Thomson Reuters IFR says Chinese issuers have sold $108 billion of overseas bonds in dollars, euros and yen by the end of September, already 24 percent above 2016’s full-year record.

For all the hype about the international yuan, it’s naturally easier for Chinese companies to use dollars for overseas acquisitions. Ditto for “Belt and Road” infrastructure investments. But appetite for dollars has come at the expense of the offshore yuan market, once a policy priority. The Ministry of Finance is only selling 14 billion yuan ($2 billion) of so-called “dim sum” bonds in Hong Kong this year, half of the previous year’s issuance.

Even so, this is an unrated issue by a country infamous for credit-fuelled growth, weak rule of law, and selective respect for international norms. It’s one thing to lend money to the Chinese government, but this will serve as a benchmark for pricing debt sales by other Chinese borrowers, some of them far more opaque.

The MoF has previously manipulated offshore bond sales by force-feeding them to compliant Chinese banks. This simulates demand without market substance. This time around, however, the securities may attract more foreign interest: as the mainland economy has recovered, foreign anxiety has genuinely eased. Spreads on Chinese five-year credit default swaps have fallen sharply in 2017, and now trade more than 20 basis points below South Korea’s.",Breakingviews - Beijing's dollar bonds seek to reprice China risk,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-bonds-breakingviews/breakingviews-beijings-dollar-bonds-seek-to-reprice-china-risk-idUSKBN1CV0BS

The private sector bank is still waiting for the final report of the central bank’s annual supervision exercise, Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar told reporters on a conference call, adding they will disclose the findings of this audit in the third quarter.

As part of this review, the central bank looks to see if banks have correctly classified loans, taking into account repayment trends and other factors.

A record $145 billion soured loans due to an economic slowdown and, in some cases, profligate lending has stifled new bank credit in India. But private sector banks have been able to gain market share from their dominant state-run rivals which account for bulk of the troubled loans.

But some of ICICI’s private sector rivals have disclosed additional bad loans following a central bank audit of their books for the last financial year.

A $32 billion recapitalisation for the state-run banks announced this week also risks curtailing the private-sector banks’ competitive advantage and their higher valuations.

Kochhar reiterated that the bank expected total bad loan additions in the current financial year to March to be lower than last year. She forecast domestic loan growth in the financial year to be about 15 percent, led by as much 20 percent rise in retail loans.

ICICI, among the three domestic banks considered “too big to fail” by the country’s central bank, reported a net profit of 20.58 billion rupees ($316.51 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analysts’ expectations of 24.91 billion rupees.

Non-interest income in the quarter included gains of 20.12 billion rupees from sale of stake in the initial public offering of unit ICICI Lombard General Insurance, ICICI said, lower than 56.82 billion rupees raked in from the stake sale in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance in the year ago quarter.

ICICI, which has the highest bad loans in absolute terms among private-sector lenders in the country, said its total provisions, including for loan losses, were 45.03 billion rupees in the September quarter, higher than 26.09 billion rupees three months ago, but 36 percent lower than a year ago.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans stood at 7.87 percent at end-September, versus 7.99 percent at end-June and 6.12 percent a year ago. Net interest income and fee income rose by 9 percent each in the quarter.

The Republican-controlled House voted 216-212 to pass a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year. The measure will enable the tax legislation, due to be introduced next week, to win congressional approval without any Democratic votes.

But House Republican leaders came within two votes of failure. Democrats were unified in their opposition, and 20 Republicans voted against the bill, many expressing disapproval of a provision that would repeal an income tax deduction for state and local taxes.

Discord is also looming over a potential provision to scale back a popular tax-deferred U.S. retirement savings program known as a 401(k). Both those provisions are aimed at offsetting revenue losses that would result from the planned sweeping tax cuts, particularly for companies.

Democrats have called the tax plan a giveaway to the rich and corporations that would swell the federal deficit.

Republicans are traditionally opposed to letting the deficit grow. But in a stark reversal of that stance, the party’s budget resolution, previously passed by the Senate, called for adding up to $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over the next decade to pay for the tax cuts.

Several conservative Republicans voted against it because of deficit concerns. One of them, Representative Justin Amash, wrote on Twitter, “What happened to fiscal conservatism?”

The outline of the Republican plan announced last month would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

Trump, who promised major tax cuts as a candidate last year, has asked Congress to pass the tax legislation by the end of the year. Even though his fellow Republicans control both the House and Senate, the president has been unable to secure passage of major legislation, having failed to repeal the Obamacare law.

Republicans are also looking for a signature achievement as the 2018 congressional election year approaches.

“Big News - Budget just passed!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has said he wants the House to pass the tax overhaul by the Nov. 23 Thanksgiving holiday, said passage of the budget resolution was an “enormous step” toward that goal.

But he declined to take a position on the possibility of capping annual tax-free contributions into 401(k) plans, which for four decades have helped millions of Americans save for retirement by offering tax savings.

Trump and Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, reopened the door to the possibility of such caps on Wednesday as Republicans scramble to find sources of revenue to cover the tax cuts.

Brady on Thursday said he was working toward an agreement on the 401(k) issue with Trump and Republicans who want to keep the tax break in place.

“They made it clear. They need this problem solved before they vote ‘yes’ on tax reform,” Brady added.

Brady said he planned to introduce the tax bill next Wednesday and to begin committee deliberations on it the following week, on Nov. 6.

REVOLT FROM HIGH-TAX STATES

Eliminating the deduction would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Republican Representative John Katko of New York, leaving a meeting with Brady, said supporters of the deduction “stood firm, saying ‘no’ as a group today to let them know we’re not kidding.”

But one Republican senator warned that his party will have to stick to its commitment to eliminate tax breaks.

“If groups see that you’re willing to deal something away if they raise enough Cain, the whole thing’s going to fall apart. We’ve gotta hang tough,” Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said on CNBC.

The budget plan will enable the 100-seat Senate to pass tax legislation with a simple majority rather than a 60-vote super-majority, hard to reach given Democrats’ opposition. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 margin in the Senate.

The White House and congressional Republicans excluded Democrats as they developed the plan.

“Right here before our eyes, in this House, the Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver spoon of plutocracy and aristocracy,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said during the debate on the budget measure.

Independent analysts forecast last month that corporations and the wealthiest Americans would benefit the most and many upper middle-income people would face higher taxes under the tax outline unveiled by the Republicans.

The proposal would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, the analysts said.",House narrowly passes measure paving way for Trump tax cuts,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/house-narrowly-passes-measure-paving-way-for-trump-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1CV19J

Although the Catalan declaration appears to be a doomed gesture, both sides’ moves take Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades to a new and possibly dangerous level.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for calm and said the rule of law would be restored in Catalonia, where secessionists have long cherished the dream of a separate nation.

A crowd of more than 2,000 independence supporters gathered in the Ciutadella Park outside the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting “Liberty” in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through.

The motion passed in the parliament after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of “President!” and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem “Els Segadors” (The Reapers).

“Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever”, Puigdemont said on Twitter.

But immediately after news of the vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil in the wealthy region.

Within an hour, the upper house of Spain’s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy’s government to rule Catalonia directly -- an unprecedented move in Spain since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.

The United States, Britain, France and Germany also swiftly dismissed the declaration and expressed support for Rajoy’s efforts to keep Spain united.

FIRING THE GOVERNMENT?

Rajoy’s cabinet was meeting on Friday evening to adopt the first measures to govern Catalonia. This could include firing the Barcelona government and assuming direct supervision of Catalan police forces.

“Exceptional measures should only be adopted when no other remedy is possible,” Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an address to the Senate on Friday morning.

“In my opinion there is no alternative. The only thing that can be done and should be done is to accept and comply with the law,” said Rajoy, who has staked out an uncompromising position.

How direct rule would work on the ground - including the reaction of civil servants and the police - is uncertain. Some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow “peaceful resistance”.

“Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,” Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.

“Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.”

The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. National flags now hang from many balconies in the capital in an expression of unity.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.

The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

NOT EASY

“It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be free, it is not going to change in a day. But there is no alternative to a process towards the Catalan Republic,” lawmaker Marta Rovira of the Junts pel Si pro-independence alliance said in a debate leading to the vote.

After the debate, lawmakers from members of three main national parties -- the People’s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos -- walked out. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favor in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them.

Spain’s constitutional court said it was reviewing the vote. The state prosecutor and other parties have three days to open a case.

Montserrat Rectoret, a 61-year-old historian, was among the crowds in Barcelona.

“I am emotional because Catalonia has struggled for 40 years to be independent and finally I can see it,” she said.","Catalonia declares independence from Spain, direct Madrid rule looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-independence/catalonia-declares-independence-from-spain-direct-madrid-rule-looms-idINKBN1CW1XC

The document, a death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus dated Oct. 4, 2017, does not say what the deceased was doing in Syria.

But Reuters has established in interviews with the families and friends of some of the deceased and officials in their hometowns that the dead included Russian private military contractors killed while fighting alongside the forces of Moscow’s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The presence of the Russian contractors in Syria - and the casualties they are sustaining - is denied by Moscow, which wants to portray its military intervention in Syria as a successful peace mission with minimal losses.

The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters. Requests for comment from the Russian consulate in Damascus did not elicit a response.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday: “We do not have information about individual citizens who visit Syria. With that, I consider this question dealt with.”

Reuters sent questions to a group of Russian private military contractors active in Syria through a person who knows their commanders, but did not receive a response.

The official death toll of military personnel in Syria this year is 16. A casualty figure significantly higher than that could tarnish President Vladimir Putin’s record five months before a presidential election which he is expected to contest.

A Reuters count of the number of Russian private contractors known to have been killed in Syria this year, based on interviews with relatives and friends of the dead and local officials in their hometowns, stands at 26.

Russian authorities have not publicly released any information this year about casualties among Russian civilians who may have been caught up in the fighting.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in response to Reuters questions, said the consulate in Syria was fulfilling its duties to register the deaths of Russian citizens. It said that under the law, personal data obtained in the process of registering the deaths was restricted and could not be publicly disclosed.

In August, Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said in response to a previous Reuters report that information about Russian military contractors in Syria was “a myth”, and that Reuters was attempting to discredit Moscow’s operation to restore peace in Syria.

UNUSUAL

A Russian diplomat who has worked in a consulate in another part of the world, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the figure of 131 registered deaths in nine months was unusually high given the estimated number of Russian expatriates in Syria.

Although there is no official data for the size of the community, data from Russian national elections shows there were only around 5,000 registered Russian voters in the country in 2012 and 2016.

“It is as if the diaspora is dying out,” he said.

High numbers of deaths are usually recorded by Russian consulates only in tourist destinations such as Thailand or Turkey, he said.

Russian consulates do not register the deaths of military personnel, according to an official at the consulate in Damascus who did not give his name.

The consular document seen by Reuters was a “certificate of death” issued to record the death of Sergei Poddubny, 36. It was one of three death certificates seen by Reuters.

Poddubny’s certificate, which bears the consulate’s stamp, lists the cause of death as “carbonization of the body” - in other words, he was burned.

It said he was killed on Sept. 28 in the town of Tiyas, Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting between Islamist rebels and pro-Assad forces. Several Russian contractors were killed in the area earlier this year, friends and relatives told Reuters.

Poddubny’s body was repatriated and buried in his home village in southern Russia about three weeks later. He had been in Syria as a private military contractor, one of his relatives and one of his friends told Reuters.

Poddubny’s death certificate had a serial number in the top right corner, 131.

Under a Justice Ministry procedure, all death certificates are numbered, starting from zero at the start of the year and going up by one digit for each new death recorded.

The Russian diplomat confirmed that is the procedure.

Reuters saw two other certificates, both issued on Feb. 3. The numbers - 9 and 13 - indicate certificates for at least five deaths were issued on that day. They were both private military contractors, according to people who know them.

The death of a Russian citizen would have to be registered at the consulate in order to repatriate the body back to Russia via civilian channels, according to the Russian diplomat.

A death certificate from the consulate would also help with bureaucracy back home relating to the dead person’s assets, the diplomat said.

The bodies of Russians fighting on the rebel side are not repatriated, according to a former Russian official who dealt with at least six cases of Russians killed in Syria and the relatives of four Russian Islamists killed there.

A few thousand Russian citizens with Islamist sympathies have traveled to rebel-held areas since the conflict began in 2011, according to Russian officials.",Exclusive: Death certificate offers clues on Russian casualties in Syria,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CW1LO

An Apple spokesman confirmed the acquisition, which was earlier reported in New Zealand media. Both companies declined to provide details of the purchase.

Wireless charging allows users to recharge devices by placing them on a pad or other surface rather than inserting them in a cradle or attaching a cable.

Apple has been slow to adopt the technology, lagging behind its biggest rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other mobile phone companies that have offered wireless charging in some of their devices for several years.

Apple joined the industry body that develops the Qi wireless charging standard, the Wireless Power Consortium, in February. The iPhone 8 and X both support the standard.

Apple’s interest in PowerbyProxi may be driven by the latter’s other products, some of which can support transferring up to 150 watts through any non-metallic material, for wirelessly charging industrial machinery and medical equipment, said Jake Saunders, Asia Pacific vice president of ABI Research.

This could allow Apple to offer much larger pads that could quickly charge multiple consumer devices, including laptops and even electric scooters, he added.

For consumers, charging a single device on one pad may not be that appealing, “but when you get into multiple device charging it starts to get attractive”, Saunders said.

Apple recently announced its own AirPower accessory which it said would simultaneously charge up to three devices, including new versions of the Apple Watch, iPhone and AirPod charging case.

PowerbyProxi was founded in 2007 as a spin-out of the University of Auckland. Samsung Ventures, global investment arm of Samsung Group, invested $4 million in the company in 2013.

Präsident Donald Trump favorisiere ihn für die Nominierung, berichtete die Finanzagentur Bloomberg am Freitag unter Berufung auf mehrere Insider. Trump hatte Powell sowie den Ökonomen John Taylor in die engere Wahl genommen. Zugleich sagte er aber auch, er schätze die jetzige Chefin Janet Yellen. Deren Amtszeit läuft Anfang Februar 2018 aus. In Washington wird erwartet, dass Trump die Personalie bekanntgibt, bevor er in einer Woche zu einer Asienreise aufbricht. Der vom Präsidenten nominierte Kandidat muss noch vom US-Senat bestätigt werden.

Mit dem 64-jährigen Powell würde ein Währungshüter an die Spitze der mächtigsten Notenbank der Welt rücken, der bereits seit Jahren in deren Führungsetage sitzt. “Als Chef dürfte er wohl die Politik der schrittweisen Normalisierung der Geldpolitik fortsetzen, die Amtsinhaberin Janet Yellen eingeleitet hat”, hatten die Volkswirte der UniCredit vor kurzem prognostiziert. Yellen und ihre Kollegen haben die Zügel nach einer jahrelange Nullzinsphase angesichts des anhaltenden Aufschwungs in den USA stufenweise gestrafft - auf das aktuelle Leitzinsniveau von 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent. Sie will es bis zum Jahresende weiter erhöhen, falls es die Konjunkturlage zulässt.

Experten hatten bereits in den vergangenen Tagen Powell als wahrscheinlichsten Kandidaten bezeichnet. Der Jurist und frühere Investmentbanker ist im Führungsgremium der einzige Republikaner - ebenso wie Trump.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Apesar de o bônus ter ficado abaixo do previsto (7,7 bilhões de reais), uma vez que o governo tinha a expectativa de que todos os blocos seriam arrematados, o governo levou elevados percentuais de óleo nas rodadas, que foram sob partilha de produção, com forte competição nas áreas de Peroba e Norte de Carcará.

Nas licitações de partilha, as empresas vencedoras são as que oferecem ao Estado brasileiro, a partir de um percentual mínimo fixado, o maior percentual de excedente em óleo. O bônus é fixo.

Apenas consórcios liderados por empresas que já são operadoras no pré-sal brasileiro (Petrobras, Shell e Statoil) venceram o leilão, ante expectativa do governo de ver uma diversificação das lideranças na importante província petrolífera.

“Nossa participação foi super ativa, estou extremamente feliz e seremos operadores em dois blocos, o que é extremamente importante para nós”, disse o CEO da Shell no Brasil, André Araújo, a jornalistas.

Apesar de a operação das novas áreas seguir nas mãos das companhias que já atuam no Brasil, o leilão mostrou a entrada de novas empresas no polígono do pré-sal, como a norte-americana Exxon.

Na lei atual, áreas do polígono do pré-sal apenas podem ser leiloadas sob regime de partilha de produção.

Como esperado pelo mercado, as áreas de Entorno de Sapinhoá e Gato do Mato foram arrematadas por consórcios que já atuam em áreas adjacentes.

No caso do Entorno de Sapinhoá, o consórcio vencedor foi Petrobras, Shell e Repsol Sinopec. Já no caso de Gato do Mato, venceram as petroleiras Shell e Total.

Peroba, área bastante concorrida no dia, com a disputa de três consórcios, foi vencida por Petrobras, BP e CNODC, com oferta de 76,96 por cento de óleo à União.

A área de Carcará foi vencida pelo consórcio Statoil, Exxon e Petrogal, marcando novamente o interesse da gigante Exxon no pré-sal brasileiro.

A área de Alto de Cabo Frio Central foi levada por Petrobras e BP e Alto de Cabo Frio Oeste, por Shell, QPI e CNOOC.

Pau Brasil e Sudoeste de Tartaruga Verde não receberam lances, mesmo após duas oportunidades oferecidas para cada uma durante os leilões. Ambas as áreas voltarão a ser ofertadas em algum momento, segundo a reguladora ANP.","Shell se destaca em leilão com pré-sal; Petrobras garante espaço, além de Exxon",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN1CW2HT-OBRTP

Der wegen der Abgasmanipulationen viel gescholtene Wolfsburger Konzern präsentierte am Freitag dank Einsparungen und teils kräftig gestiegener Auslieferungen - etwa in Südamerika, Osteuropa und den USA - ein überraschend hohes Ergebnis. Der Betriebsgewinn vor Sondereinflüssen lag im dritten Quartal bei 4,3 Milliarden Euro, 15 Prozent mehr als vor Jahresfrist. Abzüglich weiterer Rückstellungen für “Dieselgate” blieb operativ immer noch ein Ergebnis von 1,7 Milliarden Euro, auch das war mehr als von Experten erwartet.

Bei der operativen Rendite erwartet der weltgrößte Autobauer nun, dass die bisher für 2017 in Aussicht gestellte Spanne von 6,0 bis 7,0 Prozent “moderat” übertroffen wird. Den Ausblick für den Umsatz bekräftigte der Konzern. Demnach sollen die Erlöse in diesem Jahr um mehr als vier Prozent zulegen.

Trotz des guten Abschneidens hielt sich die Führungsspitze um Konzernchef Matthias Müller mit Euphorie zurück: “Das Ergebnis der ersten neun Monate gibt uns mit Blick auf das Gesamtjahr eine Menge Zuversicht”, sagte Finanzchef Frank Witter. “Das ist ein starkes Fundament, auf das wir aufbauen können.” Mit einer Nettoliquidität von mehr als 25 Milliarden Euro in seinem Kerngeschäft habe der Konzern zudem ein ausreichend dickes Polster, sollten sich neue Probleme auftun.

Anleger bejubelten die Zahlen. Die VW-Aktie legte um drei Prozent zu und war damit zum Wochenausklang größter Gewinner im Leitindex Dax.

LANGER ANLAUF

Analysten führten das Gewinnplus auf die Entscheidungen früherer Jahre zurück. “Volkswagen ist ein Unternehmen, das offenbar einen extrem langen Anlauf braucht”, sagte Marc-René Tonn vom Bankhaus M.M. Warburg. “Wir sehen nun zunehmend die Einsparungen und den Ergebnishub aus den modularen Baukästen.” Der Konzern hatte bereits vor einigen Jahren eine Gleichteilestrategie eingeführt, von der zunehmend alle Marken profitieren. Dadurch steigt die Ertragskraft. Die lange schwächelnde Hauptmarke VW etwa verdoppelte die operative Rendite nun auf 3,8 Prozent von 1,5 Prozent vor einem Jahr.

“Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass sich der Cash-flow so stark entwickeln würde, gerade vor dem Hintergrund der jüngsten Abflüsse von 2,5 Milliarden durch Dieselgate”, sagte Stefan Bauknecht, Chef-Aktienanalyst der Deutsche-Bank-Tochter Deutsche Asset Management. Der Konzern habe ein enormes Potenzial, um die Effizienz zu steigern.

“EINFACH SAUSTARK”

Arndt Ellinghorst vom Investmentberater Evercore ISI verwies darauf, dass Volkswagen bisher insgesamt 17,5 Milliarden Euro für die Wiedergutmachung der Abgasmanipulationen bezahlt hat. VW ließ offen, wofür das Geld im Einzelnen ausgegeben wurde. Trotzdem der hohen Belastungen hatte der Konzern Ende September 25,4 Milliarden Euro Netto-Liquidität in der Kasse. “Das ist einfach saustark”, lobte der Autoanalyst. Auch er ist der Ansicht, dass Volkswagen seine Potenziale noch längst nicht gehoben hat. Ellinghorst schätzt, dass allein 16 Milliarden an Effizienzsteigerungen möglich sind. Davon sei vermutlich nicht alles zu realisieren, weil der Autobauer viel investieren müsse, etwa um den Bedarf an Batteriezellen zu decken, die für die Vielzahl an angekündigten Elektroautos nötig sind. Unter dem Strich verdiente Volkswagen im dritten Quartal 1,1 Milliarden Euro, halb so viel wie vor Jahresfrist.

Frank Schwope von der NordLB geht davon aus, dass der Konzern das Finanzpolster dringend benötigt, weil in dem Dieseldrama längst nicht der letzte Akt gespielt sei. Der Autoanalyst schätzt, dass die Gesamtkosten auf 35 Milliarden Euro steigen könnten. Zudem könnten weitere Kosten auf den Konzern zukommen, wenn die EU-Kommission Belege für illegale Absprachen unter den fünf großen deutschen Autoherstellern finden sollte. Volkswagen hatte sich - wie Daimler auch - selbst bei der EU angezeigt, um mögliche Kartellvergehen prüfen zu lassen.

In Sachen Dieselgate hatte Volkswagen im vergangenen Jahr mit Anwälten und US-Behörden einen Milliarden-Kompromiss ausgehandelt, der die Reparatur und den Rückkauf von betroffenen Fahrzeuge sowie Entschädigungen vorsieht. Einschließlich Strafen und Investitionen in die Elektromobilität, die Volkswagen als Teil der Wiedergutmachung in den USA zusagen musste, belaufen sich die Rückstellungen inzwischen auf 25,2 Milliarden Euro.","Volkswagen lässt ""Dieselgate"" abperlen - Prognose angehoben",https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-volkswagen-idDEKBN1CW0RL

Imperial’s realized crude oil price of C$49.03 per barrel was C$9 higher for the latest quarter, but total expenses rose 6.4 percent to C$6.7 billion, and production dipped to average 390,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day from 393,000 boepd a year earlier.

Still, Imperial realized an 18 percent increase in production from the second quarter of 2017, returning it to profitability. Production in the first half of the year had been negatively affected by factors including a fire at the Syncrude Mildred Lake upgrader.

“Imperial Oil’s operations are very attractive, in our view, and should support healthy growth over the long term, although in the nearer term it will mostly focus on improving existing operations,” Edward Jones analysts said in a note to clients.

The company reported a net profit of C$371 million ($287.80 million), or 44 Canadian cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 46 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Domino, who for a while was mistakenly thought to have been killed when Hurricane Katrina devastated his New Orleans neighborhood in 2005, died at home on Tuesday of natural causes, the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office said.

As one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll in the 1950s, Domino sold 65 million records - more than anyone in that period except Elvis Presley, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He had dozens of songs on the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts, including “Blueberry Hill,” “Ain’t That a Shame,” “Blue Monday,” “I‘m Walkin’,” “Whole Lotta Loving,” “Hello, Josephine,” “Walking to New Orleans,” “I‘m Gonna Be a Wheel Some Day” and “Let the Four Winds Blow.”

“For lack of a better way of putting it, he’s a living, walking legend among us in New Orleans,” singer Irma Thomas told the New York Times in 2007. “Between him and Louis Armstrong, they were the first big names to put us on the musical map.”

Antoine Dominique Domino was born on Feb. 26, 1928 in New Orleans and one of nine children. A brother-in-law taught him piano, leading to a style that mixed the classic New Orleans sound with blues, country and Cajun music. He was performing in nightclubs while still a teenager and soon teamed with trumpet player Dave Bartholomew, who would become his co-writer and producer and help refine his piano style.

His nickname was attributed to his short, squatty stature, as well as a tribute to two other pianists - Fats Waller and New Orleans native Fats Pichon.

Like contemporaries Little Richard and Chuck Berry, Domino was a black performer whose music crossed over to white audiences and helped shape early rock.

His first hit was an R&B song, the autobiographical “The Fat Man,” recorded in 1949 and considered among the first songs in the rock ‘n’ roll genre.

Also like Little Richard, one of his biggest hits, “Ain’t That a Shame,” was later recorded by Pat Boone, a white singer, whose version received more radio airplay. A live version of the song by the rock band Cheap Trick was a hit in 1978.

Domino would be a huge influence on rockers who came after him - John Lennon told a New York radio station that “Ain’t That a Shame” was the first song he learned to play - but his prominence began to wane after the British invasion and other forms of rock took root in the 1960s.

Harry Connick Jr., from a later generation of New Orleans musicians, said on Twitter, “You helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players... see you on top of that blueberry hill in the sky.” Guitarist Vernon Reid of the band Living Color mourned Domino’s death by tweeting, “Rock & Roll lost part of it’s soul.”

In his later years Domino was reluctant to perform and rarely left his beloved hometown, but he did go to Indianola, Mississippi, in 2015 to play “Amazing Grace” at B.B. King’s funeral.

Domino was a longtime resident of New Orleans’ Ninth Ward - the section of the city hit hardest by Katrina’s floodwaters - and had resisted early pleas to evacuate as the hurricane approached. For a time he was believed to have died in the flooding and the words “R.I.P. Fats You will be missed” were spray-painted on his house, which was flooded up to the roof.

It was later learned that Domino and his family had been rescued by boat and taken to the refugee center set up at the Superdome in the city before going to Baton Rouge. They lost most of their possessions in the flood but managed to save Domino’s couch, which was custom-made from the rear end of a vintage pink Cadillac.

After Katrina, he moved to a New Orleans suburb to live with his daughter.

The Recording Industry of America late gave Domino reproductions to replace the 20 gold record awards he lost. His Grammy Awards also were replaced and President George W. Bush visited Domino to give him a new National Medal of the Arts.

Domino titled his 2006 album “Alive and Kickin’” and proceeds went to help rebuild New Orleans and preserve its musical heritage.

Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get money out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, entered his plea in federal court in Boston.

Rocha, who pled guilty to conspiracy and money laundering charges, is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 7. While the charges each carry up to 20 years in prison, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 40-month term based on his cooperation.

The 28-year-old’s case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.

Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.

TelexFree collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.

Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced in March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, leaving behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts, prosecutors said.

In 2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, Wanzeler’s nephew, asked someone who became a cooperating witness to help transfer cash generated from the scheme that Wanzeler had hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, prosecutors said.

The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.

In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.

After a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex, prosecutors said.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

FILE PHOTO - The Qualcomm logo is seen on one of its buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., November 2, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for “immediate results” and “tangible agreements”.

But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate.

Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list.

Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved.

One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm, which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government’s review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend.

An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a “Section 301” U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.

”(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.

“Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,” he said.

Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk.

TESTY RELATIONSHIP

Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.

He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.

U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.

Calls for such a delegation during Trump’s visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation’s firms in China.

Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources.

Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump’s combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.

Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China’s trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late.

William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn’t expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.

“Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren’t going to start to respond until they feel some pain,” Zarit said. “We’re all wondering what that is going to mean.”

Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues “using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump‘s) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action”.

GAS EXPORTS

Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM), one of the world’s largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont.

Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra’s vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]

Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.

Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council.

Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy, and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment.

Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list.

At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department’s delegation but stressed that “we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump.”

TOUTING EXISTING DEALS

One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.

The risk is that commercial deals “distract from long-term political solutions” to trade issues, the official said.

Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama’s top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the “underlying systemic problems” such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.

“The Chinese will be happy to buy a lot of American goods. That’s what they know Trump wants – big export numbers,” he said, predicting that China would announce big business deals and allow the president to tout them during his visit.","Exclusive: Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-china/exclusive-energy-not-tech-or-finance-in-ceo-line-up-for-trumps-china-visit-idUSKBN1CW1GY

Under new guidelines for animal welfare, suppliers such as Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] must by 2024 meet new standards for the amount and brightness of light in chicken houses, provide access to perches that promote natural behavior among birds, and take other steps, according to McDonald‘s.

The fast-food chain said it will set targets for chickens’ health, including how well they walk and whether they have broken wings, and use third-party audits to ensure that farms comply. It will work with suppliers and technology companies to develop monitoring systems that automatically gather data on chickens’ behavior on farms.

Such requirements often raise costs for chicken producers because they must buy new equipment and retrofit chicken houses to comply. However, McDonald’s said it would not raise menu prices as a result.

Tyson and Cargill said they supported McDonald’s moves.

The requirements are the latest changes to affect McDonald’s menu that address consumers’ concerns about human and animal health. The company previously stopped buying chicken meat for U.S. restaurants from birds raised with antibiotics that are important to human health and said it would shift to using cage-free eggs in the U.S and Canada.

The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, where it gets most of its profit, after customers defected to fast-food rivals.

“While this might not be a direct impact on sales at McDonald‘s, it might help certain segments of our customer base make purchasing decisions that they might not have otherwise made,” Bruce Feinberg, a senior director for McDonald’s who works on meat products, said about the new standards.

Under the changes, McDonald’s also will buy chickens in the United States and Canada that have been rendered unconscious before slaughter with gas, instead of with electricity, a process some consider more humane.

The changes cover birds that account for more than 70 percent of McDonald’s global chicken supply, according to the company. It declined to reveal the number of chickens.

Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarter’s 2.9 percent pace. A measure of domestic demand also decelerated to a 2.2 percent growth rate from the April-June period’s 3.3 percent pace.

“This is a positive report for an economy that was battered by two hurricanes late in the quarter but it is not as strong as the headline 3.0 percent growth might suggest,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter. It was the first time since 2014 that it experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two quarters in a row. Economists had forecast GDP increasing at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter.

The government said while it was impossible to estimate the overall impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on third-quarter GDP, preliminary estimates showed that the back-to-back storms had caused losses of $121.0 billion in privately owned fixed assets and $10.4 billion in government-owned fixed assets.

Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, had no impact on third-quarter GDP growth as the islands are not included in the United States’ national accounts.

Post-hurricane labor market, retail sales and industrial production data already show an acceleration in underlying economic activity. Economists expect the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates for a third time this year in December.

“Fed officials will be encouraged by both the overall performance and the composition of growth in the third quarter, which confirms the U.S. economic expansion remains on solid ground,” said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

The dollar rose to a three-month high against a basket of currencies on the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest rate sensitive two-year note touching a fresh nine-year high. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.

The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue. The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term.

Though U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax reform, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies. Trump wants big tax cuts and fewer regulations to boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent.

INVENTORY BOOST

Businesses accumulated inventories at a $35.8 billion pace in the third quarter, leading to inventory investment adding 0.73 percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth. Inventories contributed just over a tenth of a percentage point to output in the prior period. Economists expect a modest boost from inventories in the fourth quarter.

Though export growth slowed in the last quarter, that was eclipsed by the steepest pace of decline in imports in three years, leaving a smaller trade deficit, which added four-tenths of a percentage point to GDP growth. Trade has contributed to output for three quarters in a row.

Business investment in equipment rose at an 8.6 percent rate, increasing for a fourth straight quarter. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, slowed to a 2.4 percent rate as hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt incomes.

Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter and is likely to accelerate in the fourth quarter with a separate report on Friday showing consumer sentiment holding at lofty levels in October.

Despite the moderation in consumer spending, inflation perked up in the third quarter, likely as a result of disruptions to the supply chain caused by the hurricanes.

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.3 percent rate. That followed a 0.9 percent pace of increase in the second quarter.

With inflation rising, income at the disposal of households increased at a 0.6 percent rate, braking sharply from the second-quarter’s strong 3.3 percent pace.

Investment in nonresidential structures fell at a 5.2 percent pace in the third quarter, the biggest drop in nearly two years, as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at only a 21.7 percent rate, a sharp deceleration from the second-quarter’s 116.3 percent pace.

Investment in homebuilding, which was already undermined by land and labor shortages, contracted for a second consecutive quarter. Government investment recorded its third straight quarterly decline

“While hurricane effects are hard to parse out of the GDP data, we anticipate rebuilding efforts will lift residential investment out of the doldrums it has occupied the last two quarters,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.","Inventories, trade shield U.S. economy from hurricane headwinds",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/inventories-trade-shield-u-s-economy-from-hurricane-headwinds-idUSKBN1CW0ER?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday.

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were “one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins” in the automaker’s North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company’s promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders.

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford’s new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects.

Ford’s share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV “in the sweet spot of the market” in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi’s U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi’s current lineup of SUVs “pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future,” Keogh said.

Renault SA (RENA.PA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become “a significant contributor to our performance.”

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

“I‘m sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future,” he said.","Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1CW0EZ-OCABS

The benchmark U.S. S&P500 index .SPX was up 0.8 percent late Friday, on track for it's biggest one day gain since Sept. 11 this year.

The Catalan parliament’s declaration of independence from Spain, made after a secret ballot, is now likely to be ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.41 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.56 percent to $1.1585.

Gains in the dollar were pared briefly after a Bloomberg report that said U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next U.S. central bank chairman. Powell is seen likely to maintain the Fed’s current monetary policy.

The pilot program aims to speed up the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles into the national airspace system and test drone detection and tracking while waiving some limits on their use.

Under a memorandum signed by Trump on Wednesday, states and local governments would be able to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval for testing and expanded use. The White House stopped short of proposing new regulations that would allow broader nationwide use of drones or any timetable for new authority.

White House adviser Michael Kratsios told reporters the “program will open the skies for delivery of life-saving medicines and commercial packages, inspections of critical infrastructure, support for emergency management operations.”

Kratsios said the program would allow companies and governments to operate drones in ways that are currently restricted by the FAA “including beyond-visual-line-of-sight flights, nighttime operations, and flights over people.”

Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc are among a growing number of companies hoping to make package delivery by drones a reality.

The memo said the Transportation Department could allow drone flights at up to 400 feet with the goal of approving at least five pilot projects. The program would expire in three years.

In 2016, the Obama administration opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use, but left in place significant restrictions.

The FAA estimates by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

In June, Trump told drone executives the administration wants “to create new companies and lots of jobs... We’re going to give you the competitive advantage that you need.”

In attendance were chief executives of drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and Precision Hawk Inc.

Drone manufacturers have argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does pre-approve self-driving vehicle technologies.

But security concerns remain.

In September, a civilian drone struck and damaged a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York.

This month, a drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport, the first time an unmanned flying object collided with commercial aircraft in Canada.

The FAA has banned drone flights over 133 U.S. military facilities and over 10 U.S. landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.

The memo said that the Transportation Department would coordinate with the Defense Department, Homeland Security and Justice Department to consider public safety and national security risks in approving pilot projects.

The Commercial Drone Alliance said it was “optimistic that the program will become a model for overcoming some of the hurdles keeping the full potential of commercial drones from being realized.”

Senator John Thune, a Republican, said the new policy “provides sensible direction that promotes drone safety, innovation, and local input.”",Trump administration program to test expanded drone use,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drones/trump-administration-program-to-test-expanded-drone-use-idUSKBN1CU2EA

FILE PHOTO: Akzo Nobel's logo is seen in Amsterdam, Netherlands, February 16, 2012. REUTERS/Robin van Lonkhuijsen/United Photos/File Photo

Akzo Nobel’s move indicates that its new CEO Thierry Vanlancker is continuing to look for big deals as a way to buttress the company, after it managed to fend off a takeover approach by PPG Industries (PPG.N) earlier this year.

Philadelphia-based Axalta is in the early stages of considering a deal with Akzo Nobel, and there is no certainty that the two companies will agree to a merger, one of the sources said on Friday.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Akzo Nobel and Axalta did not respond to requests for comment.

Shares in Axalta soared nearly 22 percent on the news and were last up 18 percent at $33.27 in early afternoon trading, giving the company a market capitalization of $8.1 billion. Akzo Nobel’s shares had finished flat in Amsterdam, valuing it at 19.5 billion euros.

Earlier this year, the Dutch maker of Dulux rejected a 26-billion euro acquisition offer from U.S. rival PPG. As an alternative transaction, Akzo Nobel has announced it plans to sell or spin off its specialty chemicals division, which represents about a third of sales and profits.

Such a divestiture will concentrate Akzo on coatings, and so a tie-up with Axalta, the No. 1 supplier to the North American heavy truck market, would round out its business to include vehicle coatings.

PPG CEO Michael McGarry said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call earlier this month that, when it came to Akzo Nobel, PPG had “moved on.” A PPG spokesman declined to comment on Friday on how the company will respond to Akzo Nobel’s merger discussions with Axalta.

A tie-up with Axalta, the former car paint unit of DuPont, is be the major first merger being pursued by Vanlancker, who took over as Akzo Nobel CEO when Ton Buechner resigned for health reasons in July.

Vanlancker has cut Buechner’s profit goals, made in the heat of the takeover battle, twice in the space of six weeks, blaming disruption caused by hurricane Harvey, rising raw materials costs and “headwinds” at its marine coatings business.

He has also focused on trying to cultivate Akzo Nobel’s investor base. Having won a court case in which activist investor Elliott Advisors sought but failed to get the removal of president Antony Burgmans, Akzo Nobel pledged to mend its relationship with shareholders.

Brazil awarded six of the eight blocks on offer in the auction for the rights to pump oil from the country’s coveted pre-salt region, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped below thousands of feet of salt in the country’s Atlantic waters.

The wins will bolster Shell’s position as the largest foreign operator in Brazil’s offshore oil sector, second only to state-run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) (PETR4.SA).

The Anglo-Dutch oil major won one area in consortium with France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), another with Petrobras and Repsol-Sinopec, and a third with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) and China’s CNOOC.

Shell has said it is confident it can pump from the pre-salt fields at below $40 a barrel.

Rival BP Plc (BP.L), which is active in Brazil but not yet producing oil, took two more blocks on Friday.

“We see the government of Brazil being more supportive of foreign companies entering Brazil,” BP Latin America President Felipe Arbelaez said after the rounds.

“There are high quality assets. We believe that the assets here will be resilient in any price environment.”

Brazil earned 6.15 billion reais ($1.88 billion) in signing bonuses for the six fields that it awarded in the auction.

President Michel Temer’s government has enacted reforms to make the energy sector more attractive to foreign investment, and for the first time international oil firms will be allowed to operate fields in the pre-salt.

Countries worldwide sitting on oil and gas reserves are keen to pump it before it becomes less valuable as global policies to address climate change kick in.

The opposition in Brazil has opposed some of the reforms, and the auction was delayed by three hours on Friday after a federal judge issued an injunction to suspend the process at the behest of the leftist Workers Party.

That left top executives from the world’s largest oil companies milling around in the hotel that hosted the auction, in an upscale seaside neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.

EXXON

In a twist, U.S. major Exxon Mobil, whose 10-block win in last month’s Brazilian auction was seen by many as a prelude to a big play on Friday, took just one block as part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil ASA (STL.OL) and Portugal’s Petrogal [PETP.UL], a unit of Galp Energia (GALP.LS). Two blocks got no bids.

The quality of reserves and the reforms have made Brazil an important target for oil majors, even though they have had less appetite for capital-intensive mega projects since crude prices crashed in 2014.

Brazil has high hopes for the volume of oil the companies can pump from the blocks. Brazilian oil output could double to more than 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, compared with the 2.6 million bpd produced in August, regulator ANP said on Thursday.

Thousands of protesters are expected in the eastern city of Dresden on Saturday when the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement celebrates its third anniversary.

PEGIDA - Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West - has seen dwindling crowds since early 2015, with the AfD absorbing some of its supporters.

The AfD won almost 13 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 national election, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the first far-right party to win seats in more than half a century.

Exit polls showed that 60 percent of AfD voters cast a “protest vote”, with many angry at Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to allow in over a million mainly Muslim migrants.

Experts say the party’s rise is also part of a global trend that has brought right-leaning parties or leaders to power in Poland, Hungary, and most recently, Austria.

Germany’s mainstream parties have said they will not work with the AfD at a national level, but activists say they must stake out clear resistance to AfD comments on Islam and other issues in the parliament, and 14 out of 16 state legislatures.

“We’ve seen a strong and growing movement of people resisting the AfD in recent months in big cities, in small towns, and now we need that movement on a national scale,” said Nora Berneis of Aufstehen gegen Rassismus, or Standing up against Racism.

The group is planning a large protest in the northern city of Hanover on Dec. 2 when the AfD meets for a party conference.

The party has drawn sharp criticism from a German journalists’ group for seeking data on the ethnic backgrounds and political views of journalists who want to cover the conference.

CIVIC EDUCATION

Christoph Schott, with the global activist group Avaaz, said more than 500,000 people had signed an open letter to the AfD, rejecting the party’s “xenophobic” and “racist” messages.

The AfD rails against what it calls the “Islamisation of Europe” and denies it is racist.

Beginning with Allied “re-education” efforts after World War Two, Germany has developed an intense civic education programme.

The government doubled funding for projects aimed at combating right-wing, left-wing and Islamist extremism to over 100 million euros in 2017 alone.

Some credit such policies with keeping support for far-right parties lower than in neighbouring countries.

But Axel Ruppert with the European Network against Racism said the AfD’s aggressive rhetoric was pressing the boundaries of “acceptable” discourse and hate crimes were rising.

Police data showed a 14-percent rise in right-wing extremist violent acts in 2016, and anti-Semitic crimes rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017.

The AfD’s entry into parliament has triggered a long-overdue dialogue about what went wrong during the unification of eastern and western Germany in 1990, said Michaela Glaser with the German Youth Institute, a non-profit research association.

That is the case with the $14 billion scrapped merger between Clariant and Huntsman, which would have combined two chemical makers with little overlap into what was effectively a conglomerate. Now that the merger is off, Clariant can consider other options. But there is a catch, in the form of the activist duo that killed the deal. Investors now need to know whether they are a catalyst, or an inhibitor.

White Tale, a shop-front for Keith Meister’s Corvex and fellow fund 40 North, bought a 20 percent stake in Clariant to convey its disapproval of the planned merger with U.S. peer Huntsman. Since a two-thirds majority vote was needed to approve the deal, and turnout at shareholder meetings is low, that was the end of that. The 6 percent drop in Clariant’s shares on Oct. 27, equivalent to around $500 million, compares with its $1.8 billion proportional share of the lump-sum value of estimated synergies. Investors had seen the writing on the wall.

Now comes the post-activist chill.

Moreover, Meister’s plan is unclear. While he has had successes pushing KFC owner Yum! Brands into a spin-off of its Chinese business, his track record is hardly that of, say, Nelson Peltz, the seasoned investor calling for a clean-up of consumer brands group P&G, or Meister’s own former boss, Carl Icahn.

Clariant boss Hariolf Kottmann has, he concedes, other options. The company could be a takeover target for a rival like Evonik. And splitting off its plastics and coatings business is an old idea that may still create value. The risk is that the triumphant activist will push too hard to realise rapid cost savings.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

By Paresh Dave and Arjun Panchadar

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected advertising sales and higher operating margins, boosting its shares as investors brushed off concerns about higher costs for acquiring mobile users.

The stock was up nearly 3 percent at $1,001.50 after the bell. They have gained 25 percent this year.

Third-quarter revenue for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped 24 percent to $27.8 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $27.2 billion. Profit of $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share, was well ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Alphabet, along with much of the tech sector, has enjoyed torrid growth in recent years as advertising moves from traditional media to the internet and consumers flock to an ever-expanding array of digital devices.

While Google faces political pressure, especially in Europe, over its growing dominance and its role in spreading propaganda online, those problems have yet to hit the bottom line.

Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that efforts to attract “both large and small advertisers” around the world were paying off, especially in Asia, where sales rose 29 percent to $4.2 billion.

The third quarter was the 15th in a row in which Alphabet has shown double-digit, year-over-year consolidated sales increases. The pace is not slowing down, with the growth rate reaching its highest level in nearly five years.

Ad sales at Google, Alphabet’s main operating unit, account for the vast majority of the company’s revenue. The ad business faces competition from Facebook Inc but has continued to grow as more users turn to Google’s YouTube and mobile search services.

Alphabet shares trade for almost 25.8 times expected earnings and Facebook at about 26.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Investors have been increasingly concerned about a sharp rise in costs for getting ads in front of users as Google pays Apple Inc and other companies to integrate Google search into mobile products and services.

The payments are included in traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and they rose 54 percent in the quarter, accounting for 12 percent of ad sales.

FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Pichai defended the partnerships in response to several analysts’ questions on Thursday, calling the deals “a win-win construct” because Google performs “better when our partners do well.”

“We’re pretty comfortable with how we’re approaching it,” he said.

Other analysts said revenue growth and cost controls made TAC increases less of an issue.

“There is way too much focus on TAC as a cost - it’s a great investment for Google to control the publishing ecosystem,” said Richard Kramer of Arete Research.

James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said: “TAC is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one.”

The third-quarter profit margin of 24 percent marked Alphabet’s highest since 27 percent in first quarter of 2013.

Google’s other revenue, which includes hardware such as the Pixel smartphones and Home speakers as well as the cloud computing business, also enjoyed solid growth. Sales from non-ad businesses rose 40 percent from a year ago to $3.4 billion in the quarter.

Among Google’s top priorities is expanding its salesforce to catch up with Amazon Web Services in providing corporate computing via large data centers, Pichai said. Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue, but Jefferies analysts estimate it at about 15 percent of Google’s other revenue.

Google also is trying to take on Apple in the high-end smartphone business with the Pixel. The company deepened its investment in September, agreeing to acquire 2,000 engineers from smartphone maker HTC Corp for $1.1 billion. Google’s Android operating system already powers most non-Apple smartphones.

But Google’s second-generation Pixel had a rough debut last week, with users complaining of a faulty screen and clicking noises during calls. The company responded on Thursday by doubling the warranty period for the smartphones to two years and promising to issue software fixes.

Losses from Alphabet’s Other Bets segment, which includes the Google Fiber broadband service and smart thermostat maker Nest, narrowed to $812 million from $861 million. The change reflected both an increase in sales across the companies and scaled back expansion plans for Fiber.

Google faces political uncertainty as European regulators crack down on its business practices and U.S. critics call for greater regulation of the tech industry.

The company recorded in the second quarter a $2.7 billion European Commission fine for unfair treatment of shopping websites in search results. Antitrust experts have said another fine could come by the end of year, as the EC investigates its distribution deals with smartphone vendors and wireless carriers.

Apparently alluding to political concerns about extremist propaganda and misinformation appearing on Google services, Pichai told analysts on Thursday that the company cared “deeply about the quality of information” it provides and would “constantly work to get this right.”",Alphabet's mobile ad revenue surges; shares jump,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-alphabet-results/alphabets-mobile-ad-revenue-surges-shares-jump-idUKKBN1CV3AP?il=0

Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants to raise the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix to 15 percent in the next few years from about 6.5 percent now.

“We hope to have 13-13.5 million tonnes in a phased manner in about five years,” G.K. Satish said.

Indian Oil Corp (IOC) currently holds rights to annually import 2.25 million tonnes of the super cooled fuel at Petronet LNG’s Dahej terminal in western Gujarat state.

The company is betting big on growing demand for natural gas for transport and manufacturing. It has a target to generate 15 percent of its revenues from its gas supply and distribution business by 2021.

IOC is adding capacity through its own upcoming LNG terminal and through stakes in other regasification plants.

It is in talks to buy about a 25 percent stake in the 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) Mundra LNG terminal, besides leasing 1 million tonnes of capacity at Swan Energy’s 5 mtpa facility at Jafrabad. Both of these plants are being built in the western state of Gujarat.

Western India is connected with pipelines and LNG import facilities, while industries in the east are still deprived of the cleaner fuel because of a lack of infrastructure.

To fill that gap, IOC is building a 5 mtpa LNG import terminal at Ennore on the eastern coast.

It has also booked 3 mtpa of capacity at Adani Enterprises’s 5 mtpa Dhamra LNG terminal and plans to lease about 0.5 mtpa of capacity at Petronet’s Kochi LNG plant in south India.

IOC, which has long-term agreement to import 0.7 million tonnes from the Cameron LNG Project in the United States, is scouting for more such deals. Supply from the Cameron project will begin by end of 2018, Satish said.

The company is also looking at a mix of long-term and LNG spot deals. “We have not finalised the ratio ... details are being worked out,” Satish said.

The private sector bank is still waiting for the final report of the central bank’s annual supervision exercise, Chief Executive Chanda Kochhar told reporters on a conference call, adding they will disclose the findings of this audit in the third quarter.

As part of this review, the central bank looks to see if banks have correctly classified loans, taking into account repayment trends and other factors.

A record $145 billion soured loans due to an economic slowdown and, in some cases, profligate lending has stifled new bank credit in India. But private sector banks have been able to gain market share from their dominant state-run rivals which account for bulk of the troubled loans.

But some of ICICI’s private sector rivals have disclosed additional bad loans following a central bank audit of their books for the last financial year.

A $32 billion recapitalisation for the state-run banks announced this week also risks curtailing the private-sector banks’ competitive advantage and their higher valuations.

Kochhar reiterated that the bank expected total bad loan additions in the current financial year to March to be lower than last year. She forecast domestic loan growth in the financial year to be about 15 percent, led by as much 20 percent rise in retail loans.

ICICI, among the three domestic banks considered “too big to fail” by the country’s central bank, reported a net profit of 20.58 billion rupees ($316.51 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analysts’ expectations of 24.91 billion rupees.

Non-interest income in the quarter included gains of 20.12 billion rupees from sale of stake in the initial public offering of unit ICICI Lombard General Insurance, ICICI said, lower than 56.82 billion rupees raked in from the stake sale in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance in the year ago quarter.

ICICI, which has the highest bad loans in absolute terms among private-sector lenders in the country, said its total provisions, including for loan losses, were 45.03 billion rupees in the September quarter, higher than 26.09 billion rupees three months ago, but 36 percent lower than a year ago.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans stood at 7.87 percent at end-September, versus 7.99 percent at end-June and 6.12 percent a year ago. Net interest income and fee income rose by 9 percent each in the quarter.

Although the Catalan declaration appears to be a doomed gesture, both sides’ moves take Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades to a new and possibly dangerous level.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for calm and said the rule of law would be restored in Catalonia, where secessionists have long cherished the dream of a separate nation.

A crowd of more than 2,000 independence supporters gathered in the Ciutadella Park outside the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting “Liberty” in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through.

The motion passed in the parliament after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of “President!” and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem “Els Segadors” (The Reapers).

“Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever”, Puigdemont said on Twitter.

But immediately after news of the vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil in the wealthy region.

Within an hour, the upper house of Spain’s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy’s government to rule Catalonia directly -- an unprecedented move in Spain since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.

The United States, Britain, France and Germany also swiftly dismissed the declaration and expressed support for Rajoy’s efforts to keep Spain united.

FIRING THE GOVERNMENT?

Rajoy’s cabinet was meeting on Friday evening to adopt the first measures to govern Catalonia. This could include firing the Barcelona government and assuming direct supervision of Catalan police forces.

“Exceptional measures should only be adopted when no other remedy is possible,” Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an address to the Senate on Friday morning.

“In my opinion there is no alternative. The only thing that can be done and should be done is to accept and comply with the law,” said Rajoy, who has staked out an uncompromising position.

How direct rule would work on the ground - including the reaction of civil servants and the police - is uncertain. Some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow “peaceful resistance”.

“Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,” Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.

“Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.”

The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. National flags now hang from many balconies in the capital in an expression of unity.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.

The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

NOT EASY

“It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be free, it is not going to change in a day. But there is no alternative to a process towards the Catalan Republic,” lawmaker Marta Rovira of the Junts pel Si pro-independence alliance said in a debate leading to the vote.

After the debate, lawmakers from members of three main national parties -- the People’s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos -- walked out. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favor in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them.

Spain’s constitutional court said it was reviewing the vote. The state prosecutor and other parties have three days to open a case.

Montserrat Rectoret, a 61-year-old historian, was among the crowds in Barcelona.

“I am emotional because Catalonia has struggled for 40 years to be independent and finally I can see it,” she said.","Catalonia declares independence from Spain, direct Madrid rule looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/spain-to-impose-direct-rule-in-catalonia-as-crisis-spirals-idUKKBN1CW0VB

Halep needed to beat an already-eliminated Elina Svitolina in her third and final round-robin match to reach the semi-finals of the elite eight-woman event, but a tense performance ended in a disappointing 6-3 6-4 loss to the Ukrainian on Friday.

“It’s a good feeling that it’s over because it’s been like a marathon the last months, with many things happening and also a bit of pressure,” Halep, who was thrashed by Caroline Wozniacki after beating Caroline Garcia earlier this week, told reporters.

”So, yeah, I think I played better than in the Wozniacki match (when she lost 6-0 6-2) and this was my goal, actually. I did everything I could and I wanted to win it, but just didn’t happen.

“Ich gehe davon aus, dass wir da hoffentlich innerhalb der nächsten Tage auch Vollzug melden können”, sagte der Generalbevollmächtigte von Air Berlin, Frank Kebekus, am Freitag im ZDF-Morgenmagazin. Dies könne dazu führen, “dass wir da möglicherweise weitere 1000 Arbeitsplätze anbieten können”. Am Abend stellt Air Berlin nach knapp 40 Jahren ihren Flugbetrieb ein. Die letzte Maschine mit eigener Air-Berlin-Flugnummer AB6210 startet um 21.35 Uhr in München und landet um 22.45 Uhr in Berlin-Tegel. Dort wird es für die Maschine voraussichtlich eine Wasserfontäne der Feuerwehr geben, wie es bei solchen Ereignissen üblich ist.

Air Berlin spricht derzeit mit dem britischen Billigflieger Easyjet und der Thomas Cook-Tochter Condor über den Kauf von Unternehmensteilen. Ein Konzernsprecher hatte von einem “Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen” gesprochen. Kebekus sagte dazu: “Wir verhandeln ja auch noch mit einem zweiten und dritten Interessenten.” Zuvor hatte sich die Airline bereits mit der Lufthansa über den Kauf von mehreren Unternehmensteilen geeinigt. Kebekus nahm die Lufthansa vor Kritik in Schutz, sie sichere sich nur attraktive Start- und Landerechte, kümmere sich aber nicht genug um die Beschäftigten. Der Generalbevollmächtigte betonte, die Kranich-Airline übernehme die Töchter Niki und LGW und damit auch 1700 Air-Berlin-Mitarbeiter. Zudem könnten sich Beschäftigte auf 1300 neue Stellen bei der Lufthansa-Tochter Eurowings bewerben.

“DIE 80 PROZENT SIND DER GRÖSSTE BESCHISS”

“Lufthansa hat sich hier engagiert. Mehr ist natürlich immer schöner”, sagte der Sanierungsexperte. Aber die Kritik an der Lufthansa könne er nicht nachvollziehen. Kebekus bekräftigte die Position der Konzernspitze, dass ein Großteil der ehemals 8000 Air-Berlin-Jobs gesichert sei. “Wir gehen nach wie vor davon aus, dass wir am Ende des Tages 70 bis 80 Prozent der Arbeitsplätze erhalten beziehungsweise neu überleiten können.”

Dies gilt bei Beobachtern jedoch als sehr unwahrscheinlich. Ein Betriebsratsvertreter hatte jüngst gesagt: “Die 80 Prozent sind der größte Beschiss.” Tausenden Mitarbeitern droht die Kündigung. Denn eine große Lösung für eine Transfergesellschaft über rund 50 Millionen Euro für etwa 4000 Mitarbeiter war gescheitert, da sich Bund und Länder nicht ausreichend an der Finanzierung beteiligen wollten. Für die rund 1200 Beschäftigten des Bodenpersonals soll es eine Auffanglösung gehen, die Air Berlin selbst und der Berliner Senat finanzieren wollen.

Air Berlin wurde 1978 gegründet und feierte am 28. April 1979 ihren Erstflug von Berlin nach Mallorca. Kritiker machen eine zu schnelle Expansion und ein verfehltes Geschäftsmodell für das Scheitern der Fluggesellschaft verantwortlich.

Pesquisadores da Escola de Medicina da Universidade Stanford desvendaram o laço entre a maconha e a frequência sexual em um estudo publicado nesta sexta-feira no periódico científico Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Cientistas da Califórnia chegaram a tais conclusões após uma análise retrospectiva de dados de 50 mil norte-americanos de 25 a 45 anos de idade compilados de 2002 a 2015 pela Pesquisa Nacional de Crescimento Familiar. Os Centros de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças do governo federal patrocinam o estudo.

Os entrevistados foram indagados quantas vezes tiveram relações heterossexuais nas quatro semanas anteriores e com que frequência fumaram maconha nos últimos 12 meses, explicaram os pesquisadores de Stanford em um comunicado à imprensa.

As mulheres que eram usuárias diárias da erva fizeram sexo em média 7,1 vezes nas quatro semanas anteriores, mais do que a média de 6 vezes daquelas que negaram ter usado maconha no ano anterior. Entre os homens, os usuários diários relataram 6,9 vezes, e os não-usuários 5,6.

“Em outras palavras, os usuários de maconha estão fazendo sexo cerca de 20 por cento a mais do que os abstêmios”, disse o principal autor do estudo, doutor Michael Eisenberg, professor-assistente de urologia de Stanford.

Dado que o casal típico faz sexo em média uma vez por semana, segundo Eisenberg, compartilhar um cachimbo ou cigarro pode proporcionar até 20 relações sexuais adicionais por ano.

“Acho que, se você perguntasse a um homem ou a uma mulher, fazer sexo 20 vezes mais ao longo de um ano pareceria muito”, disse Eisenberg.

Costumava-se pensar que os casais fumavam mais depois do sexo, mas Eisenberg disse que suas descobertas mostram que o oposto é verdadeiro para “todas as raças, níveis educacionais, grupos de renda e religiões, todas as condições de saúde, casados ou não e com filhos ou não”.

A maconha é legal para uso medicinal ou recreativo de adultos em 29 Estados norte-americanos e no Distrito de Columbia, disse Morgan Fox, porta-voz do Projeto de Políticas para a Maconha.

Hoje uma porcentagem recorde de norte-americanos – 64 por cento – acredita que o uso de drogas deveria ser legal para adultos, de acordo com uma pesquisa do instituto Gallup publicada nesta semana.

Kennedy but yielded to pressure from the FBI and CIA to block the release of other records to be reviewed further.

Congress had ordered in 1992 that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into Kennedy’s death should be fully opened to the public through the National Archives in 25 years, by Oct. 26, 2017, except for those the president authorized for further withholding.

Trump had confirmed on Saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once-classified records, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, “subject to the receipt of further information.”

But as the deadline neared, the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next 180 days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted.

The law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations, national defense, law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the public’s interest in full disclosure.

More than 2,800 uncensored documents were posted immediately to the National Archives website on Thursday evening - a staggering, disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators, scholars and conspiracy theorists.

The rest will be released “on a rolling basis,” with “redactions in only the rarest of circumstances,” by the end of the review on April 26, 2018, the White House said in a statement.

In a memo to government agency heads, Trump said the American people deserved as much access as possible to the records.

“Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” he wrote, adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now.

A Central Intelligence Agency spokesman told Reuters that every single one of approximately 18,000 remaining CIA records in the collection would ultimately be released, with just 1 percent of the material left redacted.

CIA Director Mike Pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the White House for keeping some materials secret, one senior administration official said.

While Kennedy was killed over half a century ago, the document file included material from investigations during the 1970s through the 1990s. Intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent “law enforcement equities” and other materials that still have relevance, the official said.

Trump was resistant but “acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months,” the official added.

QUELLING CONSPIRACY THEORIES?

Academics who have studied Kennedy’s slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the president’s open limousine that day in Dallas from an upper window of the Texas Book Depository building overlooking the motorcade route.

They likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old Democratic president’s killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.

Of the roughly 5 million pages of JFK assassination-related records held by the National Archives, 88 percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late 1990s, and 11 percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted. Only about 1 percent have remain withheld in full, according to the National Archives.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy’s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, although they retain a powerful cultural currency.

“My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin,” said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College. “It’s hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history. But that’s where the evidence is.”

Kennedy’s assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s. He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.","Trump releases some JFK files, blocks others under pressure",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-jfk-release/trump-releases-some-jfk-files-blocks-others-under-pressure-idUKKBN1CV3KM

Das teilte das Unternehmen am Donnerstag nach einer Sitzung des Aufsichtsrats in Eschborn bei Frankfurt mit. Kengeter werde das Unternehmen noch bis zum 31. Dezember führen. Zur Nachfolge des 50-jährigen ehemaligen Investmentbankers, der 2015 auf dem Chefsessel der Börse Platz genommen hatte, wurde zunächst nichts mitgeteilt. Die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die beim Wirtschaftsministerium in Wiesbaden angesiedelte hessische Börsenaufsicht erklärten nur Stunden nach Bekanntwerden des Rücktritts, dass sie die angekündigte Zuverlässigkeitsprüfung Kengeters nicht mehr vornehmen werden.

Zuletzt hatten Insider dem bisherigen Finanzchef Gregor Pottmeyer die besten Chancen eingeräumt, wenigstens für eine Übergangszeit. Aber auch andere Vorstandsmitglieder wurden genannt. Klaus Nieding von der Deutschen Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz (DSW) sagte zu Reuters, die Börse benötige nun einen nicht nur in der Branche gut vernetzten Chef, sondern einen Top-Manager, der auch intensive Beziehungen zur Landes- und Bundespolitik habe. Denn die Politik hat bei der Börse einen großen Einfluss. “Für die Deutsche Börse AG gilt es nach der britischen ”Brexit“-Entscheidung jetzt, die führende europäische Börse zu werden”, sagte Nieding.

An den Finanzmärkten wurde die Aussicht auf einen personellen Neuanfang mit Erleichterung aufgenommen. Die im Leitindex Dax notierte Börse-Aktie verteuerte sich um fast ein Prozent. Nach Handelsschluss werden auch noch die Quartalszahlen des Konzerns erwartet.

WIE GEHT ES WEITER?

Der Druck auf Kengeter war zuletzt massiv gestiegen: Die Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt hatte erst Anfang der Woche die Ermittlungen gegen ihn wieder aufgenommen, nachdem zuvor ein Deal mit der Justiz am Widerspruch des zuständigen Gerichts gescheitert war. Sowohl im Aufsichtsrat als auch bei großen Aktionären der Börse hatten sich zuletzt die Stimmen gemehrt, die eine Ablösung Kengeters forderten. Der durch die Affäre enstandene Imageschaden für die Börse sei zu groß.

Kengeter wird vorgeworfen, er habe Aktien der Deutschen Börse erworben, um von Kursgewinnen zu profitieren - als er bereits plante, die Londoner Börse LSE zu übernehmen. Dieses Vorhaben war später gescheitert. Kengeter beteuert bis heute seine Unschuld. Aufsichtsratschef Joachim Faber, der das umstrittene Aktienoptionsprogramm auf den Weg brachte, hatte sich lange hinter Kengeter gestellt. Allerdings war der Druck zuletzt auch auf Faber gestiegen - intern wie extern.

Der Deal mit der Staatsanwaltschaft sah die Einstellung des Verfahrens gegen eine Zahlung von 500.000 Euro durch Kengeter vor. Das Amtsgericht Frankfurt durchkreuzte die Pläne. Insider hatten daraufhin die Chanchen auf eine Verlängerung des Ende März 2018 auslaufenden Vertrages für den Manager als mehr oder weniger gleich null bezeichnet.

Doch selbst wenn der Deal geklappt hätte, wäre Kengeter noch nicht vom Haken gewesen. Denn die Finanzaufsicht BaFin und die hessische Börsenaufsicht in Wiesbaden wollten anschließend die Zuverlässigkeit Kengeters in zwei getrennten Verfahren unter die Lupe nehmen. Die beiden Aufsichtsbehörden teilten am Donnerstag mit, dass diese Untersuchungen nicht mehr erfolgen sollen, da sie ohnehin nicht bis Kengeters Abgang beendet worden wären. “Wir erwarten unabhängig davon, dass das Unternehmen weiterhin seinen Aufgaben als Träger der Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse in vollem Umfang nachkommen wird”, sagte ein Sprecher des hessischen Wirtschaftsministeriums.",Börsen-Chef Kengeter nimmt wegen Insider-Affäre seinen Hut,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-deutsche-b-rse-idDEKBN1CV28F

A Kurdish spokesman earlier said the two sides reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting which broke out on Oct. 16, after Iraqi forces seized the oil-city of Kirkuk.

Abadi ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept. 25 vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack.

The 24-hour truce “should allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas, including Fish-Khabur, and the international border”, Abadi said in a statement.

“This should prevent bloodshed between the children of the same country.”

He wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - call rejected by Baghdad.

According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region’s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 a.m. on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).

“The ceasefire is holding,” Vahal Ali, the director of KRG President Masoud Barzani’s media office, told Reuters.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also urged dialogue to start, in a call to Abadi, the Iraqi central government said in a statement on Friday morning.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

OIL REVENUE

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Kurdish Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds as the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur, and also south of their capital Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.

The spokesman of the U.S.-led anti Islamic State coalition in Baghdad, U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, told Reuters: “Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire.”

In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and “refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS”. “We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,” he added.

Iraqi forces on Thursday launched an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria.

Abadi has expressed hope the group will be completely defeated in Iraq before the end of the year.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

Islamic State’s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a gruelling battle which lasted nine months.

The militants’ Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces earlier this month.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed.

The dreams aren’t bitter. They’re charged with hope. It was this hope that led me to California to take part in clinical trials for a powered exoskeleton that is designed to help paralyzed people like me walk again.

I’ve been using a wheelchair for the past 21 years after one day in May 1996 during what was supposed to be an idyllic vacation on the Greek island of Poros.

One moment I was on a cliff cranking up a rented scooter, still shaking the salty Aegean water off my hair after a swim. The next moment I was on the rocky beach five meters below, on my back. I realized I couldn’t move my legs.

As much as I loathe that day, I know that I was lucky. That goofy plunge I took with the badly parked scooter could have killed me or left me completely paralyzed.

Instead, I fractured the 12th dorsal vertebra, right where the rib cage ends. That cost me the movement and feeling in my legs, except for some weak movement and dulled sensation in the upper thigh area.

My chances of recovery were little to none after the long hours my spinal cord remained compressed while I was taken by helicopter to Athens and moved between hospitals.

At 25, it sounded like a death sentence. Then I realized it was more of a life sentence – to lead a different life.

Now here I was in California’s Silicon Valley, thousands of miles from my home in Lisbon, wearing a walking, talking robotic suit called Phoenix, all titanium rods, aluminum-cased motors, wires, straps and protective padding.

When I took my first step, my wife, Liete, gave me a teary-eyed hug. I was too busy keeping my balance to celebrate. It took many more steps and several strenuous sessions before I started to enjoy seeing my wheelchair parked on the other side of the room as I trudged on – first in parallel bars, then with a walker and finally with crutches.

TO FETCH A BOOK

Relatives and friends have bombarded me for years with internet and social media links to the latest research into spinal injury.

It’s a mixed blessing because the research offers hope and yet at the same time shows how little progress there has been in practical terms, at least towards finding a cure.

Stem cell research to treat spinal cord injuries was the big topic 20 years ago. It still offers hope, but scientists say the effectiveness of the treatment is yet to be proven, and there are ethical and health concerns as well.

Experiments with implanted computer chips, sensors and electrodes that send signals from the brain to the muscles, bypassing the injured part of the spinal cord, have enabled some patients to regain some movement in their arms. But I don’t want electrodes in my brain.

Non-invasive systems like electrode caps that pick up brain waves and transform them into tiny electric shocks that make the muscles contract have so far proven too cumbersome.

Which brings me to exoskeletons. They do not claim to be the cure, but they can be a practical aid to making disabled people more mobile.

The original meaning of the word is a protective or supportive shell, like that of a shrimp. More recently it has come to mean an outer frame that not only supports, but also robotically simulates or enhances body movement. That makes paralyzed people the perfect target group.

The fact is, we need to be in an upright position regularly or we develop blood circulation and digestive tract problems. We start losing bone mass, which makes leg bones brittle. Our bodies become more susceptible to infections.

A standing frame, where padded straps for the knee, waist and sometimes upper body keep you upright, is usually the solution at home. My frame allows a bit of leg movement, but it is still a mostly static, bulky contraption, which makes standing a rather tedious chore that I tend to skip too often. I am 46 now and the older I get, the less I can afford to skip it for my health.

If I could walk about the house instead, fetch a book or get a breath of air on the patio, that would be a life changer, not to mention the possibility of doing the same in the office or on the street.

THAT ISN‘T ME

With time, and a lot of support from my family, friends and Reuters colleagues, I discovered you can get back in the saddle and regain independence.

Returning to work, first to a desk job in my native Moscow and then to reporting assignments in Latin America, was the most important step in that direction. At one point, I took the “back in the saddle” part so literally, I bought a thundering motorized tricycle which I rode with a bunch of Brazilian bikers.

I reported from slum riots and carnival parades in Rio and from tumultuous election rallies in Venezuela. I learned that even in the most chaotic situations, crowds tend to open a path for a wheelchair and strangers offer to help. I often ended up with a better vantage point than my colleagues.

Slowly, my body adapted. After battling bouts of depression, bladder infections and weight gain, I’ve taken up regular exercise in recent years and am now much fitter, generally in good health and have a moderately optimistic view of the future.

But walking remained off-limits. My leg muscles have largely atrophied, making my calves no thicker than my arms.

Not that I haven’t tried walking. Like many in my situation, I scoffed at the label “confined to a wheelchair,” seeking to prove to myself and others that it doesn’t apply to me. Just like “paralyzed from the waist down,” the expression is often technically wrong. To us, every millimeter of working muscle counts.

A couple of months after my injury I was already learning how to walk in a spinal injury rehab center in Aylesbury, England – on crutches and calipers or full-leg braces that prevent the knee from bending and stabilize the foot.

It was very hard work, especially on my arms and hands, and ultimately proved to be too much. I endured a couple of falls. Calipers just didn’t give me enough confidence to get up on my own or walk more than a few meters away from the exercise rails. The last time I used leg braces, along with a tailcoat and top hat, was on my wedding day in Brazil in 2002.

Over the years I’ve tried other walking aids. All required the assistance of a person called a “spotter” to help me stand. They gave me a very limited range and the speed of a tortoise.

All things considered, life was just easier and I was more independent in a wheelchair.

My home is easily accessible by wheelchair. I can fold it, put it in the car and drive wherever I like. Or I can just roll out onto the street for some air or a drink in a corner bar. Lisbon is not the most wheelchair-friendly place, but more and more buildings have ramps, lifts and adapted toilets.

FEAR OF FALLING

As I prepared for my journey to California in August, I tried to keep my hopes in check. I’d seen videos of paraplegics wearing robotic suits. They were all rather slow and in most cases required crutches for support. They were also generally prohibitively expensive.

Slideshow (28 Images)

If I could put this suit on unaided while in a wheelchair, stand up using crutches and walk around for an hour, that would be good enough for me, I told myself.

I was going to test an exoskeleton called Phoenix, which draws on technology developed at the University of California, Berkeley. The testing I signed up for is needed to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. SuitX, the company developing the Phoenix, says it will be the lightest and most affordable version on the market.

SuitX’s CEO, Homayoon Kazerooni, is a professor and director of the Robotics and Human Engineering Laboratory at the university. SuitX already makes industrial exoskeletons used, for instance, by airport baggage handlers.

Most exoskeletons have motors or hydraulics powering the hip and knee joints, but the Phoenix has only two motors at the hips, powered by a battery in a small backpack. Hinges keep your knees straight when your weight is on them and allow your lower leg to swing when you take a step.

Phoenix and I did not hit it off right away. In fact, had it just been a test drive and not the intensive two-week program I had signed up for, I probably would have decided that it was not for me.

As much as I had told myself not to expect miracles, I was all psyched up for one. I even came to California wearing a pair of old boots from the time when I could walk. “These boots are made for walking and that’s just what they’ll do,” I hummed the old Nancy Sinatra hit as I laced them up. For more good luck, my wife and I picked a local cafe called “Can’t Fail” to start the first day of tests with a hearty breakfast.

The first disappointment came during the fitting session, when my boots were discarded. I had to wear special shoes to fit the metal soles of the exoskeleton, as well as tight ankle braces to stabilize my debilitated joints.

Standing up was tumultuous, with the physiotherapist and two other employees helping me through the process, which still required a good push off the bars.

Then came my first step. I had been ready to repeat Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” phrase, half in jest, but it got stuck in my throat. I was gripped by a fear of falling. The device felt more wobbly than I imagined. The time it took to regain my balance and shift my weight forward for my next step seemed like an eternity. My knees were half-bent because my hamstrings had contracted so much from sitting for so many years. My hands hurt from nervously gripping the parallel bars.

I was unimpressed, demoralized even, so Liete took me for a scenic drive in the hills near Berkeley, and later we indulged in comfort shopping and some Napa Valley wines. It helped. I slept well and woke up rested and looking forward to getting inside the exo-suit again.

Then I met Steve Sanchez, who has been SuitX’s “chief pilot” for the past five years and uses the device regularly. The ease with which he stood up from his wheelchair and walked about revived my spirits.

It took me several more days to overcome my panic and feel more or less comfortable on my feet. I could stand up, walk and sit down with a spotter. A female voice from a speaker in the suit’s frame encouraged me to keep moving. “Left, right, left,” it said in time with my steps.

My hands no longer hurt as much. At night when I couldn’t sleep I would go over my moves - where I’d failed, what I’d done right - so my walking would be slightly better the next day. In our downtime, we visited San Francisco’s museums and galleries and met friends. Recounting my experience to them helped me figure out that I was actually enjoying the testing more than I thought.

My rookie mistake, I realized, was not trusting the machine and trying to compensate for what I thought were its shortcomings with my own bumbling efforts to support myself and move my legs. After almost two weeks of training, walking was still a lot of hard work, but I was getting faster and gaining endurance.

My health was better, too. A long-time sciatic pain was gone. I even managed to shake off a bad cold, which would normally have landed me in bed. To me, the improvements were tangible.

At the end of the program, the distance I covered during a set time interval had doubled since the mid-term test. I performed the theme from the classic movie about two Olympic runners, “Chariots of Fire,” as I approached the finishing line.

I‘m starting to put aside money for a Phoenix because walking is a practical goal, not just a dream anymore.

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s $999 price tag could weigh on demand.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

The $170 billion U.S. media firm was early and careful expanding beyond cable. Two examples are its purchase of NBC Universal - originally with its peacock logo - and a recently launched wireless phone service. Comcast stock has trounced the shares of Verizon Communications and AT&T. The company led by Brian Roberts has even pulled away from Walt Disney’s market value this year.

Thursday’s earnings report confirmed that Comcast lost 125,000 TV subscribers in the third quarter due to competition and hurricanes, something it warned about earlier.

That doesn’t detract much, though, from the longer-term picture. In 2004 Roberts, the chief executive, made a hostile lurch for Disney only to drop the bid. Comcast finally scored when it bought NBC Universal from General Electric in a two-part, $39 billion deal. The TV outfit’s former CEO, Bob Wright, groused in his book that GE, hobbled by the financial crisis, had given away the broadcaster for a song. He reckoned it was worth $45 billion.

AT&T has tried belatedly to follow. The telecom firm offered some $85 billion for HBO owner Time Warner in October last year and is still waiting for regulatory approval. It may have overpaid: Breakingviews calculated when the deal was announced that the expected $1 billion in cost savings won’t cover the hefty $20 billion premium.

Comcast is prudently moving into other areas as well. It launched a mobile service using Verizon’s infrastructure, avoiding acquiring a carrier like T-Mobile US. That may yet be an option, but for the moment it’s mostly upside for Comcast as it dips into the cellphone business.

Roberts has made mistakes. For one, he misjudged the political climate and had to drop a bid for Time Warner Cable, which Charter Communications scooped up. But investors have little to complain about. Since March 2013, when the NBC Universal deal was finally completed, Comcast’s total return, including dividends reinvested, of 96 percent beats the S&P 500 Index and Disney on around 80 percent each.

Investors wiped more than 10 percent, or slightly more than $9 billion, from the web giant’s market value in late U.S. trading on Thursday after it forecast disappointing sales for the rest of 2017. Baidu has cut costs and narrowed its focus to revitalise its search business. Unfortunately, that has yet to translate into less volatile results.

The search-engine operator said it expects revenue for the three months to December to be between 22.2 billion yuan and 23.4 billion yuan. At the midpoint, that’s a hefty 25 percent uplift on the same period a year earlier. But expectations matter, especially in growth industries, and this was about 8 percent less than what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting. Shares of the U.S.-listed Baidu duly tumbled.

The timing is awkward: Baidu’s main search unit has just started to recover after it was hit by a scandal last year over dubious medical advertising. Still, this looks like a one-off.

That is because the recent sale of an unprofitable food-delivery unit has depressed overall sales. But growth in its core business still looks strong. Helped by news feeds on its mobile app, advertising sales in the three months to September topped 20.1 billion yuan, up 22 percent from a year earlier.

Baidu is also more focused than it has been in years. After ill-judged forays into movie ticketing, delivering takeaways and other “online-to-offline” services, Baidu is shifting resources back to the search app. It is slashing other operating expenses, which is helping lift operating margins.

Yet investors remain jumpy. Before Thursday’s sell-off, shares of Baidu had rallied 59 percent this year. In absolute terms that is impressive, but that performance lags arch-rivals Tencent and Alibaba by 24 and 35 percentage points respectively. More predictability would help regain investors’ trust.",Breakingviews - China's Baidu stumbles in getting back to basics,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baidu-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-baidu-stumbles-in-getting-back-to-basics-idUSKBN1CW0AP

The results highlighted Exxon’s strength in refining as it managed to increase profits at its U.S. downstream operations despite Hurricane Harvey, which shuttered many of the company’s largest U.S. Gulf Coast refineries in late August.

Production of oil and gas also increased, even in the United States despite the storm, helped by higher pricing.

“A 50 percent increase in earnings through solid business performance and higher commodity prices is a step forward in our plan to grow profitability,” Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.

The Spanish football league’s president Javier Tebas was previously quoted as saying that, should Catalonia become independent, the region’s sides would not be able to compete in La Liga.

Valverde declined to comment on the possibility of that happening.

”Nothing has happened (in relation to Barcelona not being in La Liga) and we’re only talking about hypothetical situations,” he said.

“I have my own opinion but I just want to concentrate on sporting questions, especially because the political situation appears to change every half hour.”

In a bid to draw a line under Spain’s worst political crisis in 40 years, the government in Madrid on Friday sacked Catalonia’s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21.

In what appears to be a doomed gesture, the parliament had hours earlier declared independence following a referendum on secession that Spanish courts had ruled was illegal.

On the pitch, table-topping Barca confirmed that midfield playmaker Andres Iniesta would miss Saturday’s visit to Athletic Bilbao.

The club captain, who this week was named in the FIFPro Team of the Year, has a thigh strain and adds to a growing list of absentees for Valverde that also includes Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Arda Turan, Aleix Vidal and Thomas Vermaelen.

The news is not all negative, however, with full back Jordi Alba given the green light by the club’s medical staff to return to action.

The adults and teenagers of “Stranger Things 2” wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boy’s disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.

“We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so it’s about these characters confronting the horrors,” said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.

All nine episodes of “Stranger Things 2” will be released on Friday.

At the center of the show are its young teenage breakout stars. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.

Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the town’s police chief, Jim Hopper. Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.

“We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasn’t tied to the boys,” Matt Duffer said. “We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.”

“Stranger Things” has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc, landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.

Merkel is trying to unite her conservative alliance, which consists of her CDU and its Bavarian CSU sister party, in a pact with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats to form a government. The conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month.

After meeting for 11 hours on Thursday, the three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on the contentious issues of immigration and climate policy.

“Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees ‘yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations’,” said Manfred Weber, a senior member of the CSU who is involved in the talks.

“And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year,” he told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk, but added: “It will be very difficult.”

Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel’s decision to open Germany to more than a million mainly Middle Eastern migrants in 2015 and 2016.

Although the Catalan declaration appears to be a doomed gesture, both sides’ moves take Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades to a new and possibly dangerous level.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for calm and said the rule of law would be restored in Catalonia, where secessionists have long cherished the dream of a separate nation.

A crowd of more than 2,000 independence supporters gathered in the Ciutadella Park outside the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting “Liberty” in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through.

The motion passed in the parliament after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of “President!” and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem “Els Segadors” (The Reapers).

“Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever”, Puigdemont said on Twitter.

But immediately after news of the vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil in the wealthy region.

Within an hour, the upper house of Spain’s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy’s government to rule Catalonia directly -- an unprecedented move in Spain since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.

The United States, Britain, France and Germany also swiftly dismissed the declaration and expressed support for Rajoy’s efforts to keep Spain united.

FIRING THE GOVERNMENT?

Rajoy’s cabinet was meeting on Friday evening to adopt the first measures to govern Catalonia. This could include firing the Barcelona government and assuming direct supervision of Catalan police forces.

“Exceptional measures should only be adopted when no other remedy is possible,” Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an address to the Senate on Friday morning.

“In my opinion there is no alternative. The only thing that can be done and should be done is to accept and comply with the law,” said Rajoy, who has staked out an uncompromising position.

How direct rule would work on the ground - including the reaction of civil servants and the police - is uncertain. Some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow “peaceful resistance”.

“Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,” Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.

“Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.”

The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. National flags now hang from many balconies in the capital in an expression of unity.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.

The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

NOT EASY

“It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be free, it is not going to change in a day. But there is no alternative to a process towards the Catalan Republic,” lawmaker Marta Rovira of the Junts pel Si pro-independence alliance said in a debate leading to the vote.

After the debate, lawmakers from members of three main national parties -- the People’s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos -- walked out. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favor in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them.

Spain’s constitutional court said it was reviewing the vote. The state prosecutor and other parties have three days to open a case.

Montserrat Rectoret, a 61-year-old historian, was among the crowds in Barcelona.

O Ibovespa disparou 75 por cento desde o fim de 2015, superando facilmente o avanço de 40 por cento do índice de mercados emergentes do MSCI.

Esperanças de que o presidente Michel Temer seria bem-sucedido em acertar as contas públicas, além do forte apetite por ativos de mercados emergentes em todo o mundo, alimentaram a demanda por ações brasileiras.

O índice brasileiro atingiu novos recordes neste mês, mas ainda não atingiu os picos de 2008 quando cotado em dólar ou ajustado para a inflação.

Mas investidores que surfaram essa onda estão ficando mais cautelosos. Gestores como a GAP Asset Management e Kondor Invest, que administram um total de 5 bilhões de reais em ativos, recentemente advertiram em cartas a clientes que estão recorrendo a estratégias mais “seletivas” de investimento em ações.

“Como a valorização foi muito rápida, algumas ações com uma história mais limpa acabaram indo a preços um pouco exagerados”, disse à Reuters o gestor da Kondor Felipe Campos.

“Temos que ser cuidadosos ao escolher empresas que são de qualidade superior mas que também entregam resultados compatíveis com as expectativas do mercado”.

As declarações sugerem que os ganhos acionários podem desacelerar à medida que as eleições de 2018 se aproximam e ameaçam despejar volatilidade no mercado.

Muitos acreditam na possibilidade de mais um rali se o próximo presidente prometer dar continuidade à plataforma de reformas econômicas de Temer. Mas alguns apontam para sinais de que os preços das ações não encontram justificativa na atual conjuntura.

Cálculos da Reuters mostram que a relação entre preço e lucro esperado de dois terços das empresas do Ibovespa está acima da média de 2016, um sinal de que as projeções de lucro estão baixas demais ou os preços das ações estão altos demais.

A Rio Bravo Investimentos reduziu em setembro sua posição em Itaú Unibanco, o maior banco do Brasil, após a relação entre os preços da ação e o lucro esperado atingirem um recorde.

Esforços do banco para reduzir a inadimplência e elevar os spreads ajudaram a impulsionar seu lucro, alavancando sua ação em 35 por cento neste ano, mas essa tendência não deve se estender, disse a Rio Bravo.

“Optamos por realizar uma redução tática nesta posição - e aguardar (torcer) por um novo momento de relação preço x risco favorável ao aumento,” escreveram gestores da Rio Bravo em carta mensal.

Campos, da Kondor, citou a empresa de saneamento Copasa como uma escolha atrativa, com a possibilidade de pagamento de dividendos equivalentes a cerca de 8 por cento dos preços da ação.

A Copasa é vista como uma maneira de investir na recuperação econômica, mas apresentou desempenho inferior ao de outras ações semelhantes, como as de varejo e bens de consumo.

Os clientes dessas gestoras parecem apresentar a mesma tendência, embora costumem adotar mais cautela antes de fazer grandes mudanças em suas posições.

Dados da Anbima mostram que a captação líquida em fundos de ações referenciados caiu a 77 milhões de reais neste ano até setembro, contra 473 milhões de reais no mesmo período de 2016.

Fundos de índice com gestão ativa continuam apresentando resgates líquidos, mas eles desaceleraram dramaticamente a 94 milhões de reais, frente a 283 milhões de reais.",Investidores em ações ficam mais seletivos após ganhos recentes,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1CW2NV-OBRBS

Air Canada Flight AC781, an A320 originating in Montreal, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) on Sunday after receiving proper clearance only to learn that a subsequent message from air traffic control was not received by the crew, a spokeswoman for the airline said by email.

Air traffic control at SFO had instructed the Air Canada crew multiple times to execute a go-around because the controller was not certain that a preceding arrival would be completely clear of the runway before the jet was due to land, said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor.

“The Air Canada crew did not acknowledge any of the controller’s instructions,” Gregor said by email.

“Upon landing, the crew was informed the tower had attempted unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft, however, the message was not received by the crew,” Air Canada spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur wrote in a separate email.

The FAA was already investigating a separate incident from July after an Air Canada pilot lined up to land on a taxiway at SFO where four other planes were waiting to depart.

Gregor said a supervisor tried to alert Sunday’s flight by using a red light gun to alert the plane to go around, as is standard practice when an air crew is not responding to radio instructions. Instead, the flight landed, as previously authorized, on runway 28R at 9:26 p.m. PDT (0626 GMT).

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

The journalists - Lau Hon Meng from Singapore and Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia - were being questioned at a police station in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw after being detained in the morning, a local police officer told Reuters.

About 25 police staged an evening raid on the Yangon house of their Myanmar interpreter, well-known local reporter Aung Naing Soe, seizing his computer memory sticks and searching his documents.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled majority-Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown.

In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the death of the Rohingya in Myanmar constituted a “genocide” aimed at Muslim communities in the region.

Shwe Thaung, an officer from the Naypyitaw police station No.1, where the four were being detained, confirmed the basic facts of the incident but declined to elaborate, including on whether any charges had been filed, citing an ongoing investigation.

“We are still investigating and can’t say more than that,” Shwe Thaung said.

Myanmar state broadcaster MRTV said the journalists did not have permission to film the parliament with a drone. It showed their journalist visas and said the ministry of foreign affairs had informed the Singaporean and Malaysian embassies about the matter.

Turkish state broadcaster TRT could not immediately be reached for comment.

Several journalists in Myanmar have been arrested this year, leading rights groups to warn that the gains made in press freedom since the end of military rule risk being reversed under the rule of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Local journalist Aung Naing Soe has worked with many international media on the country’s transition to democracy after nearly five decades of military dictatorship.

His mother Thandar told Reuters police searched the house for computers and papers and asked for identification documents, and took Aung Naing Soe’s memory sticks. The police also tried but failed to open his computer, she said.

“I asked them to show me the search warrant. But the police said they didn’t need to do that because they were not searching for drugs,” Thandar said.

An administrator from Yangon’s Mingalar Taung Nyunt district, Ye Win Tun, who took part in the raid, confirmed that the police did not have a warrant but also said they did not need one.

“The search warrant would be necessary if they were searching for drugs or illegal card games, but in this instance it’s OK if the local administrator is there,” said Ye Win Tun.

He said the search lasted two hours and was carried out by the district police chief, township police officer, immigration officer, police special branch and several police officers, a total of about 25 people.",Myanmar detains reporters on assignment for Turkish state TV,https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-journalists/myanmar-detains-reporters-on-assignment-for-turkish-state-tv-idINKBN1CW2OX?il=0

The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances.

In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August.

According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China.

Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.”

“The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said.

Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.”

“As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.”

Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.

She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.”

“It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”

Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.",U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asia-quad/u-s-seeks-meeting-soon-to-revive-asia-pacific-quad-security-forum-idUSKBN1CW2O1?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Security Minister Ben Wallace said Britain believed “quite strongly” that the ransomware attack came from a foreign state.

""North Korea was the state that we believe was involved in this worldwide attack on our systems,"" he told BBC radio.

“We can be as sure as possible - I can’t obviously go into the detailed intelligence but it is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea had taken this role.”

WannaCry infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries in a matter of days, demanding victims pay ransoms starting at $300 to regain access to their machines.

Cyber security researchers quickly identified a possible link to North Korea.

More than a third of England’s 236 NHS trusts and an estimated 19,000 appointments were affected, Britain’s National Audit Office said on Friday in a report on the attack.

It said WannaCry was a relatively unsophisticated attack that could have been prevented by the NHS had it followed basic IT security best practice.

No NHS organization paid the ransom but the government does not know how much the disruption to services cost the NHS, it said.

Wallace said Britain needed to redouble its efforts to strengthen cyber security.

The adults and teenagers of “Stranger Things 2” wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boy’s disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.

“We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so it’s about these characters confronting the horrors,” said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.

All nine episodes of “Stranger Things 2” will be released on Friday.

At the centre of the show are its young teenage breakout stars. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.

Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the town’s police chief, Jim Hopper. Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.

“We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasn’t tied to the boys,” Matt Duffer said. “We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.”

“Stranger Things” has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.

The second season ramps up the quest to bring closure to her death while introducing new characters and expanding the story geographically.

The Duffers said they anticipate five seasons to bring “Stranger Things” to a conclusion.

“It was important to us this season to start to move out of Hawkins and to introduce this world,” said Ross Duffer.

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal with Flynn is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, said his clients were not under investigation.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Franks described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-woolsey-exclusive/exclusive-while-advising-trump-in-2016-ex-cia-chief-proposed-plan-to-discredit-turkish-cleric-idUSKBN1CV2RF?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

“We delivered strong growth this quarter with product sales up 7 percent to $3.5 billion despite a Cinryze supply shortage and a Lialda generic entry,” Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said in a statement.

Ornskov said Shire’s immunology drugs to treat diseases like Guillain-Barre syndrome performed strongly in the quarter and growth in the franchise it acquired by buying Baxalta last year rose from a historical rate of 6-8 to 21 percent year to date.

But a supply failure for Cinryze, which manages hereditary angioedema (HAE), had slowed progress, as had a 68 percent drop in Lialda sales after the July launch of a generic competitor.

Although Cinryze manufacturing had resumed and about $100 million of delayed product was shipped in October, Shire will start making the drug at its own facilities by the first quarter of 2018, which would secure supplies, Ornskov said.

However, the glitch had handed an advantage to rival CSL Behring, which has launched a competing product called Haegarda.

“We have seen some loss of new patients initially. But given strong patient loyalty (...) we do not see a major impact and we are very confident we will continue to maintain the majority of our patients,” Ornskov said.

A new HAE drug, which will be filed for approval in late 2017 or early 2018, bolstered his confidence in this area.

Shares in Shire were trading up 1.2 percent at 35.65 pounds ($46.62).

Analysts at Berenberg said Shire’s sales in the quarter were a “mixed bag that highlights the pushes and pulls in the product portfolio”, but the results showed its ability to deliver on cost control to drive earnings.

Ornskov said a decision on whether to spin off Spire’s neuroscience drugs, which analysts say could be worth up to $8.5 billion, would be made by year-end.

The franchise, which mainly addresses attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), achieved growth of 12 percent.

It successfully launched Mydayis in August and the once-daily ADHD drug had been prescribed to more than 11,000 patients by Oct. 17, he added.

Shire has reviewed its manufacturing portfolio after the Baxalta deal, and Ornskov said it had identified $100 million in annual savings from 2019.

Picture taken October 21, 2017. REUTERS/Maria Tsvetkova

The document, a death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus dated Oct. 4, 2017, does not say what the deceased was doing in Syria.

But Reuters has established in interviews with the families and friends of some of the deceased and officials in their hometowns that the dead included Russian private military contractors killed while fighting alongside the forces of Moscow’s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The presence of the Russian contractors in Syria - and the casualties they are sustaining - is denied by Moscow, which wants to portray its military intervention in Syria as a successful peace mission with minimal losses.

The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters. Requests for comment from the Russian consulate in Damascus did not elicit a response.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday: “We do not have information about individual citizens who visit Syria. With that, I consider this question dealt with.”

Reuters sent questions to a group of Russian private military contractors active in Syria through a person who knows their commanders, but did not receive a response.

The official death toll of military personnel in Syria this year is 16. A casualty figure significantly higher than that could tarnish President Vladimir Putin’s record five months before a presidential election which he is expected to contest.

A Reuters count of the number of Russian private contractors known to have been killed in Syria this year, based on interviews with relatives and friends of the dead and local officials in their hometowns, stands at 26.

Russian authorities have not publicly released any information this year about casualties among Russian civilians who may have been caught up in the fighting.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in response to Reuters questions, said the consulate in Syria was fulfilling its duties to register the deaths of Russian citizens. It said that under the law, personal data obtained in the process of registering the deaths was restricted and could not be publicly disclosed.

In August, Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said in response to a previous Reuters report that information about Russian military contractors in Syria was “a myth”, and that Reuters was attempting to discredit Moscow’s operation to restore peace in Syria.

UNUSUAL

A Russian diplomat who has worked in a consulate in another part of the world, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the figure of 131 registered deaths in nine months was unusually high given the estimated number of Russian expatriates in Syria.

Although there is no official data for the size of the community, data from Russian national elections shows there were only around 5,000 registered Russian voters in the country in 2012 and 2016.

“It is as if the diaspora is dying out,” he said.

High numbers of deaths are usually recorded by Russian consulates only in tourist destinations such as Thailand or Turkey, he said.

Russian consulates do not register the deaths of military personnel, according to an official at the consulate in Damascus who did not give his name.

The consular document seen by Reuters was a “certificate of death” issued to record the death of Sergei Poddubny, 36. It was one of three death certificates seen by Reuters.

Poddubny’s certificate, which bears the consulate’s stamp, lists the cause of death as “carbonization of the body” - in other words, he was burned.

It said he was killed on Sept. 28 in the town of Tiyas, Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting between Islamist rebels and pro-Assad forces. Several Russian contractors were killed in the area earlier this year, friends and relatives told Reuters.

Poddubny’s body was repatriated and buried in his home village in southern Russia about three weeks later. He had been in Syria as a private military contractor, one of his relatives and one of his friends told Reuters.

Poddubny’s death certificate had a serial number in the top right corner, 131.

Under a Justice Ministry procedure, all death certificates are numbered, starting from zero at the start of the year and going up by one digit for each new death recorded.

The Russian diplomat confirmed that is the procedure.

Reuters saw two other certificates, both issued on Feb. 3. The numbers - 9 and 13 - indicate certificates for at least five deaths were issued on that day. They were both private military contractors, according to people who know them.

The death of a Russian citizen would have to be registered at the consulate in order to repatriate the body back to Russia via civilian channels, according to the Russian diplomat.

A death certificate from the consulate would also help with bureaucracy back home relating to the dead person’s assets, the diplomat said.

The bodies of Russians fighting on the rebel side are not repatriated, according to a former Russian official who dealt with at least six cases of Russians killed in Syria and the relatives of four Russian Islamists killed there.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the July-September period, also supported by strong business spending on equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. With inventories, goods yet to be sold, contributing almost three-quarters of a percentage point to growth last quarter, the increase in GDP overstates the economy’s health.

Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarter’s 2.9 percent pace. A measure of domestic demand also decelerated to a 2.2 percent growth rate from the April-June period’s 3.3 percent pace.

“This is a positive report for an economy that was battered by two hurricanes late in the quarter but it is not as strong as the headline 3.0 percent growth might suggest,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter. It was the first time since 2014 that it experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two quarters in a row. Economists had forecast GDP increasing at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter.

The government said while it was impossible to estimate the overall impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on third-quarter GDP, preliminary estimates showed that the back-to-back storms had caused losses of $121.0 billion in privately owned fixed assets and $10.4 billion in government-owned fixed assets.

Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, had no impact on third-quarter GDP growth as the islands are not included in the United States’ national accounts.

Post-hurricane labor market, retail sales and industrial production data already show an acceleration in underlying economic activity. Economists expect the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates for a third time this year in December.

“Fed officials will be encouraged by both the overall performance and the composition of growth in the third quarter, which confirms the U.S. economic expansion remains on solid ground,” said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

The dollar rose to a three-month high against a basket of currencies on the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest rate sensitive two-year note touching a fresh nine-year high. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.

The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue. The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term.

Though U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax reform, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies. Trump wants big tax cuts and fewer regulations to boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent.

INVENTORY BOOST

Businesses accumulated inventories at a $35.8 billion pace in the third quarter, leading to inventory investment adding 0.73 percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth. Inventories contributed just over a tenth of a percentage point to output in the prior period. Economists expect a modest boost from inventories in the fourth quarter.

Though export growth slowed in the last quarter, that was eclipsed by the steepest pace of decline in imports in three years, leaving a smaller trade deficit, which added four-tenths of a percentage point to GDP growth. Trade has contributed to output for three quarters in a row.

Business investment in equipment rose at an 8.6 percent rate, increasing for a fourth straight quarter. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, slowed to a 2.4 percent rate as hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt incomes.

Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter and is likely to accelerate in the fourth quarter with a separate report on Friday showing consumer sentiment holding at lofty levels in October.

Despite the moderation in consumer spending, inflation perked up in the third quarter, likely as a result of disruptions to the supply chain caused by the hurricanes.

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.3 percent rate. That followed a 0.9 percent pace of increase in the second quarter.

With inflation rising, income at the disposal of households increased at a 0.6 percent rate, braking sharply from the second-quarter’s strong 3.3 percent pace.

Investment in nonresidential structures fell at a 5.2 percent pace in the third quarter, the biggest drop in nearly two years, as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at only a 21.7 percent rate, a sharp deceleration from the second-quarter’s 116.3 percent pace.

Investment in homebuilding, which was already undermined by land and labor shortages, contracted for a second consecutive quarter. Government investment recorded its third straight quarterly decline

“While hurricane effects are hard to parse out of the GDP data, we anticipate rebuilding efforts will lift residential investment out of the doldrums it has occupied the last two quarters,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.","Inventories, trade shield U.S. economy from hurricane headwinds",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/inventories-trade-shield-u-s-economy-from-hurricane-headwinds-idUSKBN1CW0ER

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA. Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there.

Thousands of protesters are expected in the eastern city of Dresden on Saturday when the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement celebrates its third anniversary.

PEGIDA - Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West - has seen dwindling crowds since early 2015, with the AfD absorbing some of its supporters.

The AfD won almost 13 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 national election, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the first far-right party to win seats in more than half a century.

Exit polls showed that 60 percent of AfD voters cast a “protest vote”, with many angry at Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to allow in over a million mainly Muslim migrants.

Experts say the party’s rise is also part of a global trend that has brought right-leaning parties or leaders to power in Poland, Hungary, and most recently, Austria.

Germany’s mainstream parties have said they will not work with the AfD at a national level, but activists say they must stake out clear resistance to AfD comments on Islam and other issues in the parliament, and 14 out of 16 state legislatures.

“We’ve seen a strong and growing movement of people resisting the AfD in recent months in big cities, in small towns, and now we need that movement on a national scale,” said Nora Berneis of Aufstehen gegen Rassismus, or Standing up against Racism.

The group is planning a large protest in the northern city of Hanover on Dec. 2 when the AfD meets for a party conference.

The party has drawn sharp criticism from a German journalists’ group for seeking data on the ethnic backgrounds and political views of journalists who want to cover the conference.

CIVIC EDUCATION

Christoph Schott, with the global activist group Avaaz, said more than 500,000 people had signed an open letter to the AfD, rejecting the party’s “xenophobic” and “racist” messages.

The AfD rails against what it calls the “Islamisation of Europe” and denies it is racist.

Beginning with Allied “re-education” efforts after World War Two, Germany has developed an intense civic education programme.

The government doubled funding for projects aimed at combating right-wing, left-wing and Islamist extremism to over 100 million euros in 2017 alone.

Some credit such policies with keeping support for far-right parties lower than in neighbouring countries.

But Axel Ruppert with the European Network against Racism said the AfD’s aggressive rhetoric was pressing the boundaries of “acceptable” discourse and hate crimes were rising.

Police data showed a 14-percent rise in right-wing extremist violent acts in 2016, and anti-Semitic crimes rose 4 percent to 681 in the first eight months of 2017.

The AfD’s entry into parliament has triggered a long-overdue dialogue about what went wrong during the unification of eastern and western Germany in 1990, said Michaela Glaser with the German Youth Institute, a non-profit research association.

His grieving family, now also under police protection, say they have little hope the shocking campus killing will prompt a re-examination of blasphemy laws that carry a death penalty, or action against the mob justice that often erupts in such cases.

On Friday, there was more evidence the opposite is happening.

A new political party that has made punishing blasphemers its main rallying cry won a surprisingly strong 7.6 percent of the vote in a by-election in Peshawar, 60 km (36 miles) from where Mashal Khan was killed six months ago.

“Death to blasphemers! Death to blasphemers!” was a common chant of supporters of the Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan party at its campaign rallies in the conservative northwestern city.

The party’s relatively strong showing - and a separate outcry over a proposed change to an election law that outraged the religious right - has elevated blasphemy into a potent political issue in the run-up to a general election in 2018.

While Tehrik-e-Labaik (Movement of the Prophet’s Followers) is unlikely to break out of single digits in coming votes, its rapid rise, along with another ultra-religious party, could create an additional challenge for the ruling Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

The PML-N party’s leader, Nawaz Sharif, was ousted as prime minister in July by the Supreme Court, and opposition leader Imran Khan - who spearheaded the legal case that removed him over unreported income - is seeking to press the advantage.

RELIGIOUS RIGHT GAINS

In this week’s Peshawar by-election, former cricket star Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party swept to a comfortable victory to retain the parliamentary seat, winning 34.8 percent of the vote.

Sharif’s PML-N had 18.9 percent, narrowly coming in third to the regionally strong Awami National Party that won just 40 more votes.

But the gains by the Labaik party - formed just last year - have grabbed attention.

Labaik draws most of its support from the Barelvi branch of Sunni Islam, the largest sect in Pakistan that is traditionally considered moderate. Though the party does not publicly talk about its funding, the Barelvis have a network of mosques and madrassa religious schools that collect donations.

The party emerged out of a protest movement against the state’s execution of Mumtaz Qadri, a bodyguard of the governor of Punjab province who gunned down his boss in 2011 over his call to reform Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, among the world’s harshest, to prevent abuses.

Qadri is considered a hero by the party, and its candidate in Peshawar, Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni, was equally supportive of Mashal Khan’s killers, although the student’s death was not a main feature at campaign rallies.

“It was state’s responsibility to punish a blasphemer, no two opinions, but when state doesn’t do its job and someone does kill, he shouldn’t be punished as a murderer,” Amini said, referring to the 57 people who face trial over Mashal Khan’s death.

In Pakistan, allegiance to Islam is the official line of most major parties, but ultra-religious parties have so far remained on the fringes.

Labaik is one of two new ultra-religious parties formed in roughly the past year.

Together, Labaik and the Milli Muslim League (MML) gained about 11 percent of the vote in last month’s by-election in Lahore and 10.4 percent in Peshawar, whereas the established religious parties, such as Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamaat Ulema-e-Islam, combined had 5.3 percent in the 2013 national election.

RULING PARTY UNDER FIRE

Blasphemy is such an effective wedge issue in Pakistan because there is almost no defense against an accusation.

For that reason, say critics, blasphemy laws are often invoked to settle personal scores and to intimidate liberal journalists, lawyers and politicians.

Dozens of Pakistanis are sitting on death row after being convicted of insulting Islam’s prophet, a specific charge that carries a mandatory death sentence, though no executions have been carried out in recent decades.

Now, political parties may be in danger of facing blasphemy accusations themselves.

Earlier in October, the PML-N found itself in the middle of a firestorm when it voted through seemingly small changes to the nation’s electoral law.

Iqbal Khan puts decorations on his son's grave in a family orchard in Swabi, Pakistan October 24, 2017. Picture taken October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Fayaz Aziz

The changes, among other things, turned a religious oath in the electoral laws stating that Mohammad was the last prophet of Muslims into a declaration using the words “I declare”.

The alterations prompted accusations of blasphemy from the religious right and the government quickly retreated, terming the change a “clerical” mistake and apologizing in parliament.

Labaik has vowed to hold a mass rally on Nov. 6 to demand the lawmakers responsible be prosecuted for blasphemy.

MOB KILLINGS

Even before the Labaik party’s political debut, politicians found promising swift action against blasphemers an easy way to appeal to conservative voters.

In March, then-prime minister Sharif issued a public order to prosecute anyone posting blasphemous content online.

The next month, Mashal Khan was accused of online blasphemy and beaten to death by fellow students and religious activists as onlookers filmed the scene. Sharif said he was “shocked and saddened” by the “senseless display of mob justice”.

At least 67 people have been killed over unproven blasphemy allegations since 1990, according human rights groups.

Mashal Khan’s father, Iqbal, said his son was the victim of false rumors.

The family has received death threats from right-wingers and Mashal’s sisters had to drop out of school.

“The snakes our country nurtured are now biting us,” the father said, two days before the Peshawar by-election, standing beside his son’s gave strewn with flowers, lace and poetry.

Learning of the Labaik party’s gains a few days later only made him more pessimistic about the government’s ability to stop abuse of blasphemy accusations.

Embora a declaração catalã pareça ser um gesto condenado ao fracasso, as medidas dos dois lados levam a pior crise política do país em quatro décadas a um patamar novo e possivelmente perigoso.

O primeiro-ministro espanhol, Mariano Rajoy, pediu calma e disse que o Estado de Direito será restaurado na Catalunha, onde secessionistas nutrem há tempos o sonho de uma nação separada.

Uma multidão de mais de 2 mil apoiadores da independência se reuniu no Parque Ciutadella, diante do Parlamento localizado em Barcelona, gritando “liberdade” em catalão e cantando canções tradicionais enquanto a votação da separação transcorria.

A moção foi aprovada pela legislatura depois de um debate apaixonado entre defensores e opositores da independência em que se decretou que a Catalunha constitui um Estado independente, soberano e social democrata.

O líder catalão, Carles Puigdemont, deixou a câmara aos gritos de “Presidente!”, e prefeitos que haviam chegado de áreas adjacentes brandiram seus bastões cerimoniais e cantaram o hino catalão “Os Ceifadores”.

“A Catalunha é e será uma terra de liberdade. Em tempos de dificuldade e em tempos de comemoração. Agora mais do que nunca”, tuitou Puigdemont.

Mas imediatamente após a notícia da votação, que três partidos de oposição boicotaram, as ações e títulos espanhóis começaram a ser descartados, refletindo o temor do mercado com o tumulto na região rica.

Em uma hora a câmara alta do Parlamento espanhol em Madri autorizou o governo de Rajoy a controlar a Catalunha diretamente – uma medida inédita na Espanha desde a volta da democracia no final dos anos 1970.

Em Bruxelas, o presidente do Conselho Europeu, Donald Tusk, disse que a votação de independência não mudou nada e que a União Europeia só lidará com o governo central.

Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, França e Alemanha também rejeitaram a declaração rapidamente e expressaram apoio aos esforços de Rajoy para manter a Espanha unida.

Seu gabinete estava se reunindo na noite local desta sexta-feira para adotar as primeiras medidas para governar a Catalunha, o que pode implicar em destituir o governo de Barcelona e assumir a supervisão direta das forças policiais catalãs.

“Medidas excepcionais só deveriam ser adotadas quando nenhum outro remédio é possível”, disse Rajoy no Senado na manhã desta sexta-feira.

“Em minha opinião, não há alternativa. A única coisa que pode ser feita é aceitar e cumprir a lei”, afirmou o premiê, que adotou uma postura inflexível contra a campanha independentista da Catalunha.

Mas como o controle direto funcionará na prática – incluindo a reação de servidores civis e da polícia – é incerto. Alguns apoiadores da independência prometeram montar uma campanha de desobediência civil.

“Não será fácil, não será de graça, não mudará em um dia. Mas não há alternativa a um processo rumo à República Catalã”, disse a parlamentar Marta Rovira, da aliança pró-independência Junts pel Si alliance, no debate que levou à votação.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement that after its initial review it “has not confirmed whether the contract prices are reasonable” under the agreement between Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and Whitefish Energy Holdings.

The $300 million contract between PREPA and Whitefish, a two-year old firm with just two full-time employees, was awarded without a competitive bidding process, according to media reports.

Meanwhile, a growing number of U.S. lawmakers were raising questions.

On Thursday, Representative Rob Bishop, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, set a Nov. 2 deadline for PREPA to provide information related to the contract.

On Friday, Representative Raul Grijalva, the senior Democrat on Bishop’s panel, and Representative Peter DeFazio, the ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, asked the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general to investigate how the contract was executed as well as its terms.

“We also request that you investigate whether there was any political impetus behind the contract,” Grijalva and DeFazio wrote to Inspector General John Roth.

They noted that Whitefish is headquartered in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s hometown and that Zinke’s son once worked for Whitefish. The letter also stated that a Whitefish financial backer, HBC Investments, “was founded by Mr. Joe Colonnetta, a major contributor to President Trump’s campaign, the Republican National Committee, and many other Republican candidates.”

A copy of the contract surfaced online Thursday night, raising more questions, particularly over language blocking oversight of costs and profits.

“In no event shall PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States or any other authorized representatives have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements,” according the document posted by a Daily Beast reporter.

Democratic staffers for the Natural Resources Committee separately confirmed the authenticity of the contract and prices under the contract published by Spanish-language media outlet Noticel, according to one of the aides.

Costs listed for hourly wages ranged in the hundreds of dollars and daily per diems of more than $330 for accommodations and nearly $80 for food, according to the “bid schedule” published by the outlet. The document put the cost of one-way airline flights for employees at $1,000.

A spokesman for Whitefish defended the deal and said the company welcomed an audit of its work.

“The contract was done in good faith with PREPA” and “speaks for itself,” Whitefish spokesman Ken Luce told MSNBC in an interview, adding: “There’s nothing there.”

Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rossello, has also defended the contract. Despite the contract language, however, Rossello had ordered an audit and has said he expects initial results to be released later on Friday, NBC News reported.

Representatives of PREPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA. Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

The ECB on Thursday extended its landmark bond-buying stimulus programme until at least September 2018, and said rates will remain at record lows until well after the scheme ends.

Investors appear to have all but ruled out the chance that any rate hike will come before the Italian leaves the ECB in October 2019, making him one of only a handful of major central bank chiefs not to lift rates in the modern era.

Even Ben Bernanke, the ultra-dovish former Federal Reserve Chairman who unleashed three QE programmes worth over $2 trillion in response to the 2008 crisis, raised rates. Not just once, but three times.

And with Britain battling rising inflation caused by a currency crash after its vote to leave the EU, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected next week to raise UK rates for the first time in a decade.

“This would be fairly unprecedented for a modern policymaker but at the same time the implementation and the reasons for quantitative easing (QE) in the euro zone are also unprecedented for modern monetary policy,” Rabobank strategist Matt Cairns said.

The majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the ECB to wait until 2019 before raising interest rates and only a handful of economists expect that to happen as early as next year.

The difference between overnight Eonia bank-to-bank rates and forward Eonia rates, as shown in the below chart, is a broader measure of investor expectations for upcoming hikes.

At the end of Draghi’s term in two year’s time, that difference is just 2 basis points, equating to a 20 percent chance of a 10 basis point rise in the ECB’s deposit rate - the minimum it is likely to hike.

A full 10 basis point hike is not priced until the middle of 2020, with further hikes roughly every year after that.

But Andrew Bosomworth of the world’s largest bond fund PIMCO said in keeping policy too loose, Draghi could leave his successor scrambling.

“It is incumbent on the President to set a path for tightening and to avoid a situation where Draghi does nothing and the next president has to get policy normalisation back on track,” he said.

The ECB last raised rates in 2011, under former President Jean-Claude Trichet, to pre-empt what turned out to be a phantom threat of inflation.

Among other major developed economies, a couple of Bank of Japan governors have refrained from raising rates as that country grappled with the threat of deflation over several decades; most notably Satoshi Sumita in the 1980s.

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending with its sales tactics, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was due to U.S. government pressure and that it planned to retaliate.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network. It cited a report this year from U.S. intelligence agencies and said it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have all recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

RT, an English-language news channel, accused Twitter’s sales staff of pressuring it to spend big on advertising in 2016 ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch. It said it never “pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. A former Twitter employee said the sales pitch to RT is similar to what the company uses to lure advertisers to Twitter, which has struggled to turn a profit.

On Thursday, Twitter said it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

HEARING

In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters’ faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials.

On Oct. 19, U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year’s election, introduced legislation to extend rules governing political advertising on broadcast television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.

General counsels for Twitter, Facebook and Google will testify on Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

“Twitter is wisely positioning itself to be able to tell the committees that the company has taken steps to address the issues raised,” Adam Sharp, a former Twitter executive, told Reuters on Thursday.

The Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a “gross violation” by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.

“Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the RIA news agency.

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.”

Some analysts said transparency, rather than a ban, would have been a better approach. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making the service more difficult to police.

“Banning any particular person, group or country is just bad policy - in other parts of the world, platforms will come to be viewed as a tool of U.S. or other foreign policy and it will give authoritarian regimes more excuses to ban speech,” Albert Gidari, who as a lawyer has represented tech companies, said in an email. Gidari is now privacy director at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society.

A U.S. lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, applauded Twitter’s move.

“Serving as a platform for free expression does not require assisting foreign powers in their efforts to push propaganda, whether by promoted tweets or other means,” Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.","Twitter bans ads from two Russian media outlets, cites election meddling",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-twitter/twitter-bans-ads-from-two-russian-media-outlets-cites-election-meddling-idUSKBN1CV2FG

The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances.

In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August.

According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China.

Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.”

“The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said.

Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.”

“As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.”

Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.

She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.”

“It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”

Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.",U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asia-quad/u-s-seeks-meeting-soon-to-revive-asia-pacific-quad-security-forum-idUSKBN1CW2O1

The mainly French-speaking province last week passed the law which does not specify which face coverings are prohibited but has largely focused debate on the niqab worn by some Muslim women, which covers everything but the eyes.

People affected by the law would include public-sector employees such as teachers, police officers, hospital and daycare workers and those dealing with them.

Quebec’s Justice Minister Stephanie Vallee said the province wants to ensure accurate identification and better communication and public safety.

Vallee said women would have to remove their veils when necessary for identification but not for the entirety of a transit ride or other public service. She said no-one would be denied emergency medical care, even if they refused to unveil.

“These are common-sense rules,” Vallee told reporters in Quebec City.

Vallee’s remarks come amid continuing protests against the law, including from Muslim groups and rights advocates. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government has no place dictating what women wear but stopped short of saying Ottawa would challenge the law.

Vallee said those who refused to uncover their faces for religious reasons can apply for accommodation on religious grounds, although it was not immediately clear what that would entail.

Right-wing extremist groups and some local French-speaking media in recent years have targeted Quebec’s Muslims as part of a broader debate on the accommodation of religious and cultural minorities in the province.

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA. Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there.

“Investigations are underway to determine the circumstances of this premeditated terrorist attack and arrest the group involved,” the ministry said in a statement on its website.

The incident was the latest in a series of attacks targeting policemen in the country where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based.

The government blames the attacks on Shi‘ite militants it says are backed by Iran to destabilize the country, a charge Tehran denies.

This month, a blast wounded five policemen on Budaiya road, near Manama, while they were guarding a procession by Shi‘ite Muslims marking the annual Ashura festival, which commemorates the death of Prophet Mohammad’s grandson Imam Hussein some 1400 years ago.","Bomb attack kills one Bahraini policeman, wounds eight",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bahrain-security-attacks/bomb-attack-kills-one-bahraini-policeman-wounds-eight-idUKKBN1CW2IW?il=0

The capital rules dubbed Solvency II were introduced in January last year after a decade in the making, costing insurers millions of pounds to implement and representing the single biggest regulatory task for the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).

Parliament’s Treasury Select Committee (TSC) report recommended several changes, saying it was concerned at the extent of disagreement between the PRA and industry over what can be changed by UK regulators, and what needs EU intervention.

“Such disagreements do not foster good policymaking,” the report said. “The Committee strongly encourage the insurance industry and the PRA to come to an understanding on what aspects of Solvency II can be changed unilaterally while the UK remains an EU member state.”

The lawmakers want a “roadmap” on what changes can be done by Britain and what must be left to the EU. It should include action post-Brexit to benefit consumers and the competitive standing of the British industry internationally.

“We will give the findings careful consideration and we look forward to providing a progress report as requested by the end of March 2018,” a PRA spokesman said.

The report noted industry concerns that the PRA is too focused on capital and not enough on allowing insurers to compete.

The overriding priority should be to develop regulation which is right for the UK insurance industry, the report said. “We would expect the UK regulators — with close input from the industry and HM Treasury — to work on this task.”

WELL BALANCED

The Association of British Insurers (ABI), which represents an industry whose members control assets worth some 1.9 trillion pounds, said insurers will be vital in helping the UK thrive after Brexit. “We can only do this if we have a well-balanced regulatory system with pragmatic implementation of the Solvency II regime,” ABI Director General Huw Evans said.

Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019 but is negotiating a transition period, during which it could still be subject to EU rules for two years or more, giving little room for going it alone with major changes in that time.

The report says the insurance sector should be treated as a priority in those negotiations to avoid cross-border insurance contracts being disrupted.

The PRA proposed tweaks this week, but they did not include easing the “risk margin”, a major bone of contention with insurers which the TSC report wants addressed urgently.

This refers to an add-on capital requirement to cover what a third party would need to safeguard policies if an insurer goes bust.

PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods has said he does not want to unilaterally change the margin, saying it should be left to an EU review, which could take time.

In the meantime, the lawmakers worry that UK business is being reinsured more cheaply overseas because of risk margin costs, and industry officials quoted in the report urge the PRA to take action now and not wait for any EU amendments.

“The Committee concurs and asks the PRA for an update on the best approach for improving the risk margin calibration,” the report said.

Os certames ofereceram oito áreas no polígono do pré-sal, das quais três foram arrematadas por consórcios com a Petrobras como operadora, que ofereceram os maiores ágios ao definir o percentual de excedente em óleo a ser direcionado ao governo no futuro.

Na área do Entorno de Sapinhoá, o consórcio liderado pela Petrobras ofereceu ágio de quase 675 por cento, o maior do certame, seguido pelos lances, também com participação da estatal, de ágio de 454 por cento em Peroba e quase 255 por cento em Alto de Cabo Frio Central.

O forte interesse pela área do Entorno de Sapinhoá, no pré-sal de Santos, explica-se porque está adjacente a Sapinhoá, um dos maiores campos produtores de petróleo do Brasil, já operado pela Petrobras.

“O que nós observamos é que havia grandes empresas globais, com alto grau de interesse, e nessa situação não poderíamos nos dar ao luxo de perder essas oportunidades, por isso fomos no valor que estávamos autorizados a pagar”, disse Parente a jornalistas ao final da disputa.

Ele ressaltou, no entanto, a associação da companhia com grandes empresas globais, como a anglo-holandesa Shell, a britânica BP, as chinesas CNODC e a Repsol Sinopec, que evidenciariam a atratividade dos negócios no certame.

“Ganhamos essas participações com parceiros... realmente empresas de primeira grandeza, o que atesta também o valor do ágio (oferecido nos lances)”, disse Parente. Segundo o executivo, os investimentos nas áreas vão gerar “retorno adequado” para os acionistas e não irão impactar o planejamento financeiro da companhia.

“Todos investimentos estão nos limites do plano estratégico e do planejamento financeiro da companhia, é uma questão de priorização”, disse.

An article in ESPN The Magazine, posted online on Friday, quoted Bob McNair as saying, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison” as he exhorted other team owners in a meeting to consider how the protests could hurt the league’s bottom line.

“I regret that I used that expression,” McNair, 79, said in a statement. “I never meant to offend anyone and I was not referring to our players. I used a figure of speech that was never intended to be taken literally.”

A number of players, mostly African-American, have knelt or raised fists during the “Star-Spangled Banner” to protest the treatment of minorities by police officers and racial inequality in the criminal justice system. Others have stood arm-in-arm in a show of solidarity.

President Donald Trump escalated the controversy in September, when he suggested owners should fire any “son of a bitch” who refused to stand for the anthem.

Trump has portrayed kneeling as an insult to the military and has kept up his attacks on Twitter, fueling further demonstrations from players.

The debate over the protests dominated a two-day meeting earlier this month in New York among league executives and team owners, where McNair is said to have made the comment. The league ultimately rejected Trump’s call for protesting players to be punished.

ESPN reported that NFL executive Troy Vincent, a former player, told the owners he was offended by McNair’s words, and that McNair apologized to him after the meeting.

McNair gave money to Trump’s presidential campaign last year, as did many other NFL owners.

The protests began in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, began sitting and later kneeling during the anthem to call attention to several high-profile shootings of unarmed black men in the United States.

Kaepernick was not signed by any team after becoming a free agent following the 2016 season. He has filed a claim of illegal collusion against the league’s owners.

A Seton Hall University poll on Friday found 47 percent of respondents believe the NFL should order players to stand during the anthem, while 42 percent do not.

Most people, by a 55-to-37 percent margin, also said it was inappropriate for Trump to launch a recent petition on the Republican National Committee website saying the players should stand.",Owner of NFL's Texans sorry for 'inmates' comment on protesting players,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CW2LA-OCASP

The 41-year-old professional golfer was found asleep in May behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz, which was parked alongside a road not far from his home on Jupiter Island.

Woods entered his plea and accepted the conditions, including 12 months of probation, by responding to questions from Florida Circuit Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo. He will now enter a diversion program offered in Palm Beach County for first-time DUI offenders.

Woods is eligible for the program since he had no prior criminal record, cooperated with police and was not involved in a crash, said Dave Aronberg, state attorney for the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida.

Woods has already completed 50 hours of community service as part of the program, said Aronberg.

“This particular plea agreement has no jail time,” Bosso-Pardo told Woods during the hearing. “However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and sentence you to jail for 90 days. Is that understood?”

Woods replied: “Yes.”

The hearing lasted only a few minutes. Woods, dressed in a charcoal gray suit and a gray T-shirt, did not answer questions shouted by reporters as he left the courthouse in Palm Beach Gardens and was driven away in a black SUV.

Woods told police officers at the time of his arrest that he was returning from Los Angeles, but could not remember where he was going, even though his car was headed away from his home, the arrest report showed.

Woods had five drugs in his system when he was arrested, but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report. Those drugs included generic forms of the painkillers Vicodin and Dilaudid; the mood drug Xanax; the sleeping pill Ambien, and a drug that contained THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

If Woods completes the program, the reckless driving charge will be expunged from his record. But if he is arrested again for DUI, he will be treated as a second-time offender, Aronberg said.

In a statement after his arrest, Woods apologized to fans and blamed the incident on prescription medication he was taking to manage pain from a recent back surgery.

Woods, who is second on the all-time list with 14 major men’s golf titles, has not won a major championship since 2008.

In 2009, he was involved in a bizarre early-morning car crash outside his home near Orlando.

They said they determined that a public health emergency declaration was most appropriate after an expansive review.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, stopping short of a national emergency declaration he promised months ago that would have freed up more federal money.

Responding to a growing problem, particularly in rural areas, Trump’s declaration will redirect federal resources and loosen regulations to combat opioid abuse, senior administration officials said.

But it does not result in more money to combat the crisis. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said the declaration was meaningless without additional funding.

Republican lawmakers called the president’s declaration an important step in combating the crisis.

“This epidemic is a national health emergency,” Trump, a Republican, said at the White House. “As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.”

Trump, who also called the epidemic a “national shame” and “human tragedy,” was introduced by his wife, Melania, who said she had made fighting the epidemic one of her top priorities as first lady. “This can happen to any of us,” she said.

The president also made a personal reference to addiction in his family by citing his deceased brother Fred, an alcoholic whose advice not to imbibe made an impression on Trump, who does not drink alcohol.

The announcement disappointed some advocates and experts in the addiction fight, who said it was inadequate to fight a scourge that played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death rate has kept rising, estimates show.

Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, are fueling the drug overdoses. More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC.

A White House commission on the drug crisis had urged Trump to declare a national emergency. On Wednesday, the president told Fox Business Network he would do so.

Officials told reporters on the conference call that Federal Emergency Management Agency funds that would have been released under a national emergency are already exhausted from recent storms that struck Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.

The administration would have to work with Congress to help provide additional funding to address drug abuse, they added. They said they determined that a public health emergency declaration was most appropriate after an expansive review.

Under Thursday’s declaration, treatment would be made more accessible for abusers of prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, while ensuring fewer delays in staffing the Department of Health and Human Services to help states grapple with the crisis.

‘BAD ACTORS’

Trump said he would discuss stopping the flow of fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Asia next month.

In his remarks, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service and Department of Homeland Security were “strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China.”

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had always paid a great deal of attention to international cooperation against narcotics and had listed 23 components of fentanyl as controlled substances, despite not having a fentanyl abuse problem.

Trump added he would consider bringing lawsuits against “bad actors” in the epidemic. Several states have sued opioid manufacturers for deceptive marketing. Congress is investigating the business practices of manufacturers.

The president also said the government should focus on teaching young people not to take drugs. “There is nothing desirable about drugs. They’re bad,” he said.

Thursday’s declaration allows the Department of Labor to issue grants to help dislocated workers affected by the crisis. HIV/AIDS health funding would also be prioritized for those who need substance abuse treatment, officials said.

As a candidate, Trump promised to address the crisis, including by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to stop the flow of illicit drugs, which he touched on in his speech.

Additional actions under the move would be announced in coming weeks by various agencies, officials said.",Trump declares opioids a U.S. public health emergency,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-opioids-emergency/trump-declares-opioids-a-u-s-public-health-emergency-idUSKBN1CV1XF?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Repeated delays to the poll, originally scheduled for late 2016, have led to unrest and raised fears the Central African nation could slip back to the wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley, who met with the Congolese electoral commission (CENI) during a visit to Kinshasa, told reporters she had passed on a message that “these elections must take place in 2018 or there will be no support for the electoral process”.

“The president must say that we’re going to have elections in 2018,” Haley said ahead of a later meeting with Kabila. “Every day we don’t have elections in this country someone dies.”

The electoral commission had said earlier this month that the vote to replace Kabila could not take place until April 2019 at the earliest, leading the opposition to warn that the population would “take matters into its own hands”.

Dozens died in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. The resulting political crisis has also contributed to rising militia violence in Congo’s east and center.

Kabila, who has ruled Congo since his father’s assassination in 2001, says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters.

However, his opponents accuse him of using the delay to maneuver to remove term limits that prevent him from standing for re-election, as presidents in neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done. He denies those charges.

Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said the government hoped to see the election as soon as possible but that it was up to the electoral commission to set the date.

“It’s not up to the government, nor to Ms. Haley to organize the elections,” Mende said. “I don’t think that we can be subjected to these kinds of diktats.”

International donors have said they are prepared to provide significant funding to elections but are waiting for a realistic calendar from CENI.

The two sides have held discussions, and talks are continuing ahead of a mid-December deadline to prepare proxy resolutions for next spring’s shareholder meeting, activists said.

An Exxon spokesman said it was meeting with investors but declined to discuss specifics.

A number of investors said they were looking for Exxon to give details such as those recently recommended by a climate task force of the Financial Stability Board. It suggested companies lay out the impact they would face from policies like carbon pricing plans, or how changes in supply and demand for resources like oil would affect their balance sheets.

“We’re hopeful that Exxon will take the opportunity to get in front of this and set new standards in terms of disclosure and transparency around climate change,” said Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research for asset manager Schroders, one of the filers of the resolution which has since spoken with Exxon executives.

Spokespeople for the Church of England and for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the lead sponsors of the May resolution, also confirmed they were in talks with Exxon.

“We have an active engagement process for environmental, social and governance matters,” said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri, who declined to comment on specific meetings with activists. Last year, the company interacted with shareholders that held 1.1 billion shares, including 40 percent of its institutional holders, he said.

In May, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said the world’s largest publicly-traded energy company would consider the issue after 62 percent of shares voted at the meeting supported a non-binding call for an annual climate-impact review.

Exxon faces several lawsuits, including from New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general, over the possibility it misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change. Exxon has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated.

Calls for companies to disclose more about how they will fare in a warming world received higher-than-usual levels of support at shareholder meetings this past spring, sometimes with new backing from asset managers like BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group.

Occidental Petroleum Corp, (OXY.N) said in a second quarter earnings presentation that it would provide additional disclosure of “climate-related risks and opportunities” after a majority of investors backed a call for such a report in May.

Also, this month refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the Financial Stability Board.

A shareholder measure calling for a climate-impact report received 41 percent support at Marathon’s annual meeting in April.

Some investor activists have a “wait and see” position on what Exxon may disclose. “It’s very unclear what Exxon is going to do” at this point, said Danielle Fugere, president of shareholder advocate As You Sow. She said the California group withdrew a resolution ahead of Exxon’s 2014 shareholder meeting calling for a climate risk analysis, only to be disappointed by the resulting document. On the other hand, were Exxon to do nothing this time around, its directors could face calls for their removal, Fugere said.","Exxon, investors huddle on climate data as proxy deadline looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-climate-report/exxon-investors-huddle-on-climate-data-as-proxy-deadline-looms-idUSKBN1CW2LZ

A four-storey house in a quiet alley of Marawi City in the southern Philippines was the secret lair of Isnilon Hapilon until late May. After a botched military raid to apprehend him, a thousand-strong rebel alliance held large parts of the city for five months.

Hapilon’s death in a military operation elsewhere in Marawi on Oct. 16 was the catalyst for the end of Philippines’ longest and most intense urban battle in recent history. [L4N1MY257]

Security forces moved in on the house on May 23, trying to capture the country’s most wanted man, but came under sustained attack from rebels firing rocket-propelled grenades.

A bomb-battered structure, shattered windows and wall-to-wall holes from machine gun fire tell the story of the ferocious three-day battle that erupted at Hapilon’s hideout, and prompted the call to hundreds of fighters to expedite the planned takeover of Marawi.

Hapilon escaped through a large hole that was blasted out of a rear wall, making his way across a rice field to a mosque next to the vast Lake Lanao. From there, he joined the guerrillas who held the heart of the city for the next five months.

Community volunteers on Thursday showed Reuters the house in the now empty, narrow street where the military believes Hapilon had lain low for several months. All other properties were intact and neighbors had fled long ago.

“At the time, no one knew who these people were, people saw them about but there was no reason to suspect anything,” said Mohammed Seddick Raki, who lived nearby.

Other volunteers said women and children stayed at the rented house and visitors were frequent.

Children‘s’ shoes were scattered amid the debris and a woman’s robe was hanging from a window.

Inside the house, black shirts, pants and plaid scarves synonymous with Islamic State were strewn across rooms littered with broken floor tiles and chunks of rock from blasted walls.

Left behind were waterproof boots, a balaclava, medical supplies and camouflage bags and waistcoats typically used by soldiers to carry rifle magazines.

Coated in a think layer of dust on floors of every room were pocket-sized copies of the Koran, some with pages stained by water leaked through gaping holes in the roof.

The deputy task force commander in Marawi, Colonel Romeo Brawner, said Hapilon evaded security forces because rebels had a network of lookouts and gunmen ready to defend him.

“They put up heavy resistance, they were spread across a large area. They were strategically placed,” he said. “They were prepared for it.”

Hapilon’s escape in the last week of May led to anarchy in the city of about 200,000. Rebels took hostages, set fire to buildings, ransacked churches, broke into the local jail to free inmates and looted an armory.

The government had insufficient security forces in Marawi to prevent the fighters from fanning out across the city and seizing hundreds of buildings.

Hapilon was wanted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and had a bounty on his head of up to $5 million. He was killed by army rangers in a night operation and his body was retrieved from the battle zone in the heart of the city and his identity confirmed by the FBI’s DNA analysis.

In five months of intense urban battle, the heart of Marawi was all but destroyed by government air strikes and shelling that leveled commercial areas and crushed thousands of shops, homes and vehicles.

“No one could have known what would happen,” said Mohamed Faisal Mama, a resident in the same Basak Malutlot district where Hapilon was hiding.

“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun.","ZURICH (Reuters) - A pick-up at UBS’s (UBSG.S) core wealth management business is likely to weaken in the final months of 2017 as clients withdraw money to take part in tax amnesty programs, the world’s biggest private bank said.

UBS, which manages more than more than $2 trillion of the world’s wealth, saw continued improvement in the third quarter at its flagship business after a sluggish 2016 in which trading activity by rich clients hit a record low.

But finance chief Kirt Gardner said the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slow three months, would be hit by an estimated 8 billion Swiss francs ($8 billion) in withdrawals as wealthy customers participate in government programs to declare offshore assets.

“We would expect that after the outflows in the fourth quarter you will see a drop-off in recurring revenue as a consequence and also reduction in margin,” he said in a call with analysts on Friday.

Gardner added UBS expected to see a recovery by the second quarter of 2018.

The bank, which also has investment banking, asset management, and Swiss retail and corporate divisions, said political and monetary policy uncertainty made it cautious too.

Third-quarter group net profit came in at 946 million francs, lagging the average forecast in a Reuters survey of six analysts but ahead of the Swiss bank’s own poll.

UBS shares were down 1.1 percent at 1120 GMT, a steeper drop than the European banking sector index .SX7P.

‘EXPECTING A LOT’

Net new money inflows - a closely watched indicator of future earnings in money management - totaled 4.6 billion francs at UBS’s international wealth management unit in the third quarter.

A bright spot for the unit was the contribution from Asia Pacific, a priority growth region for UBS which has seen its best ever year-to-date performance.

UBS’s North America brokerage business, which handles just over half the bank’s wealth management assets, saw net outflows of $2.3 billion, a blow to a business investors hope is on an upward curve.

“The market is expecting a lot from wealth management Americas because of the good economy and the rate increases,” said Mirabaud Securities Limited analyst Andreas Brun, who rates UBS’s stock “buy”.

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.

UBS’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, an important measure of balance sheet strength which UBS uses to help decide its dividend, rose to 13.7 percent from 13.5 percent in the second quarter. A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.

However, Brun said pending legal cases and the uncertainty over future capital rules under Basel IV regulations meant it was too soon to draw conclusions for the dividend.

“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun. “For me it’s still too early to call it a dividend story.”",UBS cautions gains from wealthy client activity may not last,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-group-ag-results/ubs-cautions-gains-from-wealthy-client-activity-may-not-last-idUSKBN1CW0QC?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Instead, the struggle will, as it did during the fight against the Sunni extremists of Islamic State, involve shifting Sunni and Shi’ite allegiances.

For the moment, there seems to be an easing in the historic tensions between the two main – and often warring – branches of Islam. Religious differences are not the focus; this is a classic geopolitical power struggle for control of Iraq, Syria, and Kurdistan, and for expanding diplomatic and strategic reach throughout the region.

Iran is lined up to be the big winner in Syria. Islamic State's defeat will significantly lessen Sunni influence, and Tehran’s role as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's protector will only increase now that it appears Assad will remain in control of some portion of the country. Iran will have pieced together a land corridor to the Mediterranean. The Saudis will be left with little influence.

The same goes for the United States. American forces have been largely relegated to playing traffic cop among various on-again off-again allies such as the Turks and Kurds, each with its own agenda in Syria. Any influence Washington thinks it still has is further diluted by the presence of the Russians, who are there to support Assad while maintaining a permanent presence in the heart of the Middle East. American efforts may wind up as little more than fumbling around to keep Israel and Jordan from overreacting to the increased Iranian influence on their borders.

In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Riyadh appears to be pivoting towards warmer relations with the Shi’ite government in Baghdad. That a Saudi airline is announcing the first return of direct service between the two countries since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 is no coincidence, nor is it an isolated event.

The Saudis also appear ready to take advantage of a looming intra-Shi’ite power struggle in Baghdad among Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, the most religiously zealous of the group, has always been something of a nationalist and is wary of Iranian influence. It is thus not surprising he made friendly trips under official invitation to Sunni Riyadh, and the United Arab Emirates, in recent months.

Sadr is an interesting choice for the Saudis to use to gain influence in Baghdad. Real progress for Riyadh means untangling years of close Iranian cooperation in Iraq, to include limiting the power of the Iranian-backed militias. Sadr has significant influence in that respect, and can use his popularity and credibility to sell Saudi cooperation to his followers who remember Saudi funding of al Qaeda in Iraq and Islamic State over the years. Enhancing Sadr's Shi’ite religious status can further Sunni Saudi goals. During his visit, the Saudis gifted Sadr with $10 million for “rebuilding,” and also astutely threw in some visas for this year’s Hajj pilgrimage for Sadr to distribute.

The Saudis otherwise have little to work with in Iraq compared to Iran. Tehran’s ties to officials in Baghdad are just a tiny part of a deep relationship forged in the bloody fight against the American occupiers and the ousting of Islamic State. Iranian money continues to support Iraq, and the Shi’ite militias are still mostly under Iranian influence.

Iran is also probably the most stable Muslim nation in the Middle East. It has existed more or less within its current borders for thousands of years, and is largely religiously, culturally, and linguistically homogeneous (though keep an eye on the Kurdish minority.) While governed in significant part by its clerics, the country has held a series of increasingly democratic elections. And unlike the Saudi monarchs, Iran’s leaders do not rule in fear of an Islamic revolution. They already had one.

Power struggles create flashpoints, and the Saudi-Iranian fight post-Islamic State is no exception. The Saudi-Iranian proxy war in Yemen has settled into a version of World War One-style trench warfare, with neither side strong enough to win nor weak enough to lose. In an ugly form of stasis, the conflict seems likely to stay within its present borders.

The powder keg is Kurdistan. Though arguably a de facto state since 2003, after the Kurds voted formally voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, Iran and the Iranian-backed government in Baghdad were pressed to make clear they will not tolerate an actual Kurdish nation. With Islamic State nearly defeated and combat-tested Shi’ite militias ready for their next tasks, Tehran and Baghdad no longer need to keep the Kurds on their side. Fighting has already broken out around Kirkuk, an oil-rich city in Iraqi Kurdistan, between forces supported by Baghdad/Tehran and Kurdish fighters – leaving a gap for the Saudis to offer financial or covert support to the Iraqi Kurds.

Saudi involvement could morph an Iraqi civil war into a new proxy struggle right on Iran’s own western border, with the possible complication of further unrest inside Iran by its Kurdish minority.

Seyed Hossein Mousavian: What Trump needs to know about Iran

While it may seem odd to write about the changing balance of power in the Middle East largely leaving out the United States, that may well describe America’s range of options post-Islamic State.

Washington’s influence in Baghdad is limited and relations with Iran are in shambles under the Trump administration. It is highly unlikely America will join Iran to fight against Kurdish allies who helped defeat Islamic State. Nor are American troops likely to battle Iranian-led militias in support of Kurdish independence that Washington says it doesn’t really support right now.

That leaves the United States sidelined, with few options other than perhaps supporting the Saudis from afar in whatever anti-Iranian meddling they do in Iraq.

Maruti Suzuki’s chairman said there was still no clear roadmap on how the government aimed to achieve its target and a lot would depend on that.

“We will make electric cars but I can’t give you the date just now because it is all very much a work in progress,” R.C. Bhargava told reporters, after the company posted a 3 percent rise in quarterly profit, beating analysts’ estimates.

India is working on a new auto policy that promotes the use of electric cars, and a draft is likely to be made public before the end of the year. This is a shift from an earlier policy that promoted hybrid and electric vehicles.

Sales of electric cars in India remain negligible, however, mainly due to the high cost of batteries which make the vehicles expensive and out of reach for many buyers in a country where cars are as cheap as 250,000 rupees ($3,800). A lack of charging stations also makes the whole proposition unviable for now.

Maruti’s parent, Suzuki Motor Corp, has electric car technology which it can provide, Bhargava said, adding the Japanese company was also in talks with Toyota Motor Corp to form an alliance which may include sharing technologies like hybrid and electric.

Maruti dominates the small car market in India and has been launching more premium vehicles as competition heats up with newer and planned entrants such as Kia Motors and SAIC Motor Corp.

Maruti also manufactures hybrid cars, demand for which has taken a beating after the government raised sales taxes on them to as much as 43 percent. Bhargava said the future of hybrid cars in India would depend on the level of taxes and the company was in talks with the government to lower them.

GROWTH SLOWING

Bhargava said that while the company continued to expect double digit sales growth over the remainder of fiscal 2018, it would slow from the 18 percent posted in the second quarter.

Earlier on Friday, Maruti reported a profit of 24.84 billion rupees ($381.86 million) for the second quarter ended Sept. 30, versus 24.02 billion rupees a year ago, helped by higher sales of compact and utility vehicles. (bit.ly/2xtLHZZ)

Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 22.29 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Maruti, which provides the bulk of Suzuki Motor’s revenues, sold a total of 492,118 vehicles during the quarter, up about 18 percent from a year ago.

Sales of compact vehicles, which include the Swift and Baleno, rose 43.5 percent, while sales of utility vehicles like the Ertiga and Vitara Brezza climbed 27.6 percent.

FILE PHOTO - The Qualcomm logo is seen on one of its buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., November 2, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for “immediate results” and “tangible agreements”.

But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate.

Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list.

Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved.

One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm, which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government’s review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend.

An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a “Section 301” U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.

”(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.

“Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,” he said.

Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk.

TESTY RELATIONSHIP

Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.

He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.

U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.

Calls for such a delegation during Trump’s visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation’s firms in China.

Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources.

Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump’s combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.

Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China’s trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late.

William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn’t expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.

“Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren’t going to start to respond until they feel some pain,” Zarit said. “We’re all wondering what that is going to mean.”

Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues “using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump‘s) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action”.

GAS EXPORTS

Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM), one of the world’s largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont.

Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra’s vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]

Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.

Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council.

Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy, and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment.

Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list.

At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department’s delegation but stressed that “we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump.”

TOUTING EXISTING DEALS

One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.

The risk is that commercial deals “distract from long-term political solutions” to trade issues, the official said.

Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama’s top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the “underlying systemic problems” such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.

“The Chinese will be happy to buy a lot of American goods. That’s what they know Trump wants – big export numbers,” he said, predicting that China would announce big business deals and allow the president to tout them during his visit.","Exclusive: Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia-china/exclusive-energy-not-tech-or-finance-in-ceo-line-up-for-trumps-china-visit-idUSKBN1CW1GY

The document, a death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus dated Oct. 4, 2017, does not say what the deceased was doing in Syria.

But Reuters has established in interviews with the families and friends of some of the deceased and officials in their hometowns that the dead included Russian private military contractors killed while fighting alongside the forces of Moscow’s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The presence of the Russian contractors in Syria - and the casualties they are sustaining - is denied by Moscow, which wants to portray its military intervention in Syria as a successful peace mission with minimal losses.

The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters. Requests for comment from the Russian consulate in Damascus did not elicit a response.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday: “We do not have information about individual citizens who visit Syria. With that, I consider this question dealt with.”

Reuters sent questions to a group of Russian private military contractors active in Syria through a person who knows their commanders, but did not receive a response.

The official death toll of military personnel in Syria this year is 16. A casualty figure significantly higher than that could tarnish President Vladimir Putin’s record five months before a presidential election which he is expected to contest.

A Reuters count of the number of Russian private contractors known to have been killed in Syria this year, based on interviews with relatives and friends of the dead and local officials in their hometowns, stands at 26.

Russian authorities have not publicly released any information this year about casualties among Russian civilians who may have been caught up in the fighting.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in response to Reuters questions, said the consulate in Syria was fulfilling its duties to register the deaths of Russian citizens. It said that under the law, personal data obtained in the process of registering the deaths was restricted and could not be publicly disclosed.

In August, Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said in response to a previous Reuters report that information about Russian military contractors in Syria was “a myth”, and that Reuters was attempting to discredit Moscow’s operation to restore peace in Syria.

UNUSUAL

A Russian diplomat who has worked in a consulate in another part of the world, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the figure of 131 registered deaths in nine months was unusually high given the estimated number of Russian expatriates in Syria.

Although there is no official data for the size of the community, data from Russian national elections shows there were only around 5,000 registered Russian voters in the country in 2012 and 2016.

“It is as if the diaspora is dying out,” he said.

High numbers of deaths are usually recorded by Russian consulates only in tourist destinations such as Thailand or Turkey, he said.

Russian consulates do not register the deaths of military personnel, according to an official at the consulate in Damascus who did not give his name.

The consular document seen by Reuters was a “certificate of death” issued to record the death of Sergei Poddubny, 36. It was one of three death certificates seen by Reuters.

Poddubny’s certificate, which bears the consulate’s stamp, lists the cause of death as “carbonization of the body” - in other words, he was burned.

It said he was killed on Sept. 28 in the town of Tiyas, Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting between Islamist rebels and pro-Assad forces. Several Russian contractors were killed in the area earlier this year, friends and relatives told Reuters.

Poddubny’s body was repatriated and buried in his home village in southern Russia about three weeks later. He had been in Syria as a private military contractor, one of his relatives and one of his friends told Reuters.

Poddubny’s death certificate had a serial number in the top right corner, 131.

Under a Justice Ministry procedure, all death certificates are numbered, starting from zero at the start of the year and going up by one digit for each new death recorded.

The Russian diplomat confirmed that is the procedure.

Reuters saw two other certificates, both issued on Feb. 3. The numbers - 9 and 13 - indicate certificates for at least five deaths were issued on that day. They were both private military contractors, according to people who know them.

The death of a Russian citizen would have to be registered at the consulate in order to repatriate the body back to Russia via civilian channels, according to the Russian diplomat.

A death certificate from the consulate would also help with bureaucracy back home relating to the dead person’s assets, the diplomat said.

The bodies of Russians fighting on the rebel side are not repatriated, according to a former Russian official who dealt with at least six cases of Russians killed in Syria and the relatives of four Russian Islamists killed there.

A few thousand Russian citizens with Islamist sympathies have traveled to rebel-held areas since the conflict began in 2011, according to Russian officials.",Exclusive: Death certificate offers clues on Russian casualties in Syria,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CW1LP-OCATP

Dangdang, an Amazon Inc (AMZN.O) rival in China, is also in talks with other potential investors, said the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was private.

Dangdang told Reuters it has been approached by investors and has not accepted any offer. It said, without elaborating, that other details of talks with suitors were inaccurate. HNA declined to comment.

The development comes after $50 billion worth of deal-making over the past two years sparked public scrutiny of HNA’s opaque ownership and use of leverage, prompting the conglomerate to slow the pace of acquisitions in recent months.

The buying spree has brought HNA business interests as varied as aviation, logistics, hospitality and financial services. The Dangdang talks come as HNA looks to build e-commerce platforms.

The latest deal is likely to value Beijing-based Dangdang at 8 billion to 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion to $1.5 billion), the people said. Financial terms are not yet finalised and the talks could still collapse, they said.

HNA aims to own slightly more than 90 percent, one of the people said.

The acquisition, if successful, would give HNA access to a major local e-commerce platform that evolved from a leading bookseller to a marketplace of over 14,000 stores selling goods as varied as DVDs, cosmetics, clothes and furniture.

China is the world’s largest e-commerce market. Online retail as a percentage of total retail has grown steadily in the last few years, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and JD.com Inc (JD.O) leading the segment.

HNA plans to buy the majority of Dangdang from management, mainly Chairwoman Peggy Yu and Chief Executive Officer Li Guoqing, who founded the firm in 1999, the people said.

Dangdang was taken private for $556 million last year, having debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010.

HNA is also scouting for co-investors for the deal, said one of the people.

HNA and other Chinese conglomerates have come under scrutiny due to the billions of dollars spent on marquee real estate properties and global brands, with the government concerned about the impact of capital outflows on the value of the yuan.

HNA has nevertheless completed a number of long-stalled overseas acquisitions in recent weeks. It is set to complete the $1 billion acquisition of Singapore-listed logistics firm CWT Ltd (CWTD.SI) next week.

The conglomerate also obtained Ministry of Commerce approval this month for the $775 million purchase of 51 percent of the oil products and logistics business of Glencore PLC (GLEN.L).",China's HNA in talks to buy e-commerce firm Dangdang likely valued over $1 billion: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dangdang-m-a-hna-group/chinas-hna-in-talks-to-buy-e-commerce-firm-dangdang-likely-valued-over-1-billion-sources-idUSKBN1CW0O9

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday.

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were “one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins” in the automaker’s North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company’s promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders.

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford’s new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects.

Ford’s share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV “in the sweet spot of the market” in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi’s U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi’s current lineup of SUVs “pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future,” Keogh said.

Renault SA (RENA.PA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become “a significant contributor to our performance.”

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

“I‘m sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future,” he said.","Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1CW0EZ-OCATC

Teodorin Obiang, eldest son of President Teodoro Obiang and a vice-president himself, was also handed a three-year suspended prison sentence and a suspended 30 million euros ($35 million) fine.

The Paris court found Obiang, 48, guilty of embezzlement, and ordered the confiscation of more than 100 million euros worth of his French assets. Obiang denied the charges.

The case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in France by long-time leaders and family relatives in several African countries including Gabon and Congo Republic.

Obiang was first put on trial in January but the case, 10 years in the works, was postponed after his lawyers argued they had not had enough time to prepare his defence.

Obiang’s luxury residence on Paris’ Avenue Foch - a grand, sweeping road near the Arc de Triomphe often favoured by wealthy African expatriates and politicians - was among the assets scrutinised during the trial.

The property, bought for 25 million euros in 2005, had a gym, hair-dressing studio and disco with cinema screen.

Paris prosecutor Jean-Yves Lourgouilloux said Obiang’s “fraudulent spending” amounted to more than 150 million euros.

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Clariant-Chef Hariolf Kottmann gab am Freitag dem Druck von White Tale nach und trug die geplante 20-Milliarden-Dollar-Fusion mit dem US-Rivalen Huntsman zu Grabe. Nach der schweren Niederlage will Kottmann vorerst alleine weitermachen. Doch Experten rechnen damit, dass Clariant nun zu einem Übernahmeziel wird oder zerschlagen werden könnte, Interesse an Teilen dürfte etwa die deutsche Evonik zeigen. Der Triumph von White Tale ist Händler zufolge das erste Mal, dass eine so große Transaktion in der Schweiz an der Opposition eines Aktivisten scheitert.

Anstoß für das Abblasen der Fusion war eine Aufstockung der Beteiligung von White Tale an Clariant. Die Schweizer Börse meldete am Freitag morgen, dass White Tale nun 20 Prozent halte und bestätigte damit einen Bericht der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Zudem hätten sich weitere Anleger hinter die Amerikaner geschart. Der Basler Konzern hätte die Zustimmung von zwei Dritteln der Clariant-Aktionäre benötigt, um die Transaktion in trockene Tücher zu bringen. Diese Hürde erwies sich nun als zu hoch. “Unter diesen Umständen und angesichts des hohen Maßes an Beeinträchtigung und Unsicherheit, das dadurch für beide Unternehmen entstanden ist, haben wir gemeinsam beschlossen, den Fusionsvertrag aufzuheben”, teilten die beiden Firmenlenker Kottmann und Peter Huntsman mit.

Clariant-Großaktionär White Tale hatte in der Vergangenheit wiederholt kritisiert, dass der Schweizer Konzern bei einem Zusammenschluss mit Huntsman zu niedrig bewertet werde. Zudem stellte er die industrielle Logik der Fusion in Frage. Der aktivistische Investor hatte stattdessen gefordert, dass die Sparte Plastics & Coatings verkauft werde.

An der Schweizer Börse reagierten die Anleger verschnupft, die Clariant-Aktien brachen um sechs Prozent ein.

ZWEITGRÖSSTER AKTIONÄR STELLT SICH HINTER KOTTMANN

Trotz der Niederlage macht Clariant mit dem bestehenden Management und Verwaltungsrat weiter. Kottmann, der als Architekt der Fusion gilt, will bei dem Konzern bleiben. Helfen dürfte ihm einem Experten zufolge, dass Clariant die im Fall einer abgebrochenen Transaktionen fällige Zahlung im dreistelligen Millionenbereich an Huntsman nicht leisten muss. Rückendeckung erhält Kottmann zudem von bayrischen Familien, die mit einem Anteil von rund 14 Prozent zweitgrößte Eigner des Unternehmens sind. “Clariant hat sich durch den langjährigen Einsatz von Hariolf Kottmann und seinem Team hervorragend entwickelt, und ist bestens aufgestellt, den erfolgreichen Kurs auch ohne den geplanten Zusammenschluss fortzusetzen”, erklärte ihr Vertreter Konstantin Winterstein.

HuntsmanClariant sollte der nach Evonik weltweit zweitgrößte Spezialchemiekonzern mit einem Umsatz von gut 13 Milliarden Dollar und 28.200 Mitarbeitern werden. Doch schon als Kottmann und Huntsman den Deal im Mai präsentierten, lösten sie keine Begeisterungsstürme aus. Analysten sprachen von einem Zusammenschluss, mit dem Clariant eine mögliche feindliche Übernahme vereiteln wollte. Auch in den folgenden Monaten gelang es den beiden nicht, genügend Anleger ins Boot zu holen, um die Transaktion zu retten. Anfang Oktober war dann klar, dass dem Deal Schiffbruch droht.

CLARIANT PRÜFT ALTERNATIVEN

Wie es nun weitergeht, ist unklar. Kottmann will Alternativen prüfen. “Clariant hatte und hat noch immer mehrere Optionen, um den Wert für die Aktionäre und die Stakeholder zu erhöhen”, sagte er. “Eine Fusion unter gleichen... ist eine Option, eine große transformative Transaktion ist eine andere Option, alleine weiterzumachen ist eine dritte Option.” Am Dienstag präsentieren die Schweizer ihre Geschäftszahlen für das dritte Quartal.

Deutlicher wird Baader Helvea-Analyst Markus Mayer: “Jetzt ist Clariant wieder das Übernahmeziel Nummer eins unter den europäischen Chemiefirmen.” In der Vergangenheit hatte der Experte etwa BASF oder Lanxess als Kaufanwärter genannt. Christian Faitz vom Broker Kepler Cheuvreux erwartet, dass der Druck auf eine Zerschlagung des Spezialchemiekonzerns wächst. Sollte Clariant zerlegt werden, dürfte etwa die Essener Evonik Teile davon anschauen, heißt es in Branchenkreisen. Die ganze Clariant wäre für Evonik aber zu groß.

Dass sich Aktivisten in der Chemiebranche tummeln, ist nicht neu. So drängten Fonds die US-Konzerne Dow und Du Pont zu einem Zusammenschluss. Ihr Jagdgebiet beschränkt sich aber keineswegs auf diesen Sektor. Allein in der Schweiz haben die Fonds etwa beim Nahrungsmittelriesen Nestle, beim Elektrokonzern ABB und bei der Großbank Credit Suisse für Unruhe gesorgt. Kottmann rechnet damit, dass das zunehmen wird. “Ich neige zu der Ansicht, dass das eine gefährliche Entwicklung für viele Firmen, Branchen und tausende von Arbeitsplätzen ist”, sagte der Deutsche. “Das ist nicht gesund für die Wirtschaft dieses Landes.”",Großaktionär versenkt Milliarden-Fusion von Clariant,https://www.reuters.com/article/schweiz-clariant-idDEKBN1CW0PT

Mas o presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), já havia expressado clara insatisfação com o envio de MPs pelo Executivo, apontando que o governo deveria optar por projetos de lei para contar com seu apoio na tramitação das matérias.

The drugstore and pharmacy-benefit company should be able to generate some cost savings if its $66 billion offer for the health insurer prevails. Even more important, it could help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow.

Getting drugs from producers to consumers is a complex and foggy business, with multiple middlemen capturing bits and pieces along the way. Combining CVS and Aetna would create a single business able to negotiate a lower price from a drugmaker, dispense the medicine, and insure customers so they can pay for it.

That could mean savings from fewer administrative staff and combined IT systems. The nation’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, runs a prescription drug benefit business in-house that has done well. There may be a cost though. Rival insurer Anthem recently partnered with CVS to form a drug-benefit business due to start in 2020. Whether Anthem would want to play ball with Aetna in the picture is a big question.

Yet it’s notable that this overture became public the same day that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch confirmed Amazon had received approval from multiple states to become a wholesale pharmaceutical distributer. Rumor and logic suggest strongly that the retailer will ultimately offer prescriptions online.

That news caused widespread damage to drug middlemen stocks earlier in the day. CVS, for example, saw its shares initially fall up to 6 percent on the news. Currently pharmacy-benefit managers can negotiate discounts with drugmakers in the dark, push customers toward captive pharmacies and extract a profit. It’s one of the reasons why healthcare is so much more costly and complex in America than in most developed countries. Amazon on the other hand, is notorious for disrupting businesses, focusing on customers, and being willing to accept nearly non-existent margins. For CVS, having an insurer steer a lot of customers its way might help neuter the Amazon threat.

Of course, CVS’s strategy may have side effects of its own. U.S. politicians and consumers have become increasingly critical of the high cost and murkiness of drug pricing. Transparency may be coming regardless of what deals are made.",Breakingviews - Aetna bid is a defensive prescription for CVS,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aetna-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-aetna-bid-is-a-defensive-prescription-for-cvs-idUSKBN1CV3OK

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs in the coming week for the first time in more than 10 years. But is the country really ready?

The consensus is for rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

That 0.25 percent was where the BoE put Bank Rate just over a year ago, shortly after British voters elected to leave the European Union. And there’s the rub: the uncertainty the vote triggered is still there.

A Reuters poll published in the past week showed more than 70 percent of economists believe now is not the time to raise rates -- though slightly more than that said it would happen anyway.

BoE Governor Mark Carney has made it clear a hike is in the offing, if not specifically saying at this coming meeting.

His concern is that low unemployment means Britain’s economy has little spare capacity and, accordingly, faces upward inflation pressure. Added to that are moves by other major central banks to rein in loose monetary policy, which could also push inflation higher by weakening the pound further.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again. The European Central Bank is cutting back on its bond buying, albeit gently.

So the BoE needs to concern itself with a pressured pound and high employment driving up inflation that, at 3 percent, is already well above target and the highest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations.

But ranged against that is huge political and economic uncertainty over how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will play out.

Companies are unclear about what to plan for, ranging from little short-term change to a complete revolution in how they do business.

Consumers too are wary as, while Britain’s economy has by no means not gone over a cliff, it has had some wobbles.

Retail sales, for example, contracted on a monthly basis in September and were up 1.2 percent year-on-year versus 4.1 percent a year earlier.

Preliminary third-quarter growth figures in the past week, meanwhile, were slightly better than expected. But at 1.5 percent year-on-year they are well below pre-Brexit vote levels and significantly lag both the United States and the euro zone.

This had prompted some economists to suggest Carney and the BoE are about to “do a Trichet” -- mirroring then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet’s raising of rates in 2008 just as the financial crisis was hitting.

Former BoE policymaker Danny Blanchflower - who voted against the BoE’s last hike in 2007, and has been regularly critical of suggestions to tighten policy since - has been scathing about the idea of a UK hike now.

“Nothing in data whatsoever says there should be a rate rise,” he tweeted.

(NOT) RISING SUN

The BoE is not the only central bank discussing policy. The Bank of Japan will announce its decisions on Tuesday.

Deflation -- Japan’s biggest economic problem for much of the past 20 years -- is over, but inflation is far from entrenched, limping along at just 0.7 percent year-on-year.

The economy too is somewhat off the pace, with the International Monetary Fund predicting 1.5 percent growth this year, though that is an improvement from 2016.

The biggest issue among economists with regard to the BoJ is whether it should reveal its plans to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy.

“We are anticipating few major changes in monetary policy,” Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at SuMi TRUST, wrote in a note. “The medium-term outlook for the Japanese economy is largely unchanged since the last policy meeting so the BoJ is likely to maintain the status quo.”

Underlining this, Reuters polls suggest the BoJ won’t start rolling back its monetary stimulus until late next year at the earliest -- the sort of unclouded policy outlook that the BoE’s Carney might arguably have cause to envy before the week is out.",Place your bets for the Brexit rate hike,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-economy-outlook/place-your-bets-for-the-brexit-rate-hike-idUKKBN1CW1R9

Kennedy but yielded to pressure from the FBI and CIA to block the release of other records to be reviewed further.

Congress had ordered in 1992 that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into Kennedy’s death should be fully opened to the public through the National Archives in 25 years, by Oct. 26, 2017, except for those the president authorized for further withholding.

Trump had confirmed on Saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once-classified records, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, “subject to the receipt of further information.”

But as the deadline neared, the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next 180 days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted.

The law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations, national defense, law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the public’s interest in full disclosure.

More than 2,800 uncensored documents were posted immediately to the National Archives website on Thursday evening - a staggering, disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators, scholars and conspiracy theorists.

The rest will be released “on a rolling basis,” with “redactions in only the rarest of circumstances,” by the end of the review on April 26, 2018, the White House said in a statement.

In a memo to government agency heads, Trump said the American people deserved as much access as possible to the records.

“Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” he wrote, adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now.

A Central Intelligence Agency spokesman told Reuters that every single one of approximately 18,000 remaining CIA records in the collection would ultimately be released, with just 1 percent of the material left redacted.

CIA Director Mike Pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the White House for keeping some materials secret, one senior administration official said.

While Kennedy was killed over half a century ago, the document file included material from investigations during the 1970s through the 1990s. Intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent “law enforcement equities” and other materials that still have relevance, the official said.

Trump was resistant but “acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months,” the official added.

QUELLING CONSPIRACY THEORIES?

Academics who have studied Kennedy’s slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the president’s open limousine that day in Dallas from an upper window of the Texas Book Depository building overlooking the motorcade route.

They likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old Democratic president’s killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.

Of the roughly 5 million pages of JFK assassination-related records held by the National Archives, 88 percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late 1990s, and 11 percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted. Only about 1 percent have remain withheld in full, according to the National Archives.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy’s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, although they retain a powerful cultural currency.

“My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin,” said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College. “It’s hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history. But that’s where the evidence is.”

Kennedy’s assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s. He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.","Trump releases some JFK files, blocks others under pressure",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-jfk-release/trump-releases-some-jfk-files-blocks-others-under-pressure-idUSKBN1CV3KL

Nei fatti, la dichiarazione di indipendenza della Catalogna è un gesto simbolico che non sarà accettato dalla Spagna e dalla comunità internazionale, ma la mossa porta la peggior crisi politica spagnola degli ultimi 40 anni.

Il primo ministro Mariano Rajoy ha immediatamente invitato alla calma e ha detto che sarà ripristinato lo stato di diritto.

La mozione passata nel parlamento regionale di Barcellona -- che è stata boicottata dai partiti di opposizione -- dice che la Catalogna costituisce uno stato indipendente, sovrano e social democratico e chiede agli altri paesi e istituzioni di riconoscerlo. Vuole anche colloqui con Madrid per collaborare a fondare una nuova repubblica.

“Non sarà facile, non sarà gratis e non sarà in un giorno. Ma non ci sono alternative al processo verso la repubblica catalana”, ha detto la parlamentare Marta Rovira dell‘allenza pro-indipendenza Junts pel Si durante il dibattito prima del voto.

Dopo il dibattito, i parlamentari dei tre principali partiti nazionali - popolari, socialisti e Ciudadanos -- sono usciti dall‘aula. I membri dei partiti indipendentisti e quello di estrema sinistra Podemos hanno votato 70 a 10 a favore dell‘indipendenza.

Intanto a Madrid, il Senato ha approvato l‘articolo 155, che consente al governo centrale, che si riunirà alle 18 per adottare le prime misure necessarie, di prendere il controllo diretto della regione autonoma.

Il presidente del Consiglio Ue Donald Tusk ha detto che la dichiarazione non cambia nulla e che il governo centrale di Madrid resta l‘unico interlocutore per l‘Unione europea.

Anche il dipartimento di Stato Usa ha detto che la Catalogna è parte integrante della Spagna e che Washington appoggia le mosse di Madrid per tenere il paese unito.

Dopo la dichiarazione di indipendenza, i Cds sovrani spagnoli sono saliti di 2 punti base a 70 pb, mentre la borsa di Madrid si avvia ad una chiusura in calo dell‘1,5%.

The two sides have held discussions, and talks are continuing ahead of a mid-December deadline to prepare proxy resolutions for next spring’s shareholder meeting, activists said.

An Exxon spokesman said it was meeting with investors but declined to discuss specifics.

A number of investors said they were looking for Exxon to give details such as those recently recommended by a climate task force of the Financial Stability Board. It suggested companies lay out the impact they would face from policies like carbon pricing plans, or how changes in supply and demand for resources like oil would affect their balance sheets.

“We’re hopeful that Exxon will take the opportunity to get in front of this and set new standards in terms of disclosure and transparency around climate change,” said Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research for asset manager Schroders, one of the filers of the resolution which has since spoken with Exxon executives.

Spokespeople for the Church of England and for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the lead sponsors of the May resolution, also confirmed they were in talks with Exxon.

“We have an active engagement process for environmental, social and governance matters,” said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri, who declined to comment on specific meetings with activists. Last year, the company interacted with shareholders that held 1.1 billion shares, including 40 percent of its institutional holders, he said.

In May, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said the world’s largest publicly-traded energy company would consider the issue after 62 percent of shares voted at the meeting supported a non-binding call for an annual climate-impact review.

Exxon faces several lawsuits, including from New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general, over the possibility it misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change. Exxon has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated.

Calls for companies to disclose more about how they will fare in a warming world received higher-than-usual levels of support at shareholder meetings this past spring, sometimes with new backing from asset managers like BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group.

Occidental Petroleum Corp, (OXY.N) said in a second quarter earnings presentation that it would provide additional disclosure of “climate-related risks and opportunities” after a majority of investors backed a call for such a report in May.

Also, this month refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the Financial Stability Board.

A shareholder measure calling for a climate-impact report received 41 percent support at Marathon’s annual meeting in April.

Some investor activists have a “wait and see” position on what Exxon may disclose. “It’s very unclear what Exxon is going to do” at this point, said Danielle Fugere, president of shareholder advocate As You Sow. She said the California group withdrew a resolution ahead of Exxon’s 2014 shareholder meeting calling for a climate risk analysis, only to be disappointed by the resulting document. On the other hand, were Exxon to do nothing this time around, its directors could face calls for their removal, Fugere said.","Exxon, investors huddle on climate data as proxy deadline looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/exxon-mobil-climate-report/exxon-investors-huddle-on-climate-data-as-proxy-deadline-looms-idINKBN1CW2MF?il=0

Nach Angaben der kurdischen Regionalregierung vereinbarten die Peschmerga-Kämpfer einen Waffenstillstand mit den irakischen Truppen. Ministerpräsident Haider Al-Abadi ordnete seinerseits am Freitag eine 24-stündige Unterbrechung von Militäreinsätzen gegen die Kurden im Norden des Landes an. Laut Abadis Büro hatte US-Außenminister Rex Tillerson die Zentralregierung zu einem Dialog mit den Kurden gedrängt. Die Bevölkerungsgruppe hatten am 25. September für die Unabhängigkeit gestimmt. Die irakische Regierung schickte daraufhin die Armee in die ölreiche Region.

Die Feuerpause trat der kurdischen Regierung zufolge bereits in der Nacht zum Freitag in Kraft und wird respektiert. Nun liefen diplomatische Bemühungen, um einen Termin für Verhandlungen mit der Führung in Bagdad zu finden. Ein Sprecher der US-geführten Koalition gegen die Extremistenmiliz Islamischer Staat (IS) erklärte dagegen, beide Seiten sprächen zwar miteinander, es handele sich aber nicht um einen offiziellen Waffenstillstand. Abadis Sprecher sagte, die Feuerpause diene dazu, irakische Kräfte an die von kurdischen Kämpfern gehaltenen Grenzübergänge zu verlegen. Darauf habe man sich mit den Kurden verständigt.

Die kurdische Regionalregierung war diese Woche auf Ministerpräsident Abadi zugegangen. Sie erklärte sich im Sinne einer friedlichen Beilegung des Konflikts bereit, ihre Unabhängigkeitsbestrebungen auf Eis zu legen. Sie bot außerdem einen sofortigen Waffenstillstand sowie einen Dialog an.

The S&P technology index led the way higher, up 3.14 percent. The index was on track for its best day since March 1, 2016 and is up nearly 35 percent on the year versus the 15.2 percent gain in the S&P 500.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.30 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 7.16 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services.

Further lifting the sector were shares of Apple (AAPL.O), which rose 3.83 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. Intel (INTC.O) soared 8.10 percent after its quarterly results topped estimates and the chipmaker raised its full-year forecasts.

Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.15 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Its gains helped lift the consumer discretionary sector 1.53 percent to put the index on pace for its best daily performance since Dec. 7.

“People are concerned about overvaluation, people are concerned about what is the catalyst for those guys to attract too much attention from regulators,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

“They are the ones that everyone wants to own, has to own because they are the ones reporting the best earnings. They definitely came through, that is very positive.”

Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a 3-percent annual rate, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities.

A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank provided support for stocks. In Powell’s potential appointment, investors see a continuation of the current monetary policy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 23,436.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.22 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,581.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 147.33 points, or 2.25 percent, to 6,704.10.

Earnings growth for the third quarter is now 6.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 273 companies that have posted earnings, 74 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 72 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Not all earnings were positive, however. Chevron’s (CVX.N) 4.53 percent fall weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil company’s profit missed estimates.

Merck (MRK.N) dropped 6.58 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs.

Although the Catalan declaration appears to be a doomed gesture, both sides’ moves take Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades to a new and possibly dangerous level.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for calm and said the rule of law would be restored in Catalonia, where secessionists have long cherished the dream of a separate nation.

A crowd of more than 2,000 independence supporters gathered in the Ciutadella Park outside the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting “Liberty” in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through.

The motion passed in the parliament after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of “President!” and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem “Els Segadors” (The Reapers).

“Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever”, Puigdemont said on Twitter.

But immediately after news of the vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil in the wealthy region.

Within an hour, the upper house of Spain’s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy’s government to rule Catalonia directly -- an unprecedented move in Spain since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.

The United States, Britain, France and Germany also swiftly dismissed the declaration and expressed support for Rajoy’s efforts to keep Spain united.

FIRING THE GOVERNMENT?

Rajoy’s cabinet was meeting on Friday evening to adopt the first measures to govern Catalonia. This could include firing the Barcelona government and assuming direct supervision of Catalan police forces.

“Exceptional measures should only be adopted when no other remedy is possible,” Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an address to the Senate on Friday morning.

“In my opinion there is no alternative. The only thing that can be done and should be done is to accept and comply with the law,” said Rajoy, who has staked out an uncompromising position.

How direct rule would work on the ground - including the reaction of civil servants and the police - is uncertain. Some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow “peaceful resistance”.

“Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,” Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.

“Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.”

The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. National flags now hang from many balconies in the capital in an expression of unity.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.

The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

NOT EASY

“It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be free, it is not going to change in a day. But there is no alternative to a process towards the Catalan Republic,” lawmaker Marta Rovira of the Junts pel Si pro-independence alliance said in a debate leading to the vote.

After the debate, lawmakers from members of three main national parties -- the People’s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos -- walked out. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favor in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them.

Spain’s constitutional court said it was reviewing the vote. The state prosecutor and other parties have three days to open a case.

Montserrat Rectoret, a 61-year-old historian, was among the crowds in Barcelona.

“I am emotional because Catalonia has struggled for 40 years to be independent and finally I can see it,” she said.","Catalonia declares independence from Spain, direct Madrid rule looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/catalonia-declares-independence-from-spain-direct-madrid-rule-looms-idUSKBN1CW0VF

The S&P technology index led the way higher, up 3.14 percent. The index was on track for its best day since March 1, 2016 and is up nearly 35 percent on the year versus the 15.2 percent gain in the S&P 500.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.30 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 7.16 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services.

Further lifting the sector were shares of Apple (AAPL.O), which rose 3.83 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. Intel (INTC.O) soared 8.10 percent after its quarterly results topped estimates and the chipmaker raised its full-year forecasts.

Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.15 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Its gains helped lift the consumer discretionary sector 1.53 percent to put the index on pace for its best daily performance since Dec. 7.

“People are concerned about overvaluation, people are concerned about what is the catalyst for those guys to attract too much attention from regulators,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

“They are the ones that everyone wants to own, has to own because they are the ones reporting the best earnings. They definitely came through, that is very positive.”

Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a 3-percent annual rate, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities.

A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank provided support for stocks. In Powell’s potential appointment, investors see a continuation of the current monetary policy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 23,436.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.22 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,581.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 147.33 points, or 2.25 percent, to 6,704.10.

Earnings growth for the third quarter is now 6.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 273 companies that have posted earnings, 74 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 72 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Not all earnings were positive, however. Chevron’s (CVX.N) 4.53 percent fall weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil company’s profit missed estimates.

Merck (MRK.N) dropped 6.58 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers.","Tech, Amazon earnings power Wall St. higher",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/tech-amazon-earnings-power-wall-st-higher-idUSKBN1CW1J7?il=0

“Nós tínhamos de fato uma preocupação pública em relação a construir as condições de leniência para que o processo tivesse punição dos responsáveis, mas que se salvassem as empresas de engenharia desse país”, disse a petista.

Preso na Lava Jato, Bendine é réu em processo sob a suspeita de ter recebido 3 milhões de reais da Odebrecht para não prejudicar as demandas do grupo na Petrobras.

No depoimento, a ex-presidente destacou que as empresas estavam sofrendo com a investigação da operação Lava Jato porque estavam enfrentando “problemas” para retomar financiamentos internos e externos no país.

Dilma disse ainda que essa situação estava “comprometendo” os empregos gerados pelas empresas. Ela defendeu que era necessário punir os “malfeitos”, mas preservar as empresas que são “produtos sociais”.

A ex-presidente destacou que a discussão sobre a leniência era uma “questão presente no governo”, mas frisou que o ideal era não punir as empresas, assim como ocorreu internacionalmente. Ela citou o exemplo da Siemens, multinacional alemã que reconheceu ter cometido crimes, mas continua operando. “Não se destruiu a Siemens”, afirmou.

GRANDE INTERESSE

Dilma disse que a Odebrecht merecia “toda a atenção” do governo assim como todas as grandes empresas brasileiras. Mas ressalvou que em muitas vezes concordava e em outras tantas discordava da ação do grupo. Ela negou que a relação com a Odebrecht fosse estabelecida porque era um potencial financiador de campanha.

“Tínhamos uma relação de grande interesse, não porque eles contribuíssem ou não para a campanha, mas pela importância que o grupo tinha e acredito que ainda tem na economia brasileira”, disse.

A ex-presidente afirmou ter chamado Bendine, que até o início de 2015 presidia o Banco do Brasil, para comandar a Petrobras por dois motivos. O primeiro foi não ter conseguido demover mais a então presidente da estatal petrolífera, Graça Foster, de deixar o cargo.

The adults and teenagers of “Stranger Things 2” wrestle emotionally with the events of the first season: a town boy’s disappearance, a death, a mysterious girl with superpowers and a decaying parallel universe called the Upside Down.

“We wanted that trauma to really run through the entire season so it’s about these characters confronting the horrors,” said Matt Duffer, one half of the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created the show.

All nine episodes of “Stranger Things 2” will be released on Friday.

At the center of the show are its young teenage breakout stars. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) suffers worsening visions of the Upside Down after being rescued, forcing his friends to try to find a way to defeat the demon known as Demogorgon.

Eleven, the innocent, tormented young girl with superpowers played by Emmy-nominated 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown, is believed dead and is in hiding, staying with the town’s police chief, Jim Hopper. Frustrated at being kept away from her friends, Eleven clashes with Hopper (David Harbour) and embarks on a mission to find her mother and finally find a home.

“We wanted (Eleven) to go through her own journey in a way that was much more personal to her and wasn’t tied to the boys,” Matt Duffer said. “We wanted her to go through a journey of self-discovery without the help of anyone else.”

“Stranger Things” has become a phenomenon for Netflix Inc, landing Emmy wins and drawing a cadre of obsessed fans who launched a viral online campaign, #JusticeForBarb, sparked by the gruesome demise of supporting character Barb Holland.

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday.

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were “one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins” in the automaker’s North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company’s promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders.

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford’s new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects.

Ford’s share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV “in the sweet spot of the market” in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi’s U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi’s current lineup of SUVs “pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future,” Keogh said.

Renault SA (RENA.PA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become “a significant contributor to our performance.”

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

“I‘m sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future,” he said.","Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-motor-results-tesla-analysis/wall-street-loves-electric-cars-america-loves-trucks-idUSKBN1CW0EZ?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances.

In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August.

According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China.

Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.”

“The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said.

Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.”

“As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.”

Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.

She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.”

“It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”

Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.",U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-asia-quad/u-s-seeks-meeting-soon-to-revive-asia-pacific-quad-security-forum-idUKKBN1CW2O0?il=0

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

Lo hanno riferito a Reuters due fonti a conoscenza del dossier.

“Il ministero dello Sviluppo Economico ha chiesto a Cdp di valutare l‘ingresso in Am InvestCo perché teme che la Commissione Europea possa rilevare problemi di concorrenza. Cdp sta valutando”, ha detto la prima fonte.

Am InvestCo è il consorzio che fa capo per 85% ad ArcelorMittal che a giugno si è aggiudicato la gara per Ilva. Nel consorzio è presente con il 15% il gruppo Marcegaglia. ArcelorMittal è il più grande gruppo siderurgico mondiale, mentre Marcegaglia si definisce “gruppo industriale leader mondiale nella trasformazione dell‘acciaio”.

“Non si tratta di una richiesta formale, ma il ministero teme problemi con l‘Antitrust. Arcelor ci sta lavorando e Cdp potrebbe rilevare parte o tutta la quota del Gruppo Marcegaglia”, ha detto la seconda fonte.

Una fonte di settore spiega che il problema riguarda “i prodotti rivestiti, in particolare le zincature, perché sommando capacità produttiva di Arcelor, Marcegaglia e Ilva si supererebbero i limiti”.

Una fonte industriale dice di non sapere se Cdp sarà coinvolta o meno, ma conferma che c‘è un rischio di concentrazione in alcuni “segmenti” per Arcelor e Marcegaglia, e che in questo caso la soluzione passerebbe per l‘uscita parziale o totale del gruppo italiano.

La decisione dell‘Antitrust europeo sull‘acquisizione di Ilva da parte di Am InvestCo, in un primo tempo fissata entro il 26 ottobre, è stata rinviata al 13 novembre.

Nel frattempo, il 19 ottobre scorso, Arcelor ha offerto alcune concessioni alla Commissione Europea sul dossier per favorire il via libera, anche se Bruxelles non ha fornito dettagli a riguardo.

Il semaforo verde della Commissione Europea è uno dei passi essenziali per arrivare al closing dell‘operazione Ilva, insieme all‘accordo con i sindacati sul piano industriale.

Cdp faceva parte della cordata sconfitta nella gara per Ilva, insieme ad Arvedi, Delfin e l‘indiana Jindal.

Nei mesi scorsi Arcelor ha annunciato che al termine dell‘acquisizione Intesa Sanpaolo sarebbe entrata nella compagine del consorzio. La banca acquisirebbe, secondo un‘altra fonte industriale, il 9% mentre Marcegaglia che scenderebbe al 6% dall‘attuale 15%.

L‘ingresso di Cdp nel capitale della “nuova” Ilva era stato chiesto nelle scorse settimane anche da alcuni sindacalisti, che contestano il taglio di circa 4.000 dipendenti di Ilva chiesto da Am InvestCo oltre alla riduzione salariale.

Il ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, Cdp, Arcelor Mittal e una portavoce della direzione concorrenza della Commissione Europea non commentano la notizia. Non è stato possibile raggiungere il Gruppo Marcegaglia.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Brazil awarded six blocks out of eight in an auction on Friday for a region holding estimated reserves of more than 12 billion barrels.

BP won two of the blocks in consortia, one with Brazil’s state oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) and another with Petrobras and a unit of Chinese state oil firm CNPC.

“We will be anxious to move forward now at pace,” Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive for upstream, said after the auction.

“We came for two blocks and we got them, so we’re very pleased,” he said. “This is a significant step for us in the upstream in Brazil...These are potentially significant accumulations.”

The Brazilian oil blocks were high-quality assets regardless of the oil price, Felipe Arbelaez, BP’s regional president for Latin America, told Reuters after the auction.

BP won the Peroba block in the Santos basin with 40 percent participation in a consortium. Petrobras took 40 percent and China National Oil & Gas Exploration and Development Corp took the remaining 20 percent.

BP also won the Alto de Cabo Frio Central block in the Campos basin with a 50 percent stake in a joint venture with Petrobras.

But the company is still facing headwinds as it seeks to develop a block it won with Petrobras and Total SA in the Foz de Amazonas area four years ago. Brazilian environmental regulators in August asked them for more information and have yet to grant them a permit to explore.

Arbelaez brushed aside concerns of political risk in Brazil, after a federal judge issued an injunction that temporarily suspended the auction, responding to a request from the leftist workers party.

“We don’t necessarily see Brazil as a country where that is particularly more difficult than many other jurisdictions where we operate in the world,” he said. “It’s a reality in the business that we’re in.”

BP is looking carefully at bidding in offshore auctions in Mexico next year, Arbelaez said. The Mexican government had been responsive to the concerns of the oil industry as it prepares for that auction, he said.

The Republican-controlled House voted 216-212 to pass a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year. The measure will enable the tax legislation, due to be introduced next week, to win congressional approval without any Democratic votes.

But House Republican leaders came within two votes of failure. Democrats were unified in their opposition, and 20 Republicans voted against the bill, many expressing disapproval of a provision that would repeal an income tax deduction for state and local taxes.

Discord is also looming over a potential provision to scale back a popular tax-deferred U.S. retirement savings program known as a 401(k). Both those provisions are aimed at offsetting revenue losses that would result from the planned sweeping tax cuts, particularly for companies.

Democrats have called the tax plan a giveaway to the rich and corporations that would swell the federal deficit.

Republicans are traditionally opposed to letting the deficit grow. But in a stark reversal of that stance, the party’s budget resolution, previously passed by the Senate, called for adding up to $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over the next decade to pay for the tax cuts.

Several conservative Republicans voted against it because of deficit concerns. One of them, Representative Justin Amash, wrote on Twitter, “What happened to fiscal conservatism?”

The outline of the Republican plan announced last month would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent.

Trump, who promised major tax cuts as a candidate last year, has asked Congress to pass the tax legislation by the end of the year. Even though his fellow Republicans control both the House and Senate, the president has been unable to secure passage of major legislation, having failed to repeal the Obamacare law.

Republicans are also looking for a signature achievement as the 2018 congressional election year approaches.

“Big News - Budget just passed!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has said he wants the House to pass the tax overhaul by the Nov. 23 Thanksgiving holiday, said passage of the budget resolution was an “enormous step” toward that goal.

But he declined to take a position on the possibility of capping annual tax-free contributions into 401(k) plans, which for four decades have helped millions of Americans save for retirement by offering tax savings.

Trump and Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means committee, reopened the door to the possibility of such caps on Wednesday as Republicans scramble to find sources of revenue to cover the tax cuts.

Brady on Thursday said he was working toward an agreement on the 401(k) issue with Trump and Republicans who want to keep the tax break in place.

“They made it clear. They need this problem solved before they vote ‘yes’ on tax reform,” Brady added.

Brady said he planned to introduce the tax bill next Wednesday and to begin committee deliberations on it the following week, on Nov. 6.

REVOLT FROM HIGH-TAX STATES

Eliminating the deduction would hit middle-class voters in high-tax states like California, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Republican Representative John Katko of New York, leaving a meeting with Brady, said supporters of the deduction “stood firm, saying ‘no’ as a group today to let them know we’re not kidding.”

But one Republican senator warned that his party will have to stick to its commitment to eliminate tax breaks.

“If groups see that you’re willing to deal something away if they raise enough Cain, the whole thing’s going to fall apart. We’ve gotta hang tough,” Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said on CNBC.

The budget plan will enable the 100-seat Senate to pass tax legislation with a simple majority rather than a 60-vote super-majority, hard to reach given Democrats’ opposition. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 margin in the Senate.

The White House and congressional Republicans excluded Democrats as they developed the plan.

“Right here before our eyes, in this House, the Republicans are replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver spoon of plutocracy and aristocracy,” top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi said during the debate on the budget measure.

Independent analysts forecast last month that corporations and the wealthiest Americans would benefit the most and many upper middle-income people would face higher taxes under the tax outline unveiled by the Republicans.

The proposal would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, the analysts said.",House narrowly passes measure paving way for Trump tax cuts,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/house-narrowly-passes-measure-paving-way-for-trump-tax-cuts-idUSKBN1CV19J?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The Catalan parliament’s declaration of independence from Spain, made after a secret ballot, is now likely to be ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

Gains in the dollar were pared briefly after a Bloomberg report that said U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next U.S. central bank chairman. Powell is seen likely to maintain the Fed’s current monetary policy.

RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending with its sales tactics, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was due to U.S. government pressure and that it planned to retaliate.

San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network. It cited a report this year from U.S. intelligence agencies and said it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik.

“We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said.

Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have all recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election.

Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.”

The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules.

RT, an English-language news channel, accused Twitter’s sales staff of pressuring it to spend big on advertising in 2016 ahead of the election.

“The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch. It said it never “pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.”

Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. A former Twitter employee said the sales pitch to RT is similar to what the company uses to lure advertisers to Twitter, which has struggled to turn a profit.

On Thursday, Twitter said it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue.

Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending.

HEARING

In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters’ faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials.

On Oct. 19, U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year’s election, introduced legislation to extend rules governing political advertising on broadcast television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.

General counsels for Twitter, Facebook and Google will testify on Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

“Twitter is wisely positioning itself to be able to tell the committees that the company has taken steps to address the issues raised,” Adam Sharp, a former Twitter executive, told Reuters on Thursday.

The Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a “gross violation” by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.

“Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the RIA news agency.

Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.”

Some analysts said transparency, rather than a ban, would have been a better approach. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making the service more difficult to police.

“Banning any particular person, group or country is just bad policy - in other parts of the world, platforms will come to be viewed as a tool of U.S. or other foreign policy and it will give authoritarian regimes more excuses to ban speech,” Albert Gidari, who as a lawyer has represented tech companies, said in an email. Gidari is now privacy director at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society.

A U.S. lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, applauded Twitter’s move.

“Serving as a platform for free expression does not require assisting foreign powers in their efforts to push propaganda, whether by promoted tweets or other means,” Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.","Twitter bans ads from two Russian media outlets, cites election meddling",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-twitter/twitter-bans-ads-from-two-russian-media-outlets-cites-election-meddling-idUSKBN1CV2FG?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Em teleconferência com analistas sobre resultado de terceiro trimestre anunciado mais cedo, Leite afirmou, porém, que a siderúrgica já iniciou negociações para os contratos de fornecimento de aço às montadoras de veículos em 2018, cobrando reajuste de 25 por cento, mesmo nível do aplicado para este ano.

“O diferencial de preços da bobina a quente entre o mercado interno e o externo hoje está em 10 por cento, daí a razão de não aplicarmos o aumento”, disse o executivo.

Quando esse patamar, chamado de “prêmio” pelo setor, ultrapassa determinados níveis, os compradores no país veem mais vantagem em importar em vez de comprarem de usinas locais. Segundo Leite, a Usiminas vai buscar manter o prêmio entre 5 e 10 por cento no próximo ano.

No quarto trimestre os preços médios de aço da Usiminas no Brasil devem subir 2 por cento, como consequência de reajustes anunciados ao longo deste ano, afirmou Leite. Ele acrescentou que a companhia deverá elevar exportações nos três últimos meses deste ano ante o terceiro trimestre, mas como estes volumes foram negociados em setembro, terão preços maiores, de 595 dólares a bobina a quente, ante o nível atual de 555.

Sobre 2018, o vice-presidente financeiro da Usiminas, Ronald Seckelmann, afirmou que a companhia deverá ter um volume adicional de investimentos de 150 milhões de reais, que correspondem ao montante que deixou de ser aplicado neste ano.

Uma reativação de áreas produtoras de aço paradas desde o início de 2016 na usina de Cubatão (SP) ainda não está nos planos, apesar de a empresa estar elevando a utilização do laminador da usina de 120 mil toneladas por mês no terceiro trimestre para 140 mil toneladas nos três últimos meses deste ano, disse Leite.

“Neste terceiro trimestre começamos a perceber sinais de recuperação da economia depois de ficar estável por alguns trimestres”, disse o presidente da Usiminas em entrevista à Reuters. Ele citou como exemplo a produção de veículos, que acumula em 2017 alta de 27 por cento. O setor é responsável por cerca de 30 por cento das vendas da siderúrgica.

Os sinais de aumento de demanda estão incentivando a companhia a contratar cerca de 1.000 funcionários divididos entre a subsidiária de mineração, que deve elevar em 2018 a produção de 2,4 milhão de toneladas de minério de ferro por ano para 6 milhões de toneladas, e o religamento de alto forno em Ipatinga (MG) em abril, disse Leite.

O executivo comentou que a Usiminas deverá antecipar em cerca de um ano e meio pagamento de parte da dívida alvo de renegociação em 2016. A empresa vai amortizar entre dezembro e janeiro cerca de 900 milhões de reais da dívida 6,9 bilhões de reais reestruturada com bancos no ano passado.

In Barcelona votierten 70 Abgeordnete für die Loslösung der autonomen Region vom spanischen Staat. Wenig später erteilte der Senat in Madrid Ministerpräsident Mariano Rajoy die Erlaubnis für die Zwangsverwaltung Kataloniens. Rajoys Kabinett wollte noch am Abend über erste Maßnahmen entscheiden.

Nach der Abstimmung im katalanischen Parlament brach im Saal und vor dem Gebäude Jubel aus. Die Abgeordneten sangen die katalanische Hymne, viele von ihnen recken die linke Faust in die Höhe. Auch auf den Straßen Barcelonas jubelten Anhänger der Unabhängigkeit. Neben den 70 Ja-Stimmen gab es zehn Nein-Stimmen und zwei blanko abgegebene Stimmzettel. Vor der Abstimmung hatten die Parlamentarier der spanischen Konservativen, der Sozialisten und Liberalen (Ciudadanos) den Saal der 135 Sitze umfassenden Regionalvertretung verlassen. Sie hinterließen als Zeichen der Einheit ihres Landes auf ihren Sitzbänken sowohl spanische als auch katalanische Flaggen. Abgeordnete, die mit Ja gestimmt haben, könnten vor Gericht gestellt werden und müssten bei einer Verurteilung mit Haftstrafen von bis zu 30 Jahren rechnen.

SEPARATISTEN RUFEN ZU “FRIEDLICHEM WIDERSTAND” AUF

Rajoy rief nach dem Votum zur Ruhe auf. Der Rechtsstaat werde die Achtung von Recht und Gesetz in Katalonien wiederherstellen, schrieb er auf Twitter. Der spanische Bankenindex baute seine Verluste aus und notierte drei Prozent im Minus. Der Leitindex der Börse in Madrid verlor 1,4 Prozent.

Im spanischen Senat hatte Rajoy am Vormittag dafür plädiert, erstmals den Artikel 155 der Verfassung zu aktivieren und die direkte Kontrolle in Katalonien zu übernehmen. “In meinen Augen gibt es keine Alternative”, sagte er: “Das einzige, was getan werden kann, ist das Recht einzuhalten.” Es habe keine Veränderungen der Lage gegeben, die eine Abkehr vom Einsatz des Artikels 155 rechtfertige: “Wir stehen einer Herausforderung gegenüber, die beispiellos ist in unserer jüngeren Geschichte.”

Zu den Maßnahmen, die das Kabinett am Abend beschließen könnte, gehören die Entlassung der katalanischen Regierung sowie die Übernahme der direkten Kontrolle über die Polizei der autonomen Region. Die Separatisten in Katalonien riefen Bediensteten der dortigen Verwaltung dazu auf, den Anordnungen aus Madrid nicht Folge zu leisten und mit “friedlichem Widerstand” zu reagieren.

EU-Ratspräsident Donald Tusk erklärte auf Twitter nach dem Votum in Barcelona, für die EU ändere sich nichts. Die EU werde weiterhin ausschließlich mit Spanien sprechen. Auch in Berlin hatte Vize-Regierungssprecherin Ulrike Demmer vor dem Votum erklärt, die Bundesregierung unterstütze die Position Madrids. Man hoffe aber darauf, dass die Möglichkeiten zum Dialog genutzt würden, die im Rahmen der spanischen Verfassung gegeben seien.

Die katalanische Regierung von Carles Puigdemont hatte am Donnerstag die Idee verworfen, Neuwahlen auszurufen und so womöglich der Entmachtung durch die spanische Zentralregierung zu entgehen.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

Bloomberg News reported earlier on Friday that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell, citing three sources.

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact a big tax cut package. Warsh’s star also has faded, according to media accounts.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank position, which has dimmed prospects for him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

“When it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they’re running, especially for political ads,” Rob Goldman, vice president of ads at Facebook said in a blog post.

Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Google have in recent weeks said Russian operatives bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread divisive messages in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

On Tuesday, Twitter said it would add labels to election-related ads and say who is behind each of them, after a threat of regulation from the U.S. over the lack of disclosure for political spending on social media.

Twitter also accused two Russian media outlets of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism it had not done enough to deter international meddling.

Penney said it no longer expects an increase in full-year comparable store sales and estimated it would just about eke out an adjusted profit for the year after posting a huge loss in the current quarter.

The grim forecast sent Penney’s shares to a record low and weighed on its rivals Macy’s Inc (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), although at least one brokerage said the troubles seem to be specific to Penney and not across the sector.

Penney’s heavy discounting was across its apparel lines, with the women’s section singled out for an overhaul to expand its inventory of casual and contemporary merchandise. The clearance was during the back-to-school period, the second biggest sales period for retailers after the holiday season.

Gordon Haskett analysts said Penny’s forecast implied its comparable-store sales likely fell about 3.5 percent in August, which was concerning given it was during the back-to-school period and in a month when weather was favorable.

They, however, said the troubles seem to be specific to Penney and not across the sector.

Still Macy’s shares fell 5 percent in morning trading and Kohl’s declined 4 percent. Penney’s shares sank 16 percent to $3.05, easing slightly after hitting a record low of $2.76.

Penney, like Macy’s and Kohl‘s, has been struggling with declining demand for apparel, the mainstay of department stores, due to tough competition from off-price retailers as well as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).

Department stores try to clear out leftover inventory ahead of the holiday-shopping quarter to stock up on fresh merchandise for their biggest selling season of the year.

The clearance “increases available funding to invest in new and trending merchandise categories,” Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said.

Penney estimated it would post an adjusted loss of 40-45 cents per share in the quarter ending Oct. 28, much bigger than analysts average estimate of 18 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also said it now expects full-year comparable sales to be flat at best, while it had earlier forecast sales could increase as much as 1 percent. It slashed its adjusted profit forecast to 2-8 cents per share, from 40-65 cents.

Penney also said Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Davis would oversee the company’s pricing and planning policies to improve its predictive analytics capabilities and get a better view of current sales trends.",J.C.

Provisional results showed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals won the constituency of Lac-Saint-Jean with about 36 percent of the vote, with the separatist Bloc Quebecois in second place and the opposition Conservatives close behind in third.

The Conservatives had held the seat before the sitting legislator retired earlier this year.

The Liberals, who now hold 41 of Quebec’s 78 seats, privately say they need to win another 12 in the province to offset expected losses elsewhere and maintain their majority in the House of Commons in an election in October 2019.

“His experience, and the networks that come with it, will be a tremendous asset to our firm and our portfolio companies as they grow from solution innovators to market leaders,” Allegis founder Bob Ackerman said in a statement.

Allegis is looking to raise between $200 million and $400 million to invest in series C funding rounds, a source with knowledge of the plans said. Such rounds typically involve the last private cash injected into a company before it goes public.

San Francisco-based Allegis also said it would change its name to AllegisCyber and open an office in the Washington area to tap into the region’s high density of cyber engineers and robust investment opportunities.

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.
A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.
“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun.","ZURICH (Reuters) - A pick-up at UBS’s (UBSG.S) core wealth management business is likely to weaken in the final months of 2017 as clients withdraw money to take part in tax amnesty programs, the world’s biggest private bank said.

UBS, which manages more than more than $2 trillion of the world’s wealth, saw continued improvement in the third quarter at its flagship business after a sluggish 2016 in which trading activity by rich clients hit a record low.

But finance chief Kirt Gardner said the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slow three months, would be hit by an estimated 8 billion Swiss francs ($8 billion) in withdrawals as wealthy customers participate in government programs to declare offshore assets.

“We would expect that after the outflows in the fourth quarter you will see a drop-off in recurring revenue as a consequence and also reduction in margin,” he said in a call with analysts on Friday.

Gardner added UBS expected to see a recovery by the second quarter of 2018.

The bank, which also has investment banking, asset management, and Swiss retail and corporate divisions, said political and monetary policy uncertainty made it cautious too.

Third-quarter group net profit came in at 946 million francs, lagging the average forecast in a Reuters survey of six analysts but ahead of the Swiss bank’s own poll.

UBS shares were down 1.1 percent at 1120 GMT, a steeper drop than the European banking sector index .SX7P.

‘EXPECTING A LOT’

Net new money inflows - a closely watched indicator of future earnings in money management - totaled 4.6 billion francs at UBS’s international wealth management unit in the third quarter.

A bright spot for the unit was the contribution from Asia Pacific, a priority growth region for UBS which has seen its best ever year-to-date performance.

UBS’s North America brokerage business, which handles just over half the bank’s wealth management assets, saw net outflows of $2.3 billion, a blow to a business investors hope is on an upward curve.

“The market is expecting a lot from wealth management Americas because of the good economy and the rate increases,” said Mirabaud Securities Limited analyst Andreas Brun, who rates UBS’s stock “buy”.

The investment bank, which UBS has scaled back in recent years to free up resources for wealth management, saw adjusted pretax operating profit rise 2.9 percent to 352 million francs.

UBS’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, an important measure of balance sheet strength which UBS uses to help decide its dividend, rose to 13.7 percent from 13.5 percent in the second quarter. A drop in the second quarter CET1 ratio had been a source of concern for some investors.

However, Brun said pending legal cases and the uncertainty over future capital rules under Basel IV regulations meant it was too soon to draw conclusions for the dividend.

“That ratio is clearly good for all those who want to make a dividend story out of UBS,” said Brun. “For me it’s still too early to call it a dividend story.”",UBS cautions gains from wealthy client activity may not last,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-group-ag-results/ubs-cautions-gains-from-wealthy-client-activity-may-not-last-idUSKBN1CW0QC

MILANO, 26 ottobre (Reuters) - I commissari straordinari di Alitalia non hanno alcuna preclusione nei confronti dell‘operatore di private Cerberus.

E’ quanto dice, in un‘intervista al Sole 24 Ore, Stefano Paleari, uno dei tre commissari impegnati a garantire la continuità aziendale della compagnia aerea e, contemporaneamente, a venderla.

“Con Cerberus abbiamo avuto incontri”, rivela Paleari, “e i rappresentanti del fondo hanno avuto accesso alla dataroom ... Siamo lusingati per ogni soggetto che abbia manifestato interesse”.

Dunque, nessuna preclusione nei confronti dei soggetti non industriali? “Assolutamente no”, risponde Paleari. “Alitalia ha bisogno di un azionista stabile e con adeguate risorse da investire per lo sviluppo. Non conta se a comprare sia un fondo di private equity come Cerberus o un grande vettore internazionale”.

Per quanto riguarda il processo di risanamento di Alitalia, Paleari anticipa che “il secondo semestre del 2017 si chiuderà con un ebitda in sostanziale pareggio”. E ancora: “Entreremo nel 2018 con una dotazione finanziaria di oltre 800 milioni, di poco inferiore al prestito ponte ricevuto. Non solo: i ricavi per la prima volta da alcuni anni sono tornati a crescere e siamo riusciti a tagliare nel complesso oltre 120 milioni di costi operativi su base annua”. Insomma, “possiamo garantire già ora la continuità aziendale per il 2018”.

Paleari, però, si lamenta dei “costi esterni che gravano su Alitalia”. E riserva una critica ad AdR (Atlantia: la compagnia paga “oltre 200 milioni all‘aeroporto di Fiumicino... siamo costretti a sostenere costi crescenti pur restando a parità di servizi”. Pertanto, il commissario chiede una discussione “su come arrivare ad una competizione (nei trasporti) su basi più equilibrate e paritarie”. “Quello del commissario straordinario Paleari è un discorso relativo ai costi sostenuti dalla compagnia aerea. Con Adr c‘è un costante dialogo nella ricerca delle migliori soluzioni per la soddisfazione dell‘utente e la crescita del traffico aereo italiano” precisa l‘ufficio stampa Alitalia.

The 41-year-old professional golfer was found asleep in May behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz, which was parked alongside a road not far from his home on Jupiter Island.

Woods entered his plea and accepted the conditions, including 12 months of probation, by responding to questions from Florida Circuit Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo. He will now enter a diversion program offered in Palm Beach County for first-time DUI offenders.

Woods is eligible for the program since he had no prior criminal record, cooperated with police and was not involved in a crash, said Dave Aronberg, state attorney for the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida.

Woods has already completed 50 hours of community service as part of the program, said Aronberg.

“This particular plea agreement has no jail time,” Bosso-Pardo told Woods during the hearing. “However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and sentence you to jail for 90 days. Is that understood?”

Woods replied: “Yes.”

The hearing lasted only a few minutes. Woods, dressed in a charcoal gray suit and a gray T-shirt, did not answer questions shouted by reporters as he left the courthouse in Palm Beach Gardens and was driven away in a black SUV.

Woods told police officers at the time of his arrest that he was returning from Los Angeles, but could not remember where he was going, even though his car was headed away from his home, the arrest report showed.

Woods had five drugs in his system when he was arrested, but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report. Those drugs included generic forms of the painkillers Vicodin and Dilaudid; the mood drug Xanax; the sleeping pill Ambien, and a drug that contained THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

If Woods completes the program, the reckless driving charge will be expunged from his record. But if he is arrested again for DUI, he will be treated as a second-time offender, Aronberg said.

In a statement after his arrest, Woods apologized to fans and blamed the incident on prescription medication he was taking to manage pain from a recent back surgery.

Woods, who is second on the all-time list with 14 major men’s golf titles, has not won a major championship since 2008.

The approximately 2-foot (0.61-meter) robots come with a tower that is fitted with cameras that scan aisles to check stock and identify missing and misplaced items, incorrect prices and mislabeling. The robots pass that data to store employees, who then stock the shelves and fix errors.

Out-of-stock items are a big problem for retailers since they miss out on sales every time a shopper cannot find a product on store shelves.

Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer has been testing shelf-scanning robots in a handful of stores in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and California.

“If you are running up and down the aisle and you want to decide if we are out of Cheerios or not, a human doesn’t do that job very well, and they don’t like it,” Jeremy King, chief technology officer for Walmart U.S. and e-commerce, told Reuters.

The company said the robots would not replace workers or affect employee headcount in stores.

The robots are 50 percent more productive than their human counterparts and can scan shelves significantly more accurately and three times faster, King said. Store employees only have time to scan shelves about twice a week.

The idea of installing robots to automate retail is not new. Rival Amazon.com Inc uses small Kiva robots in its warehouses to handle picking and packing, saving almost 20 percent in operating expenses.

For Wal-Mart, the move is part of a broader effort to digitize its stores to make shopping faster.

In the past year, it has installed giant “pickup towers” that operate like self-service kiosks and where customers can pick up their online orders.

The company has also speeded up the checkout process by allowing customers to scan their own purchases, and it has digitized operations like pharmacy and financial services in stores.

Aber dann wurde doch wieder stundenlang um Positionen und Worte gerungen. Denn zum einen konnten sich CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne noch nicht auf eine gemeinsame Position etwa beim Umgang mit der Türkei einigen. Zum anderen wurde bei den Sondierungen in Berlin aber auch Rücksicht auf einen Mann genommen, der gar nicht anwesend war - nämlich Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron.

Das Ergebnis ist ein zweiseitiges Papier zum Sondierungsstand, das tatsächliche Fortschritte bei den Verhandlungen eher verschleiert als betont. Nach außen wirkt es eher wie ein Arbeitauftrag, worüber in den nächsten Sondierungsrunden noch gesprochen werden muss. In Wahrheit ist man aber an etlichen Punkten weiter.

RÜCKSICHT AUF MACRON

Bei keinem Thema wird dies so deutlich wie bei der Euro-Zonen-Reform. Zum einen wird die Anwendung des Stabilitätspaktes und die Überführung des Fiskalpakts in EU-Recht betont - das kommt sowohl der FDP-Forderung nach einer strikten Anwendung der Stabilitätsregeln als auch dem Grünen-Wunsch entgegen, die Absprachen zwischen den Regierungen in der EU zurückzufahren. Beide Parteien lobten deshalb diese Ergebnisse.

Und obwohl sich laut Verhandlungsteilnehmern alle vier Parteien einig sind, dass sie eigentlich kein neues Euro-Zonen-Budget wollen, wie es Macron vorgeschlagen hatte, wird nur erwähnt, dass man darüber weiter reden müsse. Hintergrund sei Rücksicht auf Macron und die enge deutsch-französische Zusammenarbeit, die in den einleitenden Sätzen des Papiers betont wird, heißt es in Verhandlungskreisen. Denn eine klare Zurückweisung der Macron-Vorschläge durch den künftigen deutschen Partner würde in Paris und Brüssel möglicher- und fälschlicherweise vielleicht als Zeichen einer eher europa-kritischen Haltung verstanden werden. Zudem war Macron zuletzt selbst etwas von seinem auch von anderen Euro-Staaten kritisch gesehenen Vorschlag abgerückt.

CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne war aber erkennbar wichtig, dass die proeuropäische Ausrichtung eines Jamaika-Bündnisses deutlich wird. “Deutschland kann es nur gutgehen, wenn es Europa gutgeht”, heißt es deshalb in dem Papier. “Wir wollen im Geist des Miteinander mit allen Partnern die EU weiterentwickeln und reformieren.” Der Grund: Man sei sich bewusst, dass die Sondierungsergebnisse in ganz Europa mit dem Zeigefinger gelesen würden, hieß es in Delegationskreisen.

BOTSCHAFTEN AN LONDON UND WARSCHAU

Deshalb stecken auch Botschaften sowohl an Großbritannien, Polen, Ungarn als auch die Balkanstaaten in dem Papier: Beim Brexit wird etwa betont, dass die vier Grundfreiheiten der EU (Kapital, Personen, Waren, Dienstleistungen) nicht geteilt werden dürften. Dies deutet eine eher harte Haltung der künftigen Bundesregierung gegenüber britischen Wünschen an, nach dem EU-Austritt eine Unterscheidung zwischen Freizügigkeit etwa für Bürger und für Waren oder Dienstleistungen zu machen.

Die polnische und die ungarische Regierungen wiederum müssen sich beim Passus “Verbesserung des Rechtsstaatsmechanismus in der EU” angesprochen fühlen. Denn vor allem FDP-Generalsekretärin Nicola Beer und Grünen-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner betonten, wie wichtig ihnen sei, dass die EU künftig härter gegen Verletzungen von Rechtsstaatsprinzipien vorgehe. Das trifft beide national-konservative Regierungen mit ihrer umstrittenen Justiz-, Flüchtlings- und Medienpolitik. Auf dem Balkan werden die Regierungen vermerken, dass die Beitrittsperspektive dieser EU-Anwärter bekräftigt wird.

DEUTSCHLAND DÜRFTE MEHR NACH BRÜSSEL ÜBERWEISEN

Eine klare Botschaft steckt auch in dem Passus zur künftigen EU-Haushaltspolitik. Die Finanzausstattung der EU müsse auch zu den ihr übertragenen Aufgaben passen, heißt es da. Wenn man dazu die Aussagen der Unions-Generalsekretäre Peter Tauber (CDU) und Andreas Scheuer (CSU) nimmt, dass die EU verstärkt gegen Fluchtursachen kämpfen, den Außengrenzschutz stärken und die Zusammenarbeit bei Forschung, Investitionen und Verteidigung stärken müsse, dann ist dies ein versteckter Hinweis, dass sich die angestrebte Bundesregierung auf wachsende Überweisungen an Brüssel einstellt.

Zudem schließt sich hier der Kreis zu den Euro-Zonen-Reformen. Denn die Jamaika-Sondierer bekennen sich dazu, dass im Rahmen des EU-Haushalts Mittel bereitgestellt werden, um ökonomische Schocks in Mitgliedstaaten abfedern zu können. Genau dies hatte EU-Kommissionspräsident Jean-Claude Juncker als Alternative zu Macrons Vorstoß eines ähnlichen Modells nur in der Euro-Zone vorgeschlagen. Das Sondierungs-Zwischenergebnis folgt damit der alten deutschen Europapolitik-Tradition, dass man ein zu starkes Auseinanderdriften zwischen Euro-Zone und den übrigen EU-Staaten vermeiden will. Denn nach dem Austritt Großbritanniens werden 85 Prozent des restlichen EU-BIP ohnehin in der Euro-Zone erwirtschaftet werden.

Auch in der Türkei-Politik deutet sich laut Beer ein Kompromiss zwischen der harten Forderung von CSU und FDP nach einem Ende der EU-Beitrittsverhandlungen und der Position der Grünen an, die dies ablehnen. Im Papier findet sich davon nichts. Aber Beer sprach davon, dass man die Öffnung oder Schließung von Kapiteln im EU-Beitrittsprozess verhindern könne - was eher auf eine faktische Aussetzung als auf eine Beendigung des Beitrittsprozesses hindeutet. Hintergrund dürfte auch der Hinweis von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel nach dem EU-Gipfel sein, dass Deutschland mit der Forderung nach einem formellen Abbruch der EU-Beitrittsverhandlungen innerhalb der EU weitgehend isoliert ist und chancenlos wäre.",Jamaika will mehr Europa - Aber Rücksicht auf Macron,https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-europa-idDEKBN1CW10E

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

“Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. “But it’s a little bit of a transition, especially as they’re trying to increase shale (output).”

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation.

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter’s exploration profit. Exxon’s total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil and Portugal’s Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.

Chevron’s stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian’s largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is “very important” in the company’s portfolio.

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron’s overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

Above the faint sound of North Korean propaganda music being blasted from across the border, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo suggested that U.S. and South Korean missile defenses simply could not stop all of them.

“Defending against this many LRAs (long-range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion,” Song told Mattis, citing a need for strategies to “offensively neutralize” the artillery in the event of a conflict.

Mattis replied: “Understood.”

The brief exchange at the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - where U.S .President Donald Trump may visit in coming days - spoke volumes about the risks of any miscalculation as tension soars over Pyongyang’s rapidly advancing nuclear weapon and missile programs.

Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.

U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to willingly denuclearise.

But, as the DMZ trip highlighted, North Korea’s conventional weaponry poses such a risk to South Korea that any attempt to denuclearize the North by force could easily escalate into a devastating conflict.

Mattis was keen to emphasize efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis, including at the DMZ, as he addressed reporters with his back to the dividing line between North and South.

“Our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” Mattis said, as North Korean soldiers kept watch.

Mattis said he and Song also made clear their mutual commitment “to a diplomatic solution to address North Korea’s reckless, outlaw behavior,” when they met this week at a gathering of Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.

He carried that same message after his helicopter flight back to Seoul, where he addressed a small group of U.S. and South Korean soldiers.

""It comes down to you to make it work, my fine young troops ... and we'll buy time for our diplomats to solve this problem,"" he said.

The emphasis on diplomacy came before Trump departs next week on a trip to Asia. He has declined to say whether he will visit the DMZ when he stops in South Korea, telling reporters on Wednesday: “You’ll be surprised.”

Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies. Kim has blasted Trump as “mentally deranged.”

The bellicose verbal exchanges have stoked fears of a military confrontation, but White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution.

At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang, and bolster its defenses.

As Mattis at one point met some of the roughly 28,000 American forces stationed in South Korea, he said the role of U.S. and South Korean troops was essential.

“We’re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can. But ultimately our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, so they speak from a position of strength,” he said.

“So thanks for standing watch, for holding the line.”","As Mattis peers into North Korea, he gets warning on artillery",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-mattis-northkorea/as-mattis-peers-into-north-korea-he-gets-warning-on-artillery-idUSKBN1CW18A

A United Nations report released on Thursday found Assad’s government to blame for a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria which killed dozens of people in April and prompted a retaliatory U.S. missile strike.

Commenting on the release of that report, Johnson called on the international community to hold Assad’s government to account.

He also launched a fierce attack on Russia, which helped broker a deal in 2013 under which Assad agreed to destroy Syria’s chemical weapon stockpile.

“Russia has repeatedly attempted to disrupt efforts to get to the truth of the Khan Sheikhoun attack,” he said in a statement. “Russia has consistently chosen to cover up for Assad.”

“This behavior can only undermine the global consensus against the use of chemical weapons. I call on Russia to stop covering up for its abhorrent ally and keep its own commitment to ensure that chemical weapons are never used again.”

Russia has defended the Syrian leader against U.S. allegations that his forces carried out the attack, saying there was no evidence. Russia said the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad’s government.

The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country’s more than six-year civil war. Moscow backs Syrian government forces against rebels in the war.

The chemical weapons investigation mechanism was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which includes Russia, in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate.

Russian ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursday’s report was discussed.

Johnson’s comments come only weeks after his foreign ministry announced he would travel to Moscow later this year to discuss international security issues.

Johnson has previously described diplomatic relations with Russia as “difficult” but said the British government had a policy of engaging with Moscow “to further mutual interests where they exist”.

In April, following the sarin gas attack, he canceled what would have been the first visit to Russia in five years by a British foreign secretary.","Russia undermining action against chemical weapons, says UK, citing Syria 'cover up'",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-un-britain/russia-undermining-action-against-chemical-weapons-says-uk-citing-syria-cover-up-idUKKBN1CW1AN

Prominent technology and financial companies are mostly absent from the list, reflecting the slow progress Washington has made in opening up China in those sectors.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who will lead the 29 companies that have been approved to travel on the trade mission starting on Nov. 8, said they will be looking for “immediate results” and “tangible agreements”.

But, speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in New York on Wednesday, he acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate.

Some major industrial companies - General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc and Boeing Co - are among the companies on the current list.

Whether executives from all the named companies end up attending could be subject to agreements or deals being negotiated in time for the visit, according to multiple sources whose companies are involved.

One of the few tech companies going with Trump is Qualcomm, which earns about half of its global revenue in China and faces a series of tricky legal issues there, including a lawsuit with Apple and the Chinese government’s review of its pending $38 billion merger with NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm said its CEO, Steve Mollenkopf, planned to attend.

An industry source told Reuters tech firms were reluctant to go, given China market access issues, the unpredictability of the Trump administration, and a “Section 301” U.S. trade investigation alleging Chinese abuses of intellectual property.

”(These) issues are extremely sensitive for tech companies said another source in the U.S. business community.

“Very few want to stick their heads up and be perceived as complaining directly, and even fewer trust this White House to do anything helpful on their issues,” he said.

Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations, which mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk.

TESTY RELATIONSHIP

Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held public office, has had a sometimes testy relationship with corporate America since taking office in January.

He disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils in August after several chief executives quit in protest over his controversial remarks on racist violence in Charlottesville.

U.S. industry sources say it has been years since a major business delegation has gone to China during a U.S. presidential visit.

Calls for such a delegation during Trump’s visit originated in the China-based U.S. business community, according to several sources, who saw a need to match growing efforts by Germany, France and Britain to promote their nation’s firms in China.

Trump, who has frequently cited the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China as a reason why Washington should take more protectionist measures, was an easy sell on incorporating a group of executives into the visit, according to the sources.

Nonetheless, some trade analysts say China has done a good job of taming Trump’s combative trade impulses. They worry the U.S. administration will be willing to paper over market access concerns during the visit in its focus on getting Beijing to take action against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.

Beijing agreed in May to grant limited U.S. access in financial services in bilateral talks aimed at reducing China’s trade surplus with the United States which reached $347 billion last year, but business groups complained it was too little, too late.

William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told Reuters he didn’t expect Trump to push hard on market access issues on this trip.

“Unfortunately, I think the Chinese aren’t going to start to respond until they feel some pain,” Zarit said. “We’re all wondering what that is going to mean.”

Scott Kennedy, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Beijing has deflected commercial issues “using a combination of leadership flattery, coaxing up to his (Trump‘s) family, token concessions, adjusting their level of help on North Korea sanctions, and threats of retaliation should the U.S. take any unilateral action”.

GAS EXPORTS

Agribusiness and energy firms dominate the delegation list. They include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM), one of the world’s largest grain companies, and chemicals and agribusiness giant DowDuPont.

Ten of the companies are involved in gas or other energy fields, including Cheniere Energy Inc, which operates the only U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal, three that are building new projects, and Freepoint Commodities, founded and run by David Messer, who led power utility Sempra’s vaunted commodities division.[L2N1N109T]

Their presence underscores the U.S. ambition to sell more of its excess gas abroad as its shale revolution contributes to a global LNG glut.

Others on the list who confirmed plans to attend include GE, Houston-based LNG company Delfin Midstream, SolarReserve, Stine Seed Company, biotech firm Drylet, wastewater-processing firm Viroment and the U.S. Soybean Export Council.

Bell Helicopter and crane-maker Terex Corp are also on the delegation list. Honeywell, DowDuPont and ADM did not respond immediately to a request for comment and Freepoint, Cheniere, Sempra Energy, and Texas LNG Brownsville LLC said they had no comment.

Boeing told Reuters it does not yet have plans to send anyone but that may change. Alaska Gasline Development Corp said it had no information to release.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which is leading the delegation, has not yet issued its own list.

At least one of the companies on the list tried to distance itself from Trump. SolarReserve told Reuters in a statement that it had been selected to participate in the commerce department’s delegation but stressed that “we are not part of the business delegation travelling to China with President Trump.”

TOUTING EXISTING DEALS

One U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Trump will tout deals announced during the trip, but they would have likely happened regardless.

The risk is that commercial deals “distract from long-term political solutions” to trade issues, the official said.

Evan Medeiros, former President Barack Obama’s top Asia adviser, made a similar point in Washington. Beijing would avoid seriously addressing the “underlying systemic problems” such as market access for high-tech goods and intellectual property protection during the visit, he predicted.

“The Chinese will be happy to buy a lot of American goods. That’s what they know Trump wants – big export numbers,” he said, predicting that China would announce big business deals and allow the president to tout them during his visit.","Exclusive: Energy, not tech or finance, in CEO line-up for Trump's China visit",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CW1GY-OCATP

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

Given lingering consumer concerns about cost and charging infrastructure, many in the industry expect it will take at least a decade for electric vehicles (EVs) to win over mainstream car owners.

But as e-commerce begins to dominate the retail sector and cities clamp down on pollution, more vehicle makers see opportunities for faster take-up of EVs as delivery vehicles, taxis and other business uses in dense, urban areas.

At the Tokyo Motor Show which opened to the public on Friday, Nissan Motor Co, an early embracer of EV technology and maker of the Leaf, the world’s top-selling electric car, unveiled a concept model of its e-NV200 electric van with refrigeration capabilities, designed to transport chilled food to restaurants and homes.

“Imagine if you have city access challenges, how will you get food delivered to restaurants, and goods to customers?” said Ashwani Gupta, head of the light commercial business at the automaking alliance of Nissan and France’s Renault SA.

“There’s no other option but to go electric.”

Nissan plans to launch the refrigeration model in Japan next year, Gupta said. Both Nissan and Renault already market electric vans in Europe.

Nissan is also looking to introduce the e-NV200 series in China in the near term as it expects demand will “explode” as big cities in the country effectively ban gasoline and diesel trucks and vans in an effort to crack down on emissions.

At the moment, the country’s electric light commercial vehicle market has yet to be tapped by major foreign automakers, although Ford Motor Co wants to drive its truck-making China partner Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) more toward electric commercial vans.

Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, majority owned by Germany’s Daimler AG, has also begun selling its eCanter electric light-duty truck in the United States, Europe and Japan, where it targets transport delivery services and convenient stores.

As increases demand for e-commerce creates more work for delivery services, Toyota Auto Body, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp, was thinking about the harried delivery van driver when it designed its LCV D-Cargo concept model.

“We set out to make the delivery truck more comfortable for drivers,” said Ichiro Mukai, who worked on the model’s design.

“In the past home deliveries mainly centered around larger parcels, but recently, a big increase in the number of deliveries has come just as people are getting smaller parcels delivered,” he said, adding that this had increased the workload of drivers.

The model’s futuristic design is based on Toyota’s gasoline-hybrid minivan models marketed in Japan, and can be adapted to operate as an all-battery electric.

Removing the passenger seat entirely, the driver’s seat configuration - which includes a retractable steering wheel and rounded seat corners - is designed to enable drivers to get in and out of the vehicle more quickly and easily.

A removable tablet device in the center of the steering wheel enables drivers to easily locate parcels in the hold, where track shelving units and a wider door opening allows for easy access to parcels from outside the vehicle.",Special delivery: Automakers make plug for electric vans,https://www.reuters.com/article/autoshow-tokyo-deliveryvans/special-delivery-automakers-make-plug-for-electric-vans-idINKBN1CW0TJ

A woman with distinct similarities to near-contemporary depictions of Mary was revealed during an examination of a portrait of Sir John Maitland, attributed to Adrian Vanson, a Dutchman who was court painter to Mary’s son King James VI of Scotland (James I of England).

The X-ray showed the shape of a woman’s face and the outline of her dress and hat beneath the upper layers of paint in a pose and a likeness similar to those of the queen at the time.

Mary was forced to abdicate in 1567 after she was implicated in her husband’s murder and was then imprisoned in England by her cousin Elizabeth I from 1568 and executed in 1587.

The painting usually hangs in the National Trust’s Ham House southwest of London.

“Vanson’s portrait of Sir John Maitland is an important picture in the National Trust collection, and the remarkable discovery of the unfinished portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots adds an exciting hidden dimension to it,” said David Taylor, Curator of Pictures and Sculpture at the National Trust.

“It shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing,” he added.

The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances.

In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August.

According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China.

Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.”

“The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said.

Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.”

“As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.”

Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.

She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.”

“It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”

Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.",U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CW2O1-OCATP

Reuters reported in June that McAfee was among several Western technology companies that had acceded in recent years to greater demands by Moscow for access to source code, the instructions that control basic operations of computer equipment.

The reviews, conducted in secure facilities known as “clean rooms” by Russian companies with expertise in technology testing, are required by Russian defense agencies for the stated purpose of ensuring no hidden “backdoors” exist in foreign-made software.

But security experts and former U.S. officials have said those inspections provide Russia with opportunities to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited in offensive cyber operations.

McAfee ended the reviews earlier this year after spinning off from Intel in April as an independent company, a McAfee spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters last week.

The company declined to give a precise timeline for when it stopped allowing such reviews.

“The new McAfee has defined all its own new processes, reflecting business, competitive and threat landscapes unique to our space,” the spokeswoman said. “This decision is a result of this transition effort.”

She added that there had been no evidence of a security issue related to the reviews.

McAfee’s decision follows a similar move by competitor Symantec, which in early 2016 adopted a global policy of refusing to comply with any government-mandated source code reviews required to win entry to a market.

Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark told Reuters earlier this month the decision resulted from fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products.

Reuters reported this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise allowed one such testing company, Echelon, to review on behalf of a Russian defense agency the source code of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks.

That arrangement has prompted questions from lawmakers in Washington amid broader concerns about Russia’s use of digital means to sow discord and interference in elections in the United States and other Western countries, allegations the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

In a letter last week to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen asked how the Pentagon manages risks when using software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments.

HPE has said in the past that such reviews have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia.

The software maker has also said it closely supervised the process and that no code was allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it did not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said earlier this month that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews.

ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September.

Micro Focus said this month that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by “high-risk” governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

McAfee also allowed Echelon to review its software source code, Reuters reported in June. Such tests were conducted in a secure environment at a McAfee facility in the United States where the source code could not be copied, a spokeswoman said.

The company spokeswoman said the new policy would prohibit third-party entities, including Echelon, from doing reviews on behalf of governments.",McAfee says it no longer will permit government source code reviews,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-russia-mcafee/mcafee-says-it-no-longer-will-permit-government-source-code-reviews-idUSKBN1CV2MP

His grieving family, now also under police protection, say they have little hope the shocking campus killing will prompt a re-examination of blasphemy laws that carry a death penalty, or action against the mob justice that often erupts in such cases.

On Friday, there was more evidence the opposite is happening.

A new political party that has made punishing blasphemers its main rallying cry won a surprisingly strong 7.6 percent of the vote in a by-election in Peshawar, 60 km (36 miles) from where Mashal Khan was killed six months ago.

“Death to blasphemers! Death to blasphemers!” was a common chant of supporters of the Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan party at its campaign rallies in the conservative northwestern city.

The party’s relatively strong showing - and a separate outcry over a proposed change to an election law that outraged the religious right - has elevated blasphemy into a potent political issue in the run-up to a general election in 2018.

While Tehrik-e-Labaik (Movement of the Prophet’s Followers) is unlikely to break out of single digits in coming votes, its rapid rise, along with another ultra-religious party, could create an additional challenge for the ruling Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

The PML-N party’s leader, Nawaz Sharif, was ousted as prime minister in July by the Supreme Court, and opposition leader Imran Khan - who spearheaded the legal case that removed him over unreported income - is seeking to press the advantage.

RELIGIOUS RIGHT GAINS

In this week’s Peshawar by-election, former cricket star Imran’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party swept to a comfortable victory to retain the parliamentary seat, winning 34.8 percent of the vote.

Sharif’s PML-N had 18.9 percent, narrowly coming in third to the regionally strong Awami National Party that won just 40 more votes.

But the gains by the Labaik party - formed just last year - have grabbed attention.

Labaik draws most of its support from the Barelvi branch of Sunni Islam, the largest sect in Pakistan that is traditionally considered moderate. Though the party does not publicly talk about its funding, the Barelvis have a network of mosques and madrassa religious schools that collect donations.

The party emerged out of a protest movement against the state’s execution of Mumtaz Qadri, a bodyguard of the governor of Punjab province who gunned down his boss in 2011 over his call to reform Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, among the world’s harshest, to prevent abuses.

Qadri is considered a hero by the party, and its candidate in Peshawar, Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni, was equally supportive of Mashal Khan’s killers, although the student’s death was not a main feature at campaign rallies.

“It was state’s responsibility to punish a blasphemer, no two opinions, but when state doesn’t do its job and someone does kill, he shouldn’t be punished as a murderer,” Amini said, referring to the 57 people who face trial over Mashal Khan’s death.

In Pakistan, allegiance to Islam is the official line of most major parties, but ultra-religious parties have so far remained on the fringes.

Labaik is one of two new ultra-religious parties formed in roughly the past year.

Together, Labaik and the Milli Muslim League (MML) gained about 11 percent of the vote in last month’s by-election in Lahore and 10.4 percent in Peshawar, whereas the established religious parties, such as Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamaat Ulema-e-Islam, combined had 5.3 percent in the 2013 national election.

RULING PARTY UNDER FIRE

Blasphemy is such an effective wedge issue in Pakistan because there is almost no defense against an accusation.

For that reason, say critics, blasphemy laws are often invoked to settle personal scores and to intimidate liberal journalists, lawyers and politicians.

Dozens of Pakistanis are sitting on death row after being convicted of insulting Islam’s prophet, a specific charge that carries a mandatory death sentence, though no executions have been carried out in recent decades.

Now, political parties may be in danger of facing blasphemy accusations themselves.

Earlier in October, the PML-N found itself in the middle of a firestorm when it voted through seemingly small changes to the nation’s electoral law.

Iqbal Khan puts decorations on his son's grave in a family orchard in Swabi, Pakistan October 24, 2017. Picture taken October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Fayaz Aziz

The changes, among other things, turned a religious oath in the electoral laws stating that Mohammad was the last prophet of Muslims into a declaration using the words “I declare”.

The alterations prompted accusations of blasphemy from the religious right and the government quickly retreated, terming the change a “clerical” mistake and apologizing in parliament.

Labaik has vowed to hold a mass rally on Nov. 6 to demand the lawmakers responsible be prosecuted for blasphemy.

MOB KILLINGS

Even before the Labaik party’s political debut, politicians found promising swift action against blasphemers an easy way to appeal to conservative voters.

In March, then-prime minister Sharif issued a public order to prosecute anyone posting blasphemous content online.

The next month, Mashal Khan was accused of online blasphemy and beaten to death by fellow students and religious activists as onlookers filmed the scene. Sharif said he was “shocked and saddened” by the “senseless display of mob justice”.

At least 67 people have been killed over unproven blasphemy allegations since 1990, according human rights groups.

Mashal Khan’s father, Iqbal, said his son was the victim of false rumors.

The family has received death threats from right-wingers and Mashal’s sisters had to drop out of school.

“The snakes our country nurtured are now biting us,” the father said, two days before the Peshawar by-election, standing beside his son’s gave strewn with flowers, lace and poetry.

Learning of the Labaik party’s gains a few days later only made him more pessimistic about the government’s ability to stop abuse of blasphemy accusations.

“I know very well, I‘m not going to get my son back,” he said. “But this only adds to my pain.”",'Death to blasphemers' increasing as political rallying cry in Pakistan,https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-blasphemy-election/death-to-blasphemers-increasing-as-political-rallying-cry-in-pakistan-idINKBN1CW2EH?il=0

The Government Accountability Office said in a letter dated on Wednesday that it had accepted a request from Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker to investigate the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.

Trump established the panel in May after charging, without evidence, that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the November 2016 election. Most state election officials and election law experts say that U.S. voter fraud is rare.

Democrats and voting rights groups have criticized the panel, arguing it could be a vehicle for changes that would make it harder for lawful voters to cast ballots. A number of state governments have declined to hand over information about their voters to the White House.

In a letter last week to the GAO requesting the probe, the three senators said the commission, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence, had not responded to congressional requests for information about its activities. They said the panel’s lack of transparency could “unnecessarily diminish confidence in our democratic process.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the GAO’s decision to open an investigation.

The commission’s vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in June to turn over voter information.

The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories.

Stokes was arrested last month after an incident on a night out in Bristol following a one-day international, and released without charge, but remains under police investigation.

Key to England’s hopes of avoiding a repeat of a humiliating 5-0 whitewash on their last trip to Australia four years ago, he will not travel with the rest of the squad when they fly out on Saturday but could join up later.

“We’ve just got to sit tight and wait,” Root told reporters about when or whether that will happen.

The east African nation had been due to hold elections on Saturday in four western counties, after residents blocked roads and clashed with police on during an attempt to hold the polls there on Thursday. But those plans have been largely put on hold, the election board said.

Opposition leader Raila Odinga pulled out of the contest earlier this month, saying the contest against President Uhuru Kenyatta was not going to be fair.

He urged supporters not to take part in the vote and polling stations were unable to open in his strongholds in the west of the country on Thursday.

In the rest of Kenya, most polling stations were able to open, but turnout was below 35 percent and there were clashes in Nairobi slums and in the coastal city of Mombasa.

Kenyatta has won over 97 percent of votes counted so far, according to a local media tally, but the poor turnout has damaged his second-term mandate.

Pockets of violence continued on Friday, with police saying they shot dead one man, bringing to five the number of confirmed deaths since voting began on Thursday. All were killed in the west of the country, which supports the opposition.

POCKETS OF CLASHES

In the Nairobi slum of Kawangware, a Reuters witness saw nearly 100 youths armed with machetes in red T-shirts - the color of the ruling party - as a group of opposition supporters clashed with police. A large fire burned nearby.

“It’s only fire, everything is burned down, the fire is spreading more and more - my neighbors’ homes, businesses are all burnt,” said a tearful Rosalind Njeri, 28.

The vote has exposed Kenya’s deep political and ethnic divisions as violence flares and court cases drag on. It is being closely watched as Kenya is a regional trade and logistics hub and powerful security ally for Western nations.

Kisumu election officials, who have had to cower behind locked doors while the popping sounds of tear gas and live gunfire echoed nearby, said they were very relieved not to have to try to open polling stations.

“The (election board) officers in Nairobi were not taking consideration of our lives,” one said. “This is better.”

Musalia Mudavadi, a senior opposition leader, had earlier accused authorities of “ethnic profiling” and having “militarised elections” as they beef up security ahead of the plan to hold voting in Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya counties on Saturday.

“We advise the people not to walk into this trap of death,” he told reporters on Friday.

ONE KENYA, TWO FACES

Kenya’s first election, in August, was annulled by the courts because of procedural irregularities, denying Kenyatta a simple victory over his political rival. Turnout in that election was 80 percent.

If the expected legal challenges fail to clear a path out of the crisis, including a possible order for another re-run, the result will be a protracted and economically damaging political stalemate between the Kenyatta and Odinga camps.

“Unless the courts annul the election, Kenyatta will move forward without a clear mandate and Odinga will pursue a protest strategy whose chances of success in the circumstances are not very high,” International Crisis Group analyst Murithi Mutiga said.

The division was neatly captured in local media, with the Standard, a leading tabloid, headlining its front page: “One Kenya, two faces.”

The election commission said more than one in 10 polling stations failed to open due to “security challenges”. Its chairman, Wafula Chebukati, tweeted overnight that 6.55 million ballots had been cast - just 34.5 percent of registered voters.

A tally of results announced at the constituency level compiled by the Nation media group showed Kenyatta had won over 96 percent of the vote with 200 of 292 constituencies announced.

Figures released by the election commission showed turnout in Kenyatta’s Rift Valley and Central region strongholds was similar to levels seen in August.

However, the boycott call was heeded by voters on the coast, which is far from his western homeland and saw little violence but has overwhelmingly supported Odinga in previous polls.

Around 50 people have been killed, mostly by security forces, since the original Aug. 8 vote, raising fears of sustained violence only a decade after 1,200 people were killed in serious ethnic fighting triggered by another disputed vote.

A Kurdish spokesman earlier said the two sides reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting which broke out on Oct. 16, after Iraqi forces seized the oil-city of Kirkuk.

Abadi ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept. 25 vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack.

The 24-hour truce “should allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas, including Fish-Khabur, and the international border”, Abadi said in a statement.

“This should prevent bloodshed between the children of the same country.”

He wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - call rejected by Baghdad.

According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region’s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 a.m. on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).

“The ceasefire is holding,” Vahal Ali, the director of KRG President Masoud Barzani’s media office, told Reuters.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also urged dialogue to start, in a call to Abadi, the Iraqi central government said in a statement on Friday morning.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

OIL REVENUE

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Kurdish Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds as the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur, and also south of their capital Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.

The spokesman of the U.S.-led anti Islamic State coalition in Baghdad, U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, told Reuters: “Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire.”

In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and “refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS”. “We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,” he added.

Iraqi forces on Thursday launched an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria.

Abadi has expressed hope the group will be completely defeated in Iraq before the end of the year.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

Islamic State’s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a gruelling battle which lasted nine months.

The militants’ Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces earlier this month.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks.",Iraq orders truce with Kurds to allow peaceful deployment at border crossings,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-ceasefire-p/iraq-orders-truce-with-kurds-to-allow-peaceful-deployment-at-border-crossings-idUSKBN1CW26D

Diplomats have sketched scenarios they fear could plunge transatlantic relations into crisis: a trade war, military conflict over North Korea, or the collapse of a Cold War-era arms treaty. They wonder if their post-war alliance can survive if any of them come true.

Since Trump took office nine months ago, governments in Berlin, Paris and London have wavered between alarm at his rhetoric and a shaky sense that his worst instincts can be contained by the “grown ups” in his cabinet and pressure from allies.

But the Iran decision, taken despite personal appeals from France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Angela Merkel and Britain’s Theresa May, has changed the calculus in Europe, according to diplomats, politicians and analysts.

No longer is there an underlying confidence that Europe can muddle through three more years of Trump without fear of major, and possibly lasting, disruptions to the relationship. Nor is there faith that Trump, when the stakes are high, will listen to what his advisers and partners tell him.

The anxiety is especially acute in Germany, whose own identity is anchored in its relationship with the United States and whose reliance on Washington, particularly in defense and security matters, runs deeper than that of France or Britain.

“There is a sense of desperation in Berlin, a sense that Trump does not know what is at stake, that he doesn’t understand the historical factors that are at play here,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington and chairman of the Munich Security Conference.

“The transatlantic relationship is all about trust. In that sense, the Iran decision takes us to a new level. It is a breach of trust,” he said.

STANDING IN THE RUBBLE

Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran deal will not necessarily kill it. That depends on Congress, which must now decide to impose new sanctions against Tehran. But the consensus in Europe is that a landmark diplomatic achievement has been seriously undermined.

Merkel alluded to the breakdown in trust back in May, when she said Europe might not be able to rely on the United States and must take its fate into its own hands.

That came after a contentious G7 meeting in Sicily at which Trump ignored pleas from allies to stick with another multilateral agreement, the Paris climate accord.

Since then Merkel, focused on an election and efforts to form a coalition, has said little about the transatlantic relationship or Trump.

Macron meanwhile, has done his best to charm the American president, inviting him to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations and meeting him again at the United Nations last month.

“I don’t despair of making him change his mind,” Macron said in New York of Trump’s stances on climate and Iran.

In private however, European officials say they are worried that Trump’s rejection of the Iran deal could be a harbinger of other disruptive salvos from Washington.

One senior European diplomat said the next conflict would likely be over trade, describing Trump’s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- and his threats to abandon it -- as a “litmus test”.

European firms, especially German carmakers who produce in Mexico and export to the United States, could be hit hard by a breakdown of NAFTA.

There are also fears that Trump could carry out a threat to introduce steel import tariffs, which would hit European exporters as well as the Chinese.

“So far there has been a lot of bark and no bite from Trump on trade, but that doesn’t mean it will stay that way,” said the European diplomat. “We have to be prepared for real protectionist measures. Any steps that penalize European firms directly or indirectly would create a downward spiral.”

ANTI-AMERICANISM

North Korea is another area of concern. Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, believes the reaction in Europe to a military conflict on the Korean peninsula could be “as messy as the Iraq war”.

The European public could view Washington as the aggressor in such a conflict. This could fuel anti-American sentiment, making it difficult for European leaders to stand with Trump and emboldening voices that are already calling for a break from Washington -- no matter how unrealistic that looks in practice.

“We have to wake up to the fact that we may be dealing with Trump for some time, and that there may not be a correction when he leaves,” one German diplomat told Reuters. “It hasn’t dawned on people here that this is existential and you have to react.”

Concerns about such sentiments led a group of a dozen Germany-based foreign policy experts to issue a manifesto this month, entitled “In Spite of It All, America”, which warned Berlin against turning its back on Washington because of Trump.

Former ambassador Ischinger shares that view. But he too is concerned the relationship could deteriorate further.

One of his biggest fears is a collapse of the INF Treaty, a nuclear arms reduction pact signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Washington and Moscow accuse each other of violating the treaty and Gorbachev himself warned this month that it was in peril.

Should the INF unravel, Ischinger believes the divisive 1980s debate about deploying nuclear weapons in Europe could resurface with devastating consequences for transatlantic ties.

“All hell could break loose, politically speaking,” he said.

For generations of Germans, Ischinger says, the symbol of the transatlantic alliance has been U.S. presidents -- from John F. Kennedy to Reagan, and from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama.

“I can no longer tell my children that they are part of this alliance with Trump as president,” he said. “It is rather sad. I don’t know how the loss of this symbol can be replaced.”","After Iran shock, nervous Europe girds for next Trump salvo",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1CW1KF-OCATP

The agreement, whose details are still being worked out, came as UNICEF reported that Rohingya refugee children fleeing into Bangladesh were arriving “close to death” from malnutrition.

The WFP was previously distributing food rations to 110,000 people in northern Rakhine state - to both Buddhist and the minority Muslim Rohingya communities.

Rohingya insurgent attacks on police stations triggered an army crackdown, that the United Nations has called “ethnic cleansing”, and U.N. humanitarian agencies have not been able to access northern Rakhine to deliver aid since then. WFP deliveries have continued to 140,000 people in central Rakhine.

“WFP has been given the green light to resume food assistance operations in northern part of Rakhine. We are working with the government to coordinate the details,” WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told journalists in Geneva.

She had no timeline or details on the proposed distribution of rations to northern Rakhine, and said it was still being discussed with the authorities in Myanmar.

“We just have to see what the situation on the ground is. It’s very hard to say these things if you can’t get in,” Luescher said.

Some 604,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh in the past two months, bringing the total to 817,000, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

Malnutrition rates in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Rakhine, where the vast majority of the Rohingya refugees originate, were already above emergency threshold rates before the crisis, the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said.

“Since August 25, we have had to stop treating 4,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in northern Rakhine because we have had no access,” UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told the briefing.

UNICEF has screened nearly 60,000 Rohingya refugee children arriving in Bangladesh, nearly 2,000 of whom have been identified as having severe acute malnutrition, with another 7,000 moderately acutely malnourished, she said.

The agency screened 340 children among recent arrivals, a “rough and rapid exercise” that found 10 percent to be severely acutely malnourished, she said.

“This is an extremely small number of children so these numbers are not representative,” Mercado said.

“But what they do tell us is that some of the children are close to death by the time they make it across the border.”","Myanmar gives green light to resume food aid to Rakhine, says U.N.",https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-rohingya-un/myanmar-gives-green-light-to-resume-food-aid-to-rakhine-says-u-n-idINKBN1CW18S

Merkel, whose conservative alliance placed first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 election, is trying to form a government that unites conservatives, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on contentious issues and what one negotiator called “a big clash” during 11 hours of meetings on Thursday.

Manfred Weber, a senior member of the Bavarian conservative CSU who is involved in the talks, said the process would be “very difficult”, but his party still aimed to reach agreement by the end of the year.

“Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees ‘yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations’,” Weber told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. “And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year.”

Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel’s decision to open Germany to more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016.

Negotiators will meet again next Monday and Thursday, when they want to work out a solution on refugee policy, sources close to the talks said.

An agreement reached between Merkel’s CDU and the CSU to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday’s talks. The Greens oppose a refugee cap.

Deputy FDP leader Wolfgang Kubicki said he was “depressed” by how the talks were being conducted, adding that all parties should be ready to compromise.

He told the RND newspaper chain that no coalition agreement could be reached if the Greens insisted that carbon dioxide emissions had to be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 from their level in 1990.

“The Greens are the smallest potential coalition partner. I they insist on all their demands, we’ll have to look each other in the eye and say, ‘Bon voyage’,” he told the paper.

The Greens’ top candidate, Katrin Goering-Eckhart, said on Friday her party could not continue negotiations unless all the parties agreed to climate pledges Germany had already accepted.

But Greens leader Cem Ozdemir warned against overinterpreting the tensions that surfaced on Thursday.

“So we had one big clash, but that’s part of what happens with these issues,” Ozdemir told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.

The benchmark U.S. S&P500 index .SPX was up 0.8 percent late Friday, on track for it's biggest one day gain since Sept. 11 this year.

The Catalan parliament’s declaration of independence from Spain, made after a secret ballot, is now likely to be ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.41 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.56 percent to $1.1585.

Gains in the dollar were pared briefly after a Bloomberg report that said U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next U.S. central bank chairman. Powell is seen likely to maintain the Fed’s current monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury note yields remained lower, following the Catalan news and the Bloomberg report.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.4301 percent, from 2.454 percent late on Thursday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.9397 percent, from 2.961 percent late on Thursday.

Gold prices edged higher on Friday, after the Catalonian parliament’s independence declaration from Spain led investors to seek safety from political upheaval. Spot gold XAU= added 0.3 percent to $1,271.02 an ounce.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

The comment by Scott Jones, an assistant deputy minister at Canada’s Communications Security Establishment intelligence agency, follows a warning on Friday from the United States that sophisticated hackers are targeting U.S. infrastructure, including nuclear, energy, aviation, water and manufacturing industries.

“Targeted attacks on Canadian infrastructure is something we are really worried about,” Jones said in an interview at the Reuters Cyber Security Summit in Toronto.

“Do we think something’s going to happen tomorrow? No,” Jones said. “Is it technically possible? Yes, and that’s what we’re worried about.”

Jones said Canada had seen a level of hacking activity that was “comparable” to what had been reported in the United States.

Jones said the government rarely goes public when it uncovers hacking activity because that would let attackers know they had been caught. Instead, it quietly reaches out to targeted firms.

“We try to do it very quietly to help the company become more resilient,” he said. “We’d like to try to give the defenders as much advantage as we can.”

“We’ve yet to suffer a massive critical infrastructure attack and we’ve yet to suffer a massive loss of capability,” he said, explaining why many firms have not invested in boosting cyber defenses.

He warned that some 60 nations currently have the ability to conduct offensive cyber warfare operations, including ones that could harm the grid and other infrastructure.

Five years ago, only about five nations had that capability, he added.

CSE’s Jones said the potential for cyber attacks to harm critical infrastructure has diminished over the past two years because private companies now take the threat much more seriously.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

Bloomberg News reported earlier on Friday that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell, citing three sources.

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact a big tax cut package. Warsh’s star also has faded, according to media accounts.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank position, which has dimmed prospects for him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

RBS said operating profit was 871 million pounds in the quarter, beating analysts’ expectations as it grew income by 6 percent from the same period a year ago.

Saved by a 45.5 billion pound government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, RBS reported its third consecutive quarter of profitability as it emerges from restructuring but still forecasts an overall loss this year.

Analysts have said an expected settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over its alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities during the financial crisis could be as much as 12 billion pounds, and RBS has already set aside more than half of that figure as a provision for it.

Chief Executive Ross McEwan told reporters that while there had been no “substantial discussions” with or opening offer from the DOJ, the bank remained hopeful it would reach a settlement this year.

“There are only a couple of banks outstanding now and we do believe that time will come... We remain optimistic on that.”

Settling the case is seen by investors and analysts as a prerequisite for the British government to sell its 71 percent stake in the bank, and for RBS to resume paying dividends.

Friday’s results were the first time that RBS had achieved three consecutive quarters of profit since 2014, McEwan said, adding that the bank is on track to hit its financial targets, which include a return to profit in 2018 after more than a decade of losses.

RBS reduced costs by 708 million pounds over the year to date, putting it on track to hit its target of 750 million pounds of cuts for the year.

The bank’s shares were up 2.2 percent at 0746 GMT.

But Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, warned this might not last if any of the bank’s legacy conduct issues derail its progress.

“Shares have risen 60% in the last year as RBS has begun to show profits, but if investors get a whiff that profits are not coming next year they may lose patience,” he said.

RBS also faces the possibility of further action from Britain’s financial watchdog over the treatment of small businesses in its Global Restructuring Group (GRG) during and after the financial crisis.

The Financial Conduct Authority on Monday published a detailed summary of a report into the unit, after customers alleged GRG pushed ailing firms into bankruptcy to pick up their assets on the cheap.

The report outlined numerous failings and the FCA said it was investigating further, raising the possibility of action over an issue McEwan had hoped to settle via a 400 million pound compensation scheme.

RBS’s investment banking unit Natwest Markets saw only a modest decline in income, representing a good performance in tough market conditions that saw rivals such as Barclays (BARC.L) report tumbling trading revenues.

Elina Svitolina knew she was out of the running for a semi-final berth following Garcia’s win in the day’s opening round-robin match but that did not prevent the Ukrainian from producing her best display of the week.

Svitolina, who had lost her two previous Red Group encounters, blasted her way to a 6-3 6-4 victory over Halep, ending both their campaigns.

That result meant Garcia, the last woman to qualify for Singapore, progressed along with Denmark’s Wozniacki, who was assured of a semi-final berth on Wednesday after easily winning her opening two pool matches.

Garcia’s dream debut will continue on Saturday with a semi-final against an evergreen Venus Williams, while Wozniacki takes on White Group winner Karolina Pliskova, who can replace Halep as world number one if she wins the tournament on Sunday.

Friday’s first match started as expected with Wozniacki, whose serve had been impenetrable all week, opening with a love hold before the Dane attacked a lethargic Garcia, who coughed up a couple of forehand errors to gift her an early break.

Wozniacki had recorded two ‘bagels’ in the wins over Svitolina and Halep, and the 27-year-old chalked up a third 6-0 set in as many matches after just 22 minutes of dominant action.

As the match drifted into a decider, the Dane rediscovered her range. She began to assert pressure on Garcia’s weaker backhand side and was rewarded with an early break.

But the Frenchwoman was fighting tooth and nail to stay in the tournament and covered every inch of the court to tie it up at 5-5 on her third breakpoint as Wozniacki attempted to serve for the match in a thrilling 10th game.

Garcia once again dug deep to recover from 0-40 down in the 11th game edge ahead in the decider and the Frenchwoman sealed a memorable victory on her second match point when a Wozniacki backhand sailed long.

“The first set she was playing amazing and I was a little bit down, not believing enough and she gave me nothing,” Garcia, who has now won 13 of her last 14 matches, said in a courtside interview.

“Then at the start of the second set, I felt I had nothing to lose and increased my intensity and was able to find my rhythm and finish well.”

Despite going into the contest knowing she can go no further in the tournament, Svitolina came out motivated and broke Halep at the first opportunity, the Ukrainian rewarded for a far more aggressive approach than she employed in her previous ties.

The world number four kept her nose in front with her positive play as Halep struggled to find any sort of rhythm and Svitolina carried the momentum of the early break all the way to a one-set lead after 32 minutes.

Locked at 3-3 in the second set, Svitolina continued to play with the freedom that was missing in her opening losses and more sloppy play from Halep enabled the Ukrainian to edge ahead and she sealed victory when the Romanian found the net on the second match point.","Garcia stuns Wozniacki to advance, Halep out",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CW1K8-OCASP

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion(£1.98 trillion) in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focussed on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.

“We’re at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and we’re primed for a correction,” James said. “If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-stocks-weekahead/as-trump-tax-comes-to-floor-failure-could-spell-stocks-selloff-idUKKBN1CW1F6

Northern Ireland has been without a regional administration since its collapse in January, raising the prospect of direct rule being reimposed from London, potentially destabilizing a delicate political balance in the British province.

The British minister for the region, James Brokenshire, said last week that talks had stalled with the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) stuck over the rights of Irish language speakers.

If a deal is struck by Monday, Brokenshire would return to London to begin the processes required to form a new Northern Ireland Executive, the spokesman added.

However, if a budget is imposed by London, it would be the closest Northern Ireland has come to a return to direct rule in a decade. Brokenshire has warned the parties that they are on “a glide path to greater and greater UK government intervention”.

The DUP and Sinn Fein shared power in the previous devolved administration under a system created following a peace deal which ended three decades of violence in the province.

The head of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), one of the region’s smaller parties, has said that handing over budgetary responsibility to London effectively constitutes direct rule and “cannot be painted any other way”.

Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said a new phase of talks would begin if an agreement could not be struck by Monday. “If there is no deal done by the time the British minister brings forward a budget, that will signify that this phase of the talks - and there will obviously have to be other phases - has been exhausted,” Adams told Irish national broadcaster RTE.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who is co-facilitating the talks with Brokenshire, has said reverting to direct rule would be a “devastating” blow for reconciliation in the region.

Coveney has also urged the parties to reach a deal so that Northern Ireland can have a greater say in Britain’s talks to leave the European Union, set to have a bigger impact on the province than on any other part of the United Kingdom.",Britain sets Monday as latest deadline for Northern Ireland political talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-nireland-politics/britain-sets-monday-as-latest-deadline-for-northern-ireland-political-talks-idUKKBN1CW1PJ

The law required the Trump administration to “specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors” of the Russian government by Oct. 1, a deadline the administration missed.

Despite 220,000 schools nationwide, Pakistan has over 20 million out-of-school children, according to a 2016 government report.

The government has pumped money into schooling, with the education budget swelling by 15 percent every year since 2010, according to education consultancy Alif Ailaan. The United Nations puts the current budget at 2.65 percent of GDP, roughly $8 billion, or around $150 per student.

But experts say the government can’t meet all the education needs and part of the problem lies in quality of teaching rather than just dearth of money.

“It’s not the number of schools, it’s the quality, the attitude,” said Zeba Hussain, founder of the Mashal Schools which educate children displaced by war in the country’s north.

Situated on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, the charitable schools began when Hussain met a group of refugee children while visiting the hills encircling the city.

Many private institutions criticize what they describe as a deeply flawed government education system.

“Students are labeled ‘smart’ or ‘stupid’ right from the start,” said Shaista Kazmi from Vision 21, a privately-funded NGO that runs speed literacy programs for out-of-school children that compress five years of reading proficiency into one.

Federal education director Tariq Masood strongly disagreed with critiques of teachers, adding that population growth and funding were the biggest challenges faced by government schools.

“No one who is underqualified can enter the government system, there are fewer checks in the private system,” Masood said.

Masood said government schools adhered to a nationwide curriculum that was being constantly reworked and innovated.

The country’s poorest often send their children to one of the thousands of religious madrassas (the Arabic word for school) where students are boarded, fed, and given an Islamic education. Most operate without government oversight.

Pakistan’s madrassas have become synonmous with creating militant fighters through hardline teachings of Islam and many have been linked to organizations such as the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

But many provide shelter, three full meals, and a good education to young people whose families are unable to make ends meet.

“In certain cases people send their kids because they can’t even afford to feed them,” said Irfan Sher from the Al-Nadwa Madrassa, where all subjects are prioritized and students are capable of analyzing what they are taught.

Sher insists that the country’s future hinges on what its youth are taught.

The benchmark U.S. S&P500 index .SPX was up 0.8 percent late Friday, on track for it's biggest one day gain since Sept. 11 this year.

The Catalan parliament’s declaration of independence from Spain, made after a secret ballot, is now likely to be ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.41 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.56 percent to $1.1585.

Gains in the dollar were pared briefly after a Bloomberg report that said U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next U.S. central bank chairman. Powell is seen likely to maintain the Fed’s current monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury note yields remained lower, following the Catalan news and the Bloomberg report.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.4301 percent, from 2.454 percent late on Thursday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.9397 percent, from 2.961 percent late on Thursday.

Gold prices edged higher on Friday, after the Catalonian parliament’s independence declaration from Spain led investors to seek safety from political upheaval. Spot gold XAU= added 0.3 percent to $1,271.02 an ounce.

EARNINGS

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.44 percent.

On Wall Street, gains were led by robust corporate earnings and the third-quarter GDP growth, both of which lifted investor sentiment.

“In many ways, we’re seeing the strong getting stronger,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in New York.

“While valuations are full, it certainly becomes imperative on them to deliver solid operating results and that’s something that we did see.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 29.99 points, or 0.13 percent, to 23,430.85, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 20.38 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,580.78 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 143.84 points, or 2.19 percent, to 6,700.61.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.5 percent and Microsoft (MSFT.O) advanced 7.1 percent, which drove up the S&P technology index .SPLRCT. The sector has surged about 30 percent this year, twice the advance in the broader S&P index.

Healthy results also helped Amazon (AMZN.O) rise 13.4 percent.

Chevron (CVX.N) weighed on the Dow, with its shares dropping 4.2 percent after missed profit estimates.

Spain's IBEX .IBEX was the worst-performing major index on the day, losing 1.5 percent after the Catalan declaration. The gap between Spanish and German 10-year government bond yields also widened 8 bps to 120 bps. DE10YT=TWEB

Europe’s STOXX 600 also cut gains after the vote, but closed up 0.6 percent.

European shares reached a five-month high overall on Friday, helped by strong earnings. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.54 percent.

League strugglers West Ham came back from two goals down to beat Tottenham at Wembley Stadium to move into the quarter-finals on Wednesday.

Tottenham, who are level on 20 points with second-placed Manchester United, are looking to bounce back at Old Trafford and Belgium’s Alderweireld warned his team mates not to be complacent.

”We were not flying or anything in our heads, but I think it’s a good reality check,“ the 28-year-old said. ”You still need to work very hard, even if you’re 2-0 up, to get results.

”You have to keep the level up because if you drop it a little bit you see what happens. It’s a good thing to learn.

“Of course we’d love to have won, but we don’t have to be too dramatic about it. Next time we have to do better, and we focus on Saturday.”

Spurs’ task will be cut out for them on Saturday as Jose Mourinho’s men have won their last five home league games, scoring 16 goals and keeping a clean sheet in each victory.","West Ham loss a reality check, says Tottenham's Alderweireld",https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFKBN1CW1N7-OZASP

Merkel, whose conservative alliance placed first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 election, is trying to form a government that unites conservatives, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on contentious issues and what one negotiator called “a big clash” during 11 hours of meetings on Thursday.

Manfred Weber, a senior member of the Bavarian conservative CSU who is involved in the talks, said the process would be “very difficult”, but his party still aimed to reach agreement by the end of the year.

“Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees ‘yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations’,” Weber told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. “And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year.”

Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel’s decision to open Germany to more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016.

Negotiators will meet again next Monday and Thursday, when they want to work out a solution on refugee policy, sources close to the talks said.

An agreement reached between Merkel’s CDU and the CSU to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday’s talks. The Greens oppose a refugee cap.

Deputy FDP leader Wolfgang Kubicki said he was “depressed” by how the talks were being conducted, adding that all parties should be ready to compromise.

He told the RND newspaper chain that no coalition agreement could be reached if the Greens insisted that carbon dioxide emissions had to be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 from their level in 1990.

“The Greens are the smallest potential coalition partner. I they insist on all their demands, we’ll have to look each other in the eye and say, ‘Bon voyage’,” he told the paper.

The Greens’ top candidate, Katrin Goering-Eckhart, said on Friday her party could not continue negotiations unless all the parties agreed to climate pledges Germany had already accepted.

But Greens leader Cem Ozdemir warned against overinterpreting the tensions that surfaced on Thursday.

“So we had one big clash, but that’s part of what happens with these issues,” Ozdemir told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s $999 price tag could weigh on demand.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

Initial estimates show GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, despite the effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. An increase in goods made but not sold helped, but so did global growth and healthy corporate earnings. Protectionist policies could put the trend at risk.

Third-quarter growth was a pleasant surprise after economists projected expansion of 2.5 percent. Growth in consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic output, slowed down to 2.4 percent but is expected to rebound as the effects of the hurricane fade. And rising inventories contributed just over 0.7 percentage points to growth, in what could be a sign that companies think consumer demand will warm up.

There are other positive signs. Business investment, which had been lagging but improved in recent months, came in at a healthy 3.9 percent. Exports increased by 2.3 percent in their third quarter, which added more than 0.4 percentage points to economic growth. It’s aided by global expansion, with world economic growth in sync for the first time in years and Europe catching up with the United States. The International Monetary Fund projected the global economy would get a 3.6 percent boost in 2017 and grow by 3.7 percent the following year.

President Donald Trump has promised to cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent – but whether or not he succeeds, companies are performing well. The Nasdaq reached a record high on Friday morning after tech groups from Amazon to Microsoft reported robust third quarter earnings. On top of that, the United States is nearly at full employment with a jobless rate of 4.2 percent.

Past form suggests Trump will take credit. True, the nearly 20 percent rise in the S&P 500 since his election is partly due to the hope of tax cuts. But most of the positive economic trends are occurring without major legislative accomplishments. The biggest risk to this outlook is harmful trade policies, including a disintegration of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for which negotiations aren’t going well.

Merkel, whose conservative alliance placed first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 election, is trying to form a government that unites conservatives, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on contentious issues and what one negotiator called “a big clash” during 11 hours of meetings on Thursday.

Manfred Weber, a senior member of the Bavarian conservative CSU who is involved in the talks, said the process would be “very difficult”, but his party still aimed to reach agreement by the end of the year.

“Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees ‘yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations’,” Weber told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. “And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year.”

Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel’s decision to open Germany to more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016.

Negotiators will meet again next Monday and Thursday, when they want to work out a solution on refugee policy, sources close to the talks said.

An agreement reached between Merkel’s CDU and the CSU to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday’s talks. The Greens oppose a refugee cap.

Deputy FDP leader Wolfgang Kubicki said he was “depressed” by how the talks were being conducted, adding that all parties should be ready to compromise.

He told the RND newspaper chain that no coalition agreement could be reached if the Greens insisted that carbon dioxide emissions had to be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 from their level in 1990.

“The Greens are the smallest potential coalition partner. I they insist on all their demands, we’ll have to look each other in the eye and say, ‘Bon voyage’,” he told the paper.

The Greens’ top candidate, Katrin Goering-Eckhart, said on Friday her party could not continue negotiations unless all the parties agreed to climate pledges Germany had already accepted.

But Greens leader Cem Ozdemir warned against overinterpreting the tensions that surfaced on Thursday.

“So we had one big clash, but that’s part of what happens with these issues,” Ozdemir told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.

This week he unveiled his vision for NEOM, a shining city on the Red Sea where entrepreneurs will draft the rules and robots outnumber people. One day, the imagined metropolis may even become a publicly traded company.

While the likes of Dubai, Shanghai and Abu Dhabi have successfully gone some of the way, oil-rich Saudi has limited itself to industrial zones and financial centers – until NEOM. The megalopolis will encompass 26,500 square km, including 468 km of beachfront. It will border Jordan, link across the Red Sea to Egypt, and cost $500 billion to build.

The idea is almost bonkers, but that’s also its beauty. “The project will be the land of the future, where great minds and talents can create ground-breaking ideas and think outside the box, in a real world inspired by imagination,” according to Saudi’s Public Investment Fund, which will oversee the kingdom’s investment in NEOM.

If that’s not ambitious enough, NEOM will “without a doubt” go public, the crown prince told Reuters Breakingviews on Wednesday at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. “It’s as if you float the city of New York,” he said.

Of course New York already exists. And for global investors, the crown prince’s plan requires a healthy suspension of disbelief. But in the context of Saudi Arabia’s hopes to wean its economy off hydrocarbons, nothing can be off limits. Shifting from an era in which oil riches blessed its 33 million people, nearly 60 percent of whom are under 35, to a new model requires extraordinary creativity.

Yet to succeed, Saudi will need doers at least as much as dreamers: architects, engineers and construction workers. That makes the selection of Klaus Kleinfeld as chief executive of NEOM puzzling. In April, he lost the top job at Arconic, the specialty parts maker that split from Alcoa, after inappropriate contact with an activist investor. Before moving to Alcoa in 2007, he resigned as CEO of Siemens after losing the confidence of the industrial conglomerate’s board.

That said, Kleinfeld is a consummate networker. And the crown prince will need every kind of help he can get. The choice does, however, underline the huge challenge. Defining the dream, finding the money and making it happen add up to a task far beyond any one CEO.",Breakingviews - Saudi utopia plan is so bonkers it just might work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-economy-breakingviews/breakingviews-saudi-utopia-plan-is-so-bonkers-it-just-might-work-idUSKBN1CV1MY

“If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are increasingly pricing in the effect of a corporate tax cut into the shares of U.S. companies, leaving the market primed for a steep sell-off if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to pass one of President Donald Trump’s top priorities.

FILE PHOTO: A street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York, February 10, 2009. REUTERS/Eric Thayer (UNITED STATES)

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.

“We’re at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and we’re primed for a correction,” James said. “If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/as-trump-tax-comes-to-floor-failure-could-spell-stocks-selloff-idUKKBN1CW1EV

“He came back knowing full well he would return for a review and he went for the review as scheduled,” Luke Tamborinyoka, Tsvangirai’s spokesman said.

He could not say when he expected Tsvangirai back.

Tsvangirai’s illness has divided the opposition, with some senior party officials saying the former trade unionist should consider stepping down to make way for a younger and fit leader.

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s $999 price tag could weigh on demand.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

White Tale, the investment vehicle of hedge fund manager Keith Meister and New York-based fund 40 North, had raised its Clariant stake to above 20 percent, Reuters reported on Thursday ahead of the announcement the tie-up was dead.

White Tale’s rising stake, coupled with other Clariant shareholders who came out against the deal, left the Swiss company doubtful of mustering the two-thirds support necessary for the merger to go through.

The successful revolt comes amid a wave of investor activism in Switzerland, where Credit Suisse and Nestle both face demands for change.

Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann said Clariant still had options to explore after further talks with White Tale, which had so far not presented the company with an alternative plan.

“To do a merger of equals ... is one option, to make a large transformational transaction is another option, to continue to stand alone is a third option,” Kottmann told reporters on a call where he vowed to remain CEO.

Some analysts said Clariant could become a bid target, though its shares fell about 5 percent on Friday.

“Clariant is again the No. 1 takeover target,” said Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer, who said bidders might wait until Clariant’s share price fell further, or to see if White Tale could install management more favorable to a takeover.

The collapse of the merger also poses a challenge for Huntsman’s founding family, which was set to hold a significant stake in the combined entity but could now struggle to play a role in a consolidating industry without losing influence.

‘SOMETHING MORE SHORT TERM’

Clariant and Huntsman in May struck an agreement that would have given Clariant 52 percent of the combined entity, saying the deal would produce around $400 million in annual cost synergies and create the world’s second-biggest specialty chemicals maker behind Evonik.

In fighting the Huntsman tie-up, Meister and 40 North’s David Winter and David Millstone contended the merger would not deliver enough benefits, while exposing Clariant to Huntsman’s debt and volatile commodity chemicals business.

Speculation the deal might fail had been mounting as even supporters sold down their stakes.

“I thought it was a fantastic deal,” said one investor, who sold out on fears White Tale was gaining the upper hand. “I think White Tale want something more short term.”

Alex Roepers, CEO of the $1.3 billion Atlantic Investment Management group, said he had sold the rest of his Clariant stake on Friday, locking in a 50 percent gain in under a year.

“As a stand-alone company, without the potential merger synergies and portfolio optimization, we regard Clariant as fairly valued at the current share price level,” he said, adding he would monitor Clariant for another attractive entry point.

Clariant shares had risen about 38 percent this year before Friday’s announcement but were still more cheaply rated than rivals, trading at a multiple of 18.7 times forecast earnings against an average 21.3 ratio of peers in the chemicals industry, according to Starmine data.

TAKEOVER TARGET

A source familiar with the acquisition strategy of Germany’s Evonik said it would potentially be interested in acquiring portions of Clariant should the Swiss company be broken up. Evonik declined to comment.

Two years ago, Evonik held talks with buyout group CVC over a potential joint offer for Clariant, although Kottmann has said he never received a formal bid.

“There were never serious discussions with another peer, where we were asked if we would divest ourselves, shop the company and be taken over,” Kottmann said.

Huntsman CEO Peter Huntsman said separately he was disappointed the merger with Clariant did not go through.

Clariant and Huntsman, which said its third-quarter costs linked to the merger were $18 million, agreed to forgo breakup fees. Clariant had faced a potential $210 million hit from walking away from the deal, and a $60 million fee if Clariant shareholders failed to approved the transaction.

Clariant, which had hired Goldman Sachs to try to rescue the merger, makes aircraft de-icer, retardant for wildfires, plastics colorings, chemicals to help oil drillers separate oil from water and ingredients for shampoos.

Kottmann said Clariant would sit down again with Meister, Millstone and Winter.

A White Tale spokesman said only it would seek talks with management before commenting. Previously it said it would accept a seat on Clariant’s board as biggest shareholder.

Konstantin Winterstein, a Clariant board member and one of the representatives of Bavarian families that own 14 percent of Clariant, had supported the merger and is sticking by Kottmann.

“Clariant’s development under the long engagement of Hariolf Kottmann and his team has been outstanding and remains well positioned to continue its successful course even without the merger,” Winterstein said.",Activist investors scupper $20 billion Clariant-Huntsman merger,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clariant-huntsman-statement/activist-investors-scupper-20-billion-clariant-huntsman-merger-idUSKBN1CW0FX

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

“Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. “But it’s a little bit of a transition, especially as they’re trying to increase shale (output).”

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation.

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter’s exploration profit. Exxon’s total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil and Portugal’s Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.

Chevron’s stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian’s largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is “very important” in the company’s portfolio.

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron’s overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

The loss in U.S. oil production narrowed sharply as the price received for its crude rose 13.5 percent over a year earlier.","Exxon, Chevron results linked to oil price, not cost cuts",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-results/exxon-chevron-results-linked-to-oil-price-not-cost-cuts-idUSKBN1CW1XT?il=0

After reporting their results, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Intel added nearly $140 billion to their already massive combined market value on Friday, pushing the broader, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC higher.

The companies together generated more than $100 billion in revenue in the September quarter, roughly 2 percent of United States’ national output.

Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets, with the most bullish pegging the companies’ stocks to rise between 21 percent and 47 percent in the next 12 months.

Google is “looking 20 years young,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who bumped up his price target on the stock by 9 percent to $1,150.

Amazon’s (AMZN.O) shares rose as much as 9 percent to a three-month high of $1,063.77. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet and Intel hit their highest in a decade.

“I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

Amazon, which is winning business from older, big-box rivals, pleased investors with its transparency around Whole Foods, the premium grocer it recently bought.

“The Street went into third quarter earnings concerned about lack of disclosure around Whole Foods, and Amazon surprised to the upside here by breaking out Whole Foods contribution,” analysts at JP Morgan said.

Amazon’s shares, have risen 30 percent this year through Thursday’s close, as its AWS cloud business has stayed ahead of the competition.

Alphabet’s Google, a relatively smaller player in the cloud business, doesn’t break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but analysts estimate the business is growing very fast, complementing the company’s core advertising business.

The company’s stock is also relatively cheap, trading at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings, despite its 30 percent run this year, excluding gains on Friday.

Encana Corp advanced 4.4 percent to C$14.36, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd rose 2.6 percent to C$43.29. Precision Drilling Corp jumped 8.8 percent at C$3.23.

Cameco Corp was an exception in the sector, tumbling 9.8 percent to C$10.25 after the uranium producer posted a surprise third-quarter loss and cut its full-year production outlook.

Canadian diary producer Saputo Inc jumped 5.1 percent to C$47.20. It became Australia’s top milk producer by agreeing to pay up to $490 million for Murray Goulburn Co-operative, its second major acquisition in the country.

Bush apologized through a spokesman on Wednesday for what an actress described as a sexual assault but which Bush said was intended as a friendly pat and a joke to put her at ease during a picture-taking session.

Heather Lind, who starred in the AMC cable television network’s historical drama “Turn: Washington’s Spies,” accused Bush of groping her as they posed for photos together with his wife and others during a promotional event for the show in 2014.

The allegation surfaced in an Instagram post from Lind featuring a photograph of Bush, 93, shaking hands with former President Barack Obama during an appearance of all five living former presidents at Saturday’s hurricane fund-raising benefit.

In the post, Lind, 34, said that seeing that photo reminded her of her own meeting with the 41st president three years earlier, when, according to her, “he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.”

“He didn’t shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side,” Lind wrote. “He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again.”

Lind said the former first lady “rolled her eyes as if to say, ‘not again.'”

The Instagram post, since deleted, carried the “MeToo” social media hashtag spawned by the recent outpouring of sexual assault and sexual harassment accusations leveled against former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied engaging in non-consensual sex with anyone.

Bush’s spokesman Jim McGrath, issued a statement in response to Lind’s post that sought to explain the former president’s behavior as an attempt to make light of social awkwardness posed by his own physical disability during photo sessions.

Confined to a wheelchair, as Bush has been for about the past five years, “his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he take pictures,” McGrath said.

“To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke - and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate,” McGrath wrote. “To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely.”

Präsident Donald Trump favorisiere ihn für die Nominierung, berichtete die Finanzagentur Bloomberg am Freitag unter Berufung auf mehrere Insider. Trump hatte Powell sowie den Ökonomen John Taylor in die engere Wahl genommen. Zugleich sagte er aber auch, er schätze die jetzige Chefin Janet Yellen. Deren Amtszeit läuft Anfang Februar 2018 aus. In Washington wird erwartet, dass Trump die Personalie bekanntgibt, bevor er in einer Woche zu einer Asienreise aufbricht. Der vom Präsidenten nominierte Kandidat muss noch vom US-Senat bestätigt werden.

Mit dem 64-jährigen Powell würde ein Währungshüter an die Spitze der mächtigsten Notenbank der Welt rücken, der bereits seit Jahren in deren Führungsetage sitzt. “Als Chef dürfte er wohl die Politik der schrittweisen Normalisierung der Geldpolitik fortsetzen, die Amtsinhaberin Janet Yellen eingeleitet hat”, hatten die Volkswirte der UniCredit vor kurzem prognostiziert. Yellen und ihre Kollegen haben die Zügel nach einer jahrelange Nullzinsphase angesichts des anhaltenden Aufschwungs in den USA stufenweise gestrafft - auf das aktuelle Leitzinsniveau von 1,0 bis 1,25 Prozent. Sie will es bis zum Jahresende weiter erhöhen, falls es die Konjunkturlage zulässt.

Experten hatten bereits in den vergangenen Tagen Powell als wahrscheinlichsten Kandidaten bezeichnet. Der Jurist und frühere Investmentbanker ist im Führungsgremium der einzige Republikaner - ebenso wie Trump. Da Powell wohl eher eine Linie wie Yellen fahren würde, die von den Demokraten mitgetragen wurde, gilt er als Kompromisskandidat, der bei in beiden politischen Lagern Anklang finden könnte. Zugleich ist er für eine Lockerung der Dodd-Frank-Gesetze offen: Dieses Regelwerk war die zentrale Lehre aus der Finanzkrise, in der Banken mit Steuermilliarden vor dem Aus bewahrt wurden.

Os preços dos alimentos dispararam desde que forças leais ao presidente sírio, Bashar al-Assad, assumiram o controle de vários bairros em maio e destruíram túneis que haviam sido usados para contrabandear comida para a área sitiada. Neste mês, elas fecharam o principal posto de verificação que dá acesso a Ghouta Oriental e impuseram um grande aumento nos impostos cobrados dos comerciantes.

Na semana passada, dois armazéns de alimentos foram saqueados, “um possível sinal de desespero crescente”, segundo o comunicado da ONU.

All four companies posted stellar quarterly earnings on Thursday, showing the strength of the shift in corporate computing away from company-owned data centers and to the cloud.

Microsoft’s Azure business nearly doubled, with year-over-year growth of 90 percent. The company does not break out revenue figures for Azure, but research firm Canalys estimates it generated $2 billion for Microsoft.

“The move to the cloud was one we felt Microsoft could always benefit from, and they’re showing us that they can,” said Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a portfolio management firm.

Highlighting the quarter for Microsoft was a deal securing retailer Costco (COST.O) as an Azure customer. That came just two months after the close of Amazon’s acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, which has heightened unease among retail and e-commerce companies about working with Amazon, said Ed Anderson, an analyst with Gartner.

Tim Green, analyst with the Motley Fool, said Amazon could find it needs to make changes at some point at Amazon Web services. “Spinning off AWS at some point down the road might become necessary to prevent an exodus of customers,” he said.

Amazon Web Services is still delivering far more revenue than any of its peers. For the quarter, AWS raked in nearly $4.6 billion -- a year-over-year increase of 42 percent. AWS may have missed out on Costco, but the company secured deals with Hulu, Toyota Racing Development, and most notably, General Electric.

Google Cloud Platform landed deals with the likes of department store retailer Kohl’s and payments processor PayPal. Like Microsoft, Alphabet does not break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but Canalys estimates the business generated $870 million in the quarter, up 76 percent year-over-year.

Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Google Cloud Platform is a top-three priority for the company. He said Google plans to continue expanding its cloud sales force.

Canalys estimates the cloud computing market at $14.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 43 percent from a year prior. Amazon holds 31.8 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft at 13.9 percent and Google with 6 percent, according to Canalys’ estimates.

The “cloud market will keep growing faster than most of the traditional information technology segment, as the market is still in the developing stage,” said Daniel Liu, research analyst with Canalys.

Reflecting the overall growth of the market was the strong performance by Intel, which sells processors and chips to cloud vendors. In July, Intel launched its new Xeon Scalable Processors, which drove 7 percent year-to-year growth for the company’s data center group.

The big three cloud vendors also benefit from the decision by many enterprises to build their applications using more than one cloud vendor. Retailers Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), for example, told Reuters they use a combination of cloud providers.

“Our philosophy here is to be cloud agnostic, as much as we can,” said Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot, which uses both Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

Some analysts expect cloud services growth to slow over time as competition increases.

Amazon, for instance, has said that price cuts and new products with lower costs on average are a core part of its cloud business. Additionally, Amazon Web Services saw usage growth outpacing that of revenue growth, said Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky.

“Going forward, cloud services will become more of a commodity, and the prices will quickly compress,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, an investment advisory service. “For now though, it’s a great business with plenty of room for all to grow.”",Cloud computing drives massive growth for big U.S. tech firms,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cloud-results/cloud-computing-drives-massive-growth-for-big-u-s-tech-firms-idUSKBN1CW05H

The Spanish football league’s president Javier Tebas was previously quoted as saying that, should Catalonia become independent, the region’s sides would not be able to compete in La Liga.

Valverde declined to comment on the possibility of that happening.

”Nothing has happened (in relation to Barcelona not being in La Liga) and we’re only talking about hypothetical situations,” he said.

“I have my own opinion but I just want to concentrate on sporting questions, especially because the political situation appears to change every half hour.”

In a bid to draw a line under Spain’s worst political crisis in 40 years, the government in Madrid on Friday sacked Catalonia’s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21.

In what appears to be a doomed gesture, the parliament had hours earlier declared independence following a referendum on secession that Spanish courts had ruled was illegal.

On the pitch, table-topping Barca confirmed that midfield playmaker Andres Iniesta would miss Saturday’s visit to Athletic Bilbao.

The club captain, who this week was named in the FIFPro Team of the Year, has a thigh strain and adds to a growing list of absentees for Valverde that also includes Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Arda Turan, Aleix Vidal and Thomas Vermaelen.

The news is not all negative, however, with full back Jordi Alba given the green light by the club’s medical staff to return to action.

Valverde joined Barca from Bilbao in the summer and will visit his former club as coach of the Catalans for the first time, insisting he will not allow emotion to get the better of him.

Under new guidelines for animal welfare, suppliers such as Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] must by 2024 meet new standards for the amount and brightness of light in chicken houses, provide access to perches that promote natural behavior among birds, and take other steps, according to McDonald‘s.

The fast-food chain said it will set targets for chickens’ health, including how well they walk and whether they have broken wings, and use third-party audits to ensure that farms comply. It will work with suppliers and technology companies to develop monitoring systems that automatically gather data on chickens’ behavior on farms.

Such requirements often raise costs for chicken producers because they must buy new equipment and retrofit chicken houses to comply. However, McDonald’s said it would not raise menu prices as a result.

Tyson and Cargill said they supported McDonald’s moves.

The requirements are the latest changes to affect McDonald’s menu that address consumers’ concerns about human and animal health. The company previously stopped buying chicken meat for U.S. restaurants from birds raised with antibiotics that are important to human health and said it would shift to using cage-free eggs in the U.S and Canada.

The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, where it gets most of its profit, after customers defected to fast-food rivals.

“While this might not be a direct impact on sales at McDonald‘s, it might help certain segments of our customer base make purchasing decisions that they might not have otherwise made,” Bruce Feinberg, a senior director for McDonald’s who works on meat products, said about the new standards.

Under the changes, McDonald’s also will buy chickens in the United States and Canada that have been rendered unconscious before slaughter with gas, instead of with electricity, a process some consider more humane.

The changes cover birds that account for more than 70 percent of McDonald’s global chicken supply, according to the company. It declined to reveal the number of chickens.

“I think it’s one of the most comprehensive programs that I’ve seen for chickens,” said livestock researcher Temple Grandin, who pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices and works with McDonald‘s.",McDonald's sets new welfare standards for chicken suppliers,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-chicken-standards/mcdonalds-sets-new-welfare-standards-for-chicken-suppliers-idUSKBN1CW2IL

Reuters reported this month that Tsai was in advanced talks to buy a stake in the Nets, which Tsai subsequently denied.

The deal values the U.S. basketball team at around $2.3 billion, the sources, who declined to speak for attribution because they are not permitted to speak to the press, said.

Under the terms of the deal, Tsai would have the option to buy a controlling interest in the next few years, the sources said.

A spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Nets declined to comment.

A deal would make the Brooklyn Nets the second NBA team to be worth more than $2 billion, demonstrating the increasing value of these teams as TV networks and advertisers pour money into live sports.

As more viewers choose to watch their favorite shows “on demand,” live sports still drive people to watch the games in real time - which is valued by advertisers who have time-sensitive promotions.

In September, American casino mogul Tilman Fertitta bought the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion, the highest price ever paid for an NBA team, according to media reports.",Alibaba's Tsai in deal for stake in NBA's Brooklyn Nets,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1CW2AU-OCASP

The report in the Sun newspaper follows dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein which have prompted hundreds of thousands of women around the world to share their own experiences.

The Sun said on Friday that female staff working in London’s Westminster political district had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.

It did not name anyone in connection with allegations but cited unnamed members of the group when describing its contents and purpose.

“The reports are very concerning, but I can’t pre-empt allegations or investigations that haven’t come to light yet,” May’s spokeswoman said when asked about the Sun story.

“The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behavior is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics.”

Separately, a group of women members of Britain’s opposition Labour Party have set up a website calling on fellow members who have experienced sexual harassment within party ranks to tell their stories anonymously to try and improve Labour’s culture.

Os certames ofereceram oito áreas no polígono do pré-sal, das quais três foram arrematadas por consórcios com a Petrobras como operadora, que ofereceram os maiores ágios ao definir o percentual de excedente em óleo a ser direcionado ao governo no futuro.

Na área do Entorno de Sapinhoá, o consórcio liderado pela Petrobras ofereceu ágio de quase 675 por cento, o maior do certame, seguido pelos lances, também com participação da estatal, de ágio de 454 por cento em Peroba e quase 255 por cento em Alto de Cabo Frio Central.

O forte interesse pela área do Entorno de Sapinhoá, no pré-sal de Santos, explica-se porque está adjacente a Sapinhoá, um dos maiores campos produtores de petróleo do Brasil, já operado pela Petrobras.

“O que nós observamos é que havia grandes empresas globais, com alto grau de interesse, e nessa situação não poderíamos nos dar ao luxo de perder essas oportunidades, por isso fomos no valor que estávamos autorizados a pagar”, disse Parente a jornalistas ao final da disputa.

Ele ressaltou, no entanto, a associação da companhia com grandes empresas globais, como a anglo-holandesa Shell, a britânica BP, as chinesas CNODC e a Repsol Sinopec, que evidenciariam a atratividade dos negócios no certame.

“Ganhamos essas participações com parceiros... realmente empresas de primeira grandeza, o que atesta também o valor do ágio (oferecido nos lances)”, disse Parente. Segundo o executivo, os investimentos nas áreas vão gerar “retorno adequado” para os acionistas e não irão impactar o planejamento financeiro da companhia.

“Todos investimentos estão nos limites do plano estratégico e do planejamento financeiro da companhia, é uma questão de priorização”, disse.

Ele defendeu, ainda, que a Petrobras foi “seletiva” nos leilões e optou pelas áreas com maior potencial, uma estratégia que deverá ser seguida também nas próximas licitações.

Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Google have in recent weeks said Russian operatives bought ads and used fake names on their services to spread divisive messages in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

On Tuesday, Twitter said it would add labels to election-related ads and say who is behind each of them, after a threat of regulation from the U.S. over the lack of disclosure for political spending on social media.

Twitter also accused two Russian media outlets of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism it had not done enough to deter international meddling.

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday.

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were “one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins” in the automaker’s North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company’s promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders.

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford’s new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects.

Ford’s share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV “in the sweet spot of the market” in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi’s U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi’s current lineup of SUVs “pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future,” Keogh said.

Renault SA (RENA.PA) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become “a significant contributor to our performance.”

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

“I‘m sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future,” he said.","Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ford-motor-results-tesla-analysis/wall-street-loves-electric-cars-america-loves-trucks-idUSKBN1CW0EZ

In the lawsuit filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, Weinstein said he needed the information to prevent the company, in which he and his brother remain the largest investors, from being harmed by unjustified legal settlements.

Representatives for Weinstein and The Weinstein Co did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Weinstein Co has been one of Hollywood’s most influential forces since its launch in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.”

The New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.

The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.

On Tuesday, an actress who accuses Weinstein of sexually assaulting her filed a negligence lawsuit against the company, saying it was aware Weinstein had previously settled other allegations of harassment and assault and should not have let her meet privately with the movie producer in a hotel room.

The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004.

The Los Angeles Police Department also said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

In Thursday’s lawsuit, Weinstein said he also wants to investigate whether confidential information was leaked to the press, if the Weinstein Company’s board and executives wrongly terminated him as chief executive, and if the board is pursuing a “fire sale” of the company, according to the complaint and attached exhibits.

“Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account -- which is the only one he used throughout the time he was employed by the company -- will contain information exonerating him, and therefore the company, from claims that may be asserted against them,” Weinstein’s lawyer wrote in an email to the Weinstein company, according to Thursday’s filing.

A Kurdish spokesman earlier said the two sides reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting which broke out on Oct. 16, after Iraqi forces seized the oil-city of Kirkuk.

Abadi ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept. 25 vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack.

The 24-hour truce “should allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas, including Fish-Khabur, and the international border”, Abadi said in a statement.

“This should prevent bloodshed between the children of the same country.”

He wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - call rejected by Baghdad.

According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region’s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 a.m. on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).

“The ceasefire is holding,” Vahal Ali, the director of KRG President Masoud Barzani’s media office, told Reuters.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also urged dialogue to start, in a call to Abadi, the Iraqi central government said in a statement on Friday morning.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

OIL REVENUE

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Kurdish Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds as the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur, and also south of their capital Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.

The spokesman of the U.S.-led anti Islamic State coalition in Baghdad, U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, told Reuters: “Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire.”

In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and “refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS”. “We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,” he added.

Iraqi forces on Thursday launched an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria.

Abadi has expressed hope the group will be completely defeated in Iraq before the end of the year.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

Islamic State’s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a gruelling battle which lasted nine months.

The militants’ Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces earlier this month.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed.

His remarks came before U.S. President Donald Trump - who has threatened to destroy the North if necessary - leaves on his first trip to Asia next week, including a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in.

For his part, Moon, after talks with Mattis, said the “aggressive deployment” of U.S. strategic assets in the region, which have included overflights by U.S. bombers, had been effective in deterring the North Korean threat.

Tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stoking fears any miscalculation could lead to an armed confrontation.

“North Korean provocations continue to threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council,” Mattis said in prepared remarks as he visited the demilitarized zone (DMZ).

“As Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear, our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”

Standing alongside Mattis, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo said: “We together will continue to defend peace through strong will and strong might.”

TRUMP VISIT LOOMS

Ahead of Trump’s visit to Asia, Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to the region.

“That’s really what it was all about – to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution,” Mattis said earlier this week after three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.

At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang and bolster the South’s defenses.

Washington’s top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with his South Korean counterpart, General Kyeong Doo Jeong, a U.S. military statement said. Dunford renewed U.S. warnings of retaliation to further provocations.

“(Dunford) reaffirmed that any attack by North Korea would be met with a response that will be overwhelming and effective, using the full range of U.S. military capabilities,” the statement said.

The United States flew Air Force bombers over waters east of North Korea last month in a show of force. The U.S. Navy, in what it says was a long-planned maneuver, will have three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups in the Pacific in the coming days.

Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.

U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize.

The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for “flagrant” human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad.

In a speech last month at the United Nations, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as “mentally deranged.”

Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.

“Do we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,” Mattis told reporters traveling with him this week.

“No one’s rushing for war.”

Separately, North Korea released a South Korean fishing boat which had been found to be in North Korean waters illegally, state media said.

The crew of 10 - seven South Koreans and three Vietnamese - were released on Friday evening, a spokesman for South Korea’s coastguard told Reuters. The return of the boat, which had been reported as missing from Saturday, may have eased already strained relations between North and South.

The deadly storm, which swamped the New York metropolitan area five years ago and revealed its vulnerability, convinced state officials to offer to buy out homeowners in flood-prone areas, including the Lettieris’ Oakwood Beach neighborhood.

At first, the Lettieris resisted. They had owned their nearly paid-off home since 1987, raised five children in it and spent $138,000 to rebuild after the storm sent a surge over the nearby beach that filled their first floor with seawater.

But eventually, like nearly 80 percent of their fellow Staten Island residents who were offered the same opportunity, they took the deal, part of a New York state program to convert the most vulnerable neighborhoods into uninhabited buffer zones.

“I wish we could have stayed, but we couldn‘t,” said Frank, remembering a 1992 storm that also flooded them out. “The writing was on the wall. We had to go.”

Sandy, a late-season hurricane, killed at least 159 people in New York, New Jersey and other parts of the East Coast on Oct. 29, 2012, including a father and son who drowned in the basement of their home next door to the Lettieris. It damaged or destroyed more than 650,000 homes.

Much of the impetus for the home buyout program was an expectation that storms like Sandy will become more common, according to Lisa Bova-Hiatt, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery.

“To say that extreme weather is not our new normal would just be incredibly short-sighted,” she said.

Rising sea levels will increase the average number of storms that flood New York City with surges of at least 7.4 feet (2.3 m) to once every five years by 2030 from once every 500 years before 1800, according to a Rutgers University study published on Tuesday.

BUFFER ZONE

Using money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, New York has spent $255 million to buy 654 properties, mostly in Staten Island, with 83 more in the pipeline, the Office of Storm Recovery said.

“The program is voluntary,” said Bova-Hiatt. “However, at some point it would be fantastic to have the entire area as a buffer zone.”

Bova-Hiatt, herself a Staten Island resident, said the state will never use its power of eminent domain to force out the Staten Islanders who declined buyout offers for 142 properties and can no longer accept them because the program has ended.

But she declined to predict whether New York City would seize property for a planned seawall to protect 5.5 miles (8.9 km) of Staten Island’s east coast.

New Jersey also has a buyout program, having spent $110 million from the federal government to buy 520 properties in areas that were hit by Sandy-related flooding, according to the State Department of Environmental Protection.

Two residents of Staten Island’s Oakwood Beach section who declined to sell are Gregory and Olga Epshteyn. Their two-story home is among 88 that the state failed to acquire out of the 402 in the neighborhood that were eligible.

“This is the best place on Staten Island to live,” said Gregory, adding that the city still diligently provides services, such as garbage pickup and street lights.

“We love it here, but we miss our neighbors,” Olga added.

The Epshteyns’ home now has plenty of open space around it as Oakwood Beach and two other storm-ravaged sections of Staten Island return to their natural states.

Most of the bungalows, townhouses and other modest homes that lined the neighborhood’s narrow streets have been torn down and covered over with grass that the state maintains.

On a recent visit, the Lettieris, both retired, said they missed Oakwood Beach, but did not regret their decision to take the state’s offer and move to higher ground about a mile (1.6 km) away.

Former residents often come back on the anniversary of Sandy and many are expected to visit on this Sunday’s five-year mark.

Yuriy Domashov recently moved to the edge of Oakwood Beach after taking the state buyout for his oceanfront townhouse in another flood-prone area a few miles up the beach.

“For all my life I was connected to the water,” said Domashov, a veteran of the Soviet navy, as he walked his dog near the beach.

Having survived the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster and an ordeal aboard his submarine, Domashov said he does not worry about another storm of the century.

“Once in 100 years, I believe, is good enough for me,” said Domashov, who is 75.",New York lets neighborhood return to nature to guard against storms,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storm-sandy/new-york-lets-neighborhood-return-to-nature-to-guard-against-storms-idUSKBN1CW19G

The 36-year-old Swede has not played since suffering a knee ligament injury in United’s Europa League quarter-final second leg match against Anderlecht at Old Trafford in April.

He watched his team mates lift the title in Europe’s second-tier competition and signed a one-year contract in the close season to prove his naysayers wrong.

“In the last years, when you’re thinking how many more years you are going to play, that is where you are hesitating. But the injury made it easy for me,” Ibrahimovic told former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry on Sky Sports Premier League.

”The challenge was that I never had a major injury, and all these people talking that ‘it’s over’ or ‘he’s too old’, all these doubts I had in my whole career... I had one target, and that is to come back and play the game.

“When that happens, it triggers me because it gives me energy and an objective. I‘m challenging what I am able to do, how far I can take my body.”

Ibrahimovic, who helped his club win the League Cup and the Community Shield and ended his debut season as the club’s top scorer with 28 goals in 46 appearances, stressed that his target was to help United win their 21st Premier League title.

”The target is the Premier League. That is my target to finish. Everything I started in the first season, we will finish in the second one.

”Everything I built up in the first season - obviously we won the three trophies - the ending for me was not the ending I wanted, or nobody wanted, especially after how the season went.

“I will walk out just as I came in, I will not walk out limping. I will walk out the way I want to walk out. Even if I have to walk on water I will do that also.”

Some lawmakers from states where state and local taxes are high and people benefit most from the federal income tax deduction are reluctant to contemplate such an elimination. It would be one of several measures aimed at offsetting lost revenue under sweeping tax cuts planned by President Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.

“We’re working with these lawmakers. We are making progress, but we aren’t there yet,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel. “I‘m hopeful at the end of the day we can find a good solution for them.”

A budget blueprint central to Republican efforts to enact the tax cut package - because it will enable easier passage of the package through the Senate - barely squeaked through the House on Thursday, with Democrats solidly opposed and a number of Republicans voting no in an effort to protect the deduction.

Brady also said lawmakers were exchanging ideas with Trump over how to handle 401(k) retirement savings plans.

In another measure to offset lost revenue, House Republicans have considered eliminating or capping the ability to contribute to the plans on a pre-tax basis, but Trump has said he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program.

“We want to increase the amount that you can give to your 401(k) or IRA (individual retirement account), for 401(k)s up to $20,000 or more,” Brady told Fox, without specifying whether that would be on a pre-tax or after-tax basis.

“We’re actually exchanging ideas with the president on how we help people save more and save sooner in their lives.”

The current cap on pre-tax 401(k) contributions is $18,000 a year, and that is set to rise to $18,500 next year.",Key U.S. House lawmaker sees progress allaying tax deduction concerns: Fox,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-deduction/key-u-s-house-lawmaker-sees-progress-allaying-tax-deduction-concerns-fox-idUSKBN1CW2CI?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

The Government Accountability Office said in a letter dated on Wednesday that it had accepted a request from Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker to investigate the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.

Trump established the panel in May after charging, without evidence, that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the November 2016 election. Most state election officials and election law experts say that U.S. voter fraud is rare.

Democrats and voting rights groups have criticized the panel, arguing it could be a vehicle for changes that would make it harder for lawful voters to cast ballots. A number of state governments have declined to hand over information about their voters to the White House.

In a letter last week to the GAO requesting the probe, the three senators said the commission, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence, had not responded to congressional requests for information about its activities. They said the panel’s lack of transparency could “unnecessarily diminish confidence in our democratic process.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the GAO’s decision to open an investigation.

The commission’s vice chair, Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in June to turn over voter information.

The data requested by Kobach included names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

Bloomberg News reported earlier on Friday that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell, citing three sources.

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact a big tax cut package. Warsh’s star also has faded, according to media accounts.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank position, which has dimmed prospects for him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

Congress had ordered in 1992 that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into Kennedy’s death should be fully opened to the public through the National Archives in 25 years, by Oct. 26, 2017, except for those the president authorized for further withholding.

Trump had confirmed on Saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once-classified records, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, “subject to the receipt of further information.”

But as the deadline neared, the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next 180 days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted.

The law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations, national defense, law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the public’s interest in full disclosure.

More than 2,800 uncensored documents were posted immediately to the National Archives website on Thursday evening - a staggering, disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators, scholars and conspiracy theorists.

The rest will be released “on a rolling basis,” with “redactions in only the rarest of circumstances,” by the end of the review on April 26, 2018, the White House said in a statement.

In a memo to government agency heads, Trump said the American people deserved as much access as possible to the records.

“Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” he wrote, adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now.

A Central Intelligence Agency spokesman told Reuters that every single one of approximately 18,000 remaining CIA records in the collection would ultimately be released, with just 1 percent of the material left redacted.

CIA Director Mike Pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the White House for keeping some materials secret, one senior administration official said.

While Kennedy was killed over half a century ago, the document file included material from investigations during the 1970s through the 1990s. Intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent “law enforcement equities” and other materials that still have relevance, the official said.

Trump was resistant but “acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months,” the official added.

QUELLING CONSPIRACY THEORIES?

Academics who have studied Kennedy’s slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the president’s open limousine that day in Dallas from an upper window of the Texas Book Depository building overlooking the motorcade route.

They likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old Democratic president’s killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents.

Of the roughly 5 million pages of JFK assassination-related records held by the National Archives, 88 percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late 1990s, and 11 percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted. Only about 1 percent have remain withheld in full, according to the National Archives.

Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy’s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, although they retain a powerful cultural currency.

“My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin,” said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College. “It’s hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history. But that’s where the evidence is.”

Kennedy’s assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s. He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.","Trump releases some JFK files, blocks others under pressure",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-jfk-release/trump-releases-some-jfk-files-blocks-others-under-pressure-idUSKBN1CV3KL?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Their celebration could be short lived. Credit-scoring agency Equifax had to drop its arbitration clause for 145.5 million consumers affected by a data breach disclosed in September, after public pressure and threats from state attorneys general. And after U.S. lender Wells Fargo opened 3.5 million unauthorized accounts for customers, a bipartisan group of lawmakers slammed the bank for wanting to settle disputes through arbitration.

Before the vote, the industry had been largely enjoying a respite from the wrath of Democrats and other critics in Washington. Wall Street wasn’t even mentioned in the Democratic platform for the 2018 midterm elections. Instead, the party focused on big tech companies like Facebook, questioning whether they need further antitrust regulations.

The Senate vote reignited their ire, with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling it “a giant wet kiss to Wall Street.” Bashing banks is also still in style among the populist base that elevated Donald Trump to the presidency.

GE is investing about $2.1 billion in GE Digital this year, and executives had said that amount would fall in 2018.

Flannery on Wednesday made his first direct remarks about the digital strategy since he became CEO on Aug. 1. He has begun slashing costs in other areas, including reducing staff, grounding corporate jets and axing the “Maserati benefit” of corporate cars for about 600 senior executives.

Flannery is due to unveil new financial targets on Nov. 13 and is under heavy pressure to turn GE around after the company’s third-quarter earnings and cash flow badly missed targets. GE stock is down 32 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up 14 percent,

GE’s digital strategy is built around a cloud-based software platform, known as Predix, that connects factories, power plants and other industrial equipment to computers that improve performance and predict outages.

But Predix’s limited capabilities and performance problems have caused GE to lose out to competitors such as Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and startups such as Uptake and C3IOT.

Flannery said on Wednesday that GE will focus on selling Predix in its own businesses: energy, oil-and-gas, aviation, healthcare, transportation and mining, as Reuters reported in August.

In other markets, “We’re going to be more selective ... and do it largely through partners,” Flannery said at GE’s annual Minds + Machines conference.

Gary Mintchell, chief executive of The Manufacturing Connection, an industrial-internet-focused research and consulting company, said GE’s strategy of using partners reflects the company’s realization that “they can’t build their own ecosystem.”

GE said it was expanding its partnership with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), to provide access to Microsoft applications on Predix. The specifics largely duplicated what the companies said when they first announced the deal in July 2016.

GE said Predix will be available on Azure in North America on Nov. 30, months later than the original target of the second quarter. Predix will still be available on Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services cloud platform, GE said.

GE Digital’s chief executive, Bill Ruh, on Wednesday noted a partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N). GE also is linking Predix with Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) IOS operating system for iPhones and iPads.

Patrick Franklin, vice president in charge of Predix, said there was still room to improve Predix after the company held a two-month time-out this year to fix bugs, but the platform was showing near-100 percent stability.

“We are paying careful attention to quality,” he said, referring to the delay in deploying Predix on Azure.

GE executives said the company is focusing on developing apps for Predix to boost sales. GE plans to bundle applications for equipment monitoring and service technicians, both of which it bought last year.

GE said orders for Predix were rising sharply. Some customers at the event echoed that view. U.S. utility Exelon Corp (EXC.N), for instance, said it is rolling out Predix to its nuclear, gas, wind and other power plants after a two-year pilot of the system showed it worked as advertised, said Brian Hoff, director of corporate strategy and innovation at Exelon.

Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.

Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.

In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.

Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.

Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”

At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.

Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.

But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal with Flynn is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.

Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, said his clients were not under investigation.

Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin.

In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”

Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.

Franks described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.

He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.

Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.

Kelner declined to comment for this story.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

SCRUTINY

The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.

Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.

Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.

“His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.

Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.

Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.

Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.

Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.

Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”

Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.

“The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.

Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.

Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.

“With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.","Exclusive: While advising Trump in 2016, ex-CIA chief proposed plan to discredit Turkish cleric",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-woolsey-exclusive/exclusive-while-advising-trump-in-2016-ex-cia-chief-proposed-plan-to-discredit-turkish-cleric-idUSKBN1CV2RF

Speaking after accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on a visit to the region, including Pakistan, Alice Wells said Washington looked forward to seeing practical steps from Pakistan “over the next few weeks and months.”

“The secretary stressed the importance of Pakistan moving quickly to demonstrate good faith and efforts to use its influence to create the conditions that will get the Taliban to the negotiating table,” Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters.

Wells said Pakistan’s long-standing relationships with militant organizations was a threat to its own stability and said the Taliban leadership and the allied Haqqani network still retained the ability to plan and recuperate and reside with their families in Pakistan.

She said Washington wanted Pakistan to show the same commitment it had made to defeat militant groups domestically to those threatening Afghanistan or India.

“It’s up to them whether or not they want to work with us,” Wells said. “And if they don’t ... then we’ll adjust accordingly.”

Wells declined to elaborate on what action the United States might take or what specific actions it wanted Pakistan to take.

Relations between uneasy allies United States and Pakistan have frayed in recent years, with Washington repeatedly accusing Islamabad of helping Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network militants who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so.

U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough with Pakistan unless it changed its behavior, with U.S. officials threatening further reductions in aid and mooting targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials.

On Monday, during a visit to Kabul, Tillerson urged Pakistan to act against safe havens on its soil.

Diplomats have sketched scenarios they fear could plunge transatlantic relations into crisis: a trade war, military conflict over North Korea, or the collapse of a Cold War-era arms treaty. They wonder if their post-war alliance can survive if any of them come true.

Since Trump took office nine months ago, governments in Berlin, Paris and London have wavered between alarm at his rhetoric and a shaky sense that his worst instincts can be contained by the “grown ups” in his cabinet and pressure from allies.

But the Iran decision, taken despite personal appeals from France’s Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Angela Merkel and Britain’s Theresa May, has changed the calculus in Europe, according to diplomats, politicians and analysts.

No longer is there an underlying confidence that Europe can muddle through three more years of Trump without fear of major, and possibly lasting, disruptions to the relationship. Nor is there faith that Trump, when the stakes are high, will listen to what his advisers and partners tell him.

The anxiety is especially acute in Germany, whose own identity is anchored in its relationship with the United States and whose reliance on Washington, particularly in defense and security matters, runs deeper than that of France or Britain.

“There is a sense of desperation in Berlin, a sense that Trump does not know what is at stake, that he doesn’t understand the historical factors that are at play here,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington and chairman of the Munich Security Conference.

“The transatlantic relationship is all about trust. In that sense, the Iran decision takes us to a new level. It is a breach of trust,” he said.

STANDING IN THE RUBBLE

Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran deal will not necessarily kill it. That depends on Congress, which must now decide to impose new sanctions against Tehran. But the consensus in Europe is that a landmark diplomatic achievement has been seriously undermined.

Merkel alluded to the breakdown in trust back in May, when she said Europe might not be able to rely on the United States and must take its fate into its own hands.

That came after a contentious G7 meeting in Sicily at which Trump ignored pleas from allies to stick with another multilateral agreement, the Paris climate accord.

Since then Merkel, focused on an election and efforts to form a coalition, has said little about the transatlantic relationship or Trump.

Macron meanwhile, has done his best to charm the American president, inviting him to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations and meeting him again at the United Nations last month.

“I don’t despair of making him change his mind,” Macron said in New York of Trump’s stances on climate and Iran.

In private however, European officials say they are worried that Trump’s rejection of the Iran deal could be a harbinger of other disruptive salvos from Washington.

One senior European diplomat said the next conflict would likely be over trade, describing Trump’s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- and his threats to abandon it -- as a “litmus test”.

European firms, especially German carmakers who produce in Mexico and export to the United States, could be hit hard by a breakdown of NAFTA.

There are also fears that Trump could carry out a threat to introduce steel import tariffs, which would hit European exporters as well as the Chinese.

“So far there has been a lot of bark and no bite from Trump on trade, but that doesn’t mean it will stay that way,” said the European diplomat. “We have to be prepared for real protectionist measures. Any steps that penalize European firms directly or indirectly would create a downward spiral.”

ANTI-AMERICANISM

North Korea is another area of concern. Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, believes the reaction in Europe to a military conflict on the Korean peninsula could be “as messy as the Iraq war”.

The European public could view Washington as the aggressor in such a conflict. This could fuel anti-American sentiment, making it difficult for European leaders to stand with Trump and emboldening voices that are already calling for a break from Washington -- no matter how unrealistic that looks in practice.

“We have to wake up to the fact that we may be dealing with Trump for some time, and that there may not be a correction when he leaves,” one German diplomat told Reuters. “It hasn’t dawned on people here that this is existential and you have to react.”

Concerns about such sentiments led a group of a dozen Germany-based foreign policy experts to issue a manifesto this month, entitled “In Spite of It All, America”, which warned Berlin against turning its back on Washington because of Trump.

Former ambassador Ischinger shares that view. But he too is concerned the relationship could deteriorate further.

One of his biggest fears is a collapse of the INF Treaty, a nuclear arms reduction pact signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Washington and Moscow accuse each other of violating the treaty and Gorbachev himself warned this month that it was in peril.

Should the INF unravel, Ischinger believes the divisive 1980s debate about deploying nuclear weapons in Europe could resurface with devastating consequences for transatlantic ties.

“All hell could break loose, politically speaking,” he said.

For generations of Germans, Ischinger says, the symbol of the transatlantic alliance has been U.S. presidents -- from John F. Kennedy to Reagan, and from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama.

“I can no longer tell my children that they are part of this alliance with Trump as president,” he said. “It is rather sad. I don’t know how the loss of this symbol can be replaced.”","After Iran shock, nervous Europe girds for next Trump salvo",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-usa-analysis/after-iran-shock-nervous-europe-girds-for-next-trump-salvo-idUSKBN1CW1KF

(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co film company on Thursday was sued by its founder and former co-chairman Harvey Weinstein who is seeking information that could help defend himself against sexual assault allegations, and also help defend the company against potential liability.

In the lawsuit filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, Weinstein said he needed the information to prevent the company, in which he and his brother remain the largest investors, from being harmed by unjustified legal settlements.

Representatives for Weinstein and The Weinstein Co did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Weinstein Co has been one of Hollywood’s most influential forces since its launch in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.”

The New York Times reported earlier this month that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.

The New Yorker magazine reported that 13 women had claimed that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.

On Tuesday, an actress who accuses Weinstein of sexually assaulting her filed a negligence lawsuit against the company, saying it was aware Weinstein had previously settled other allegations of harassment and assault and should not have let her meet privately with the movie producer in a hotel room.

The New York City Police Department has said it is investigating an allegation of sexual assault by Weinstein in 2004.

The Los Angeles Police Department also said earlier this month that it is investigating a 2013 sexual assault allegation against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

In Thursday’s lawsuit, Weinstein said he also wants to investigate whether confidential information was leaked to the press, if the Weinstein Company’s board and executives wrongly terminated him as chief executive, and if the board is pursuing a “fire sale” of the company, according to the complaint and attached exhibits.

“Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account -- which is the only one he used throughout the time he was employed by the company -- will contain information exonerating him, and therefore the company, from claims that may be asserted against them,” Weinstein’s lawyer wrote in an email to the Weinstein company, according to Thursday’s filing.

Brazil awarded six of the eight blocks on offer in the auction for the rights to pump oil from the country’s coveted pre-salt region, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped below thousands of feet of salt in the country’s Atlantic waters.

The wins will bolster Shell’s position as the largest foreign operator in Brazil’s offshore oil sector, second only to state-run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) (PETR4.SA).

The Anglo-Dutch oil major won one area in consortium with France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), another with Petrobras and Repsol-Sinopec, and a third with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) and China’s CNOOC.

Shell has said it is confident it can pump from the pre-salt fields at below $40 a barrel.

Rival BP Plc (BP.L), which is active in Brazil but not yet producing oil, took two more blocks on Friday.

“We see the government of Brazil being more supportive of foreign companies entering Brazil,” BP Latin America President Felipe Arbelaez said after the rounds.

“There are high quality assets. We believe that the assets here will be resilient in any price environment.”

Brazil earned 6.15 billion reais ($1.88 billion) in signing bonuses for the six fields that it awarded in the auction.

President Michel Temer’s government has enacted reforms to make the energy sector more attractive to foreign investment, and for the first time international oil firms will be allowed to operate fields in the pre-salt.

Countries worldwide sitting on oil and gas reserves are keen to pump it before it becomes less valuable as global policies to address climate change kick in.

The opposition in Brazil has opposed some of the reforms, and the auction was delayed by three hours on Friday after a federal judge issued an injunction to suspend the process at the behest of the leftist Workers Party.

That left top executives from the world’s largest oil companies milling around in the hotel that hosted the auction, in an upscale seaside neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.

EXXON

In a twist, U.S. major Exxon Mobil, whose 10-block win in last month’s Brazilian auction was seen by many as a prelude to a big play on Friday, took just one block as part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil ASA (STL.OL) and Portugal’s Petrogal [PETP.UL], a unit of Galp Energia (GALP.LS). Two blocks got no bids.

The quality of reserves and the reforms have made Brazil an important target for oil majors, even though they have had less appetite for capital-intensive mega projects since crude prices crashed in 2014.

Brazil has high hopes for the volume of oil the companies can pump from the blocks. Brazilian oil output could double to more than 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, compared with the 2.6 million bpd produced in August, regulator ANP said on Thursday.

Last season City won the first six Premier League games and were being prematurely crowned champions in some quarters before ending up third.

This time they have won eight and drawn one of the first nine matches to lead the table by five points, as well as maintaining a 100 percent record after three Champions League ties.

Requiring a penalty shootout to beat Championship (second tier) club Wolverhampton Wanderers in the League Cup on Tuesday was a reminder that nothing should be taken for granted, said Guardiola.

“You realise last Tuesday how difficult it is to win games,” he told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s visit to West Bromwich Albion.

”Just be calm and be focussed. We are in October.

“We have good results, we go game by game. We will analyse at the end of the season. We are okay but it is the same as last season.”

There was short shrift too for a question about the possibility of going the whole season unbeaten, as Arsenal did in the Premier League in 2003-04.

“I answered that in the last press conference. Forget about it,” the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager said.

He was more impressed by the fact that if City do not lose this weekend, forward Gabriel Jesus will have gone a year without losing a game for club or country.

“Wow. What a record. Amazing,” Guardiola said.

He was also pleased to report that Vincent Kompany, who has been to see a specialist in Barcelona, will return to training in the next week or 10 days.

The company’s shares, which have fallen steadily since it announced in early September it would launch two iPhones within two months, rose nearly 3 percent in response.

Pre-orders for the much-anticipated 10th anniversary phone started from 12.01 am PT (0701 GMT) on Friday.

“We can see from the initial response, customer demand is off the charts,” an Apple spokeswoman told Reuters.

“We’re working hard to get this revolutionary new product into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible.”

The company’s website showed delivery times pushed out to five to six weeks for the phone, compared to an initial plan of Nov. 3.

IPhone X’s launch follows weeks of concerns among analysts about the production of the new phone, which for the first time includes new facial identification software to replace the fingerprint used on previous phones.

Analysts have cautioned that production of the phone was below target, due to difficulties in producing the TrueDepth camera system, which houses sophisticated cameras and sensors making it possible to unlock the phone using Face ID.

Wireless carriers in the United States and Canada have reported slow third-quarter customer upgrades. While some expect a pickup after the iPhone X goes on sale in November, others cautioned that phone’s $999 price tag could weigh on demand.

Major promotions on the iPhone X from U.S. carriers have yet to materialize, and in some cases, the offers have been even less generous than what was available for the iPhone 8, said Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in a research note on Thursday.

He noted that Sprint Corp’s iPhone X promotion of $350 in savings for trading in an eligible device was the most aggressive but still lower than what it offered for last year’s launch of the iPhone 7.

Infantino also confirmed that FIFA will officially recognise as world club champions the winners of the old Intercontinental Cup dating back to 1960 - a contest that became notorious for some of the most unsavoury matches in the sport.

FIFA currently organises a Club World Cup every year, featuring the champion clubs of each continent, but it has recently suffered from European dominance with teams from other regions unable to mount a serious challenge.

“The current Club World Cup is a nice competition but it has not really had the impact that was hoped in development of club football around the world,” Infantino told a media conference following a FIFA Council meeting.

“We have to see if we can come up with something special, something new which will help club football and confederations all around the world.”

“When FIFA organises a competition, it should be something special, so either we find a special tournament or we’d rather not do it.”

But Infantino stressed that it was important not to further congest the international calendar.

“One option could be to organise it instead of the Confederations Cup,” he said.

The Club World Cup has been held in its current form since 2005. Before that, from 1980 to 2004, a single match was played between the champions of Europe and South America in Tokyo.

That in turn was preceded by the so-called Intercontinental Cup, which also featured European and South American champions and was played over two legs, with one match on each continent.

The 41-year-old professional golfer was found asleep in May behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz, which was parked alongside a road not far from his home on Jupiter Island.

Woods entered his plea and accepted the conditions, including 12 months of probation, by responding to questions from Florida Circuit Judge Sandra Bosso-Pardo. He will now enter a diversion program offered in Palm Beach County for first-time DUI offenders.

Woods is eligible for the program since he had no prior criminal record, cooperated with police and was not involved in a crash, said Dave Aronberg, state attorney for the 15th Judicial Circuit of Florida.

Woods has already completed 50 hours of community service as part of the program, said Aronberg.

“This particular plea agreement has no jail time,” Bosso-Pardo told Woods during the hearing. “However, if you violate your probation in any significant way, I could revoke your probation and sentence you to jail for 90 days. Is that understood?”

Woods replied: “Yes.”

The hearing lasted only a few minutes. Woods, dressed in a charcoal gray suit and a gray T-shirt, did not answer questions shouted by reporters as he left the courthouse in Palm Beach Gardens and was driven away in a black SUV.

Woods told police officers at the time of his arrest that he was returning from Los Angeles, but could not remember where he was going, even though his car was headed away from his home, the arrest report showed.

Woods had five drugs in his system when he was arrested, but no alcohol, according to a toxicology report. Those drugs included generic forms of the painkillers Vicodin and Dilaudid; the mood drug Xanax; the sleeping pill Ambien, and a drug that contained THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

If Woods completes the program, the reckless driving charge will be expunged from his record. But if he is arrested again for DUI, he will be treated as a second-time offender, Aronberg said.

In a statement after his arrest, Woods apologized to fans and blamed the incident on prescription medication he was taking to manage pain from a recent back surgery.

Woods, who is second on the all-time list with 14 major men’s golf titles, has not won a major championship since 2008.

In 2009, he was involved in a bizarre early-morning car crash outside his home near Orlando.

A Kurdish spokesman earlier said the two sides reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting which broke out on Oct. 16, after Iraqi forces seized the oil-city of Kirkuk.

Abadi ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept. 25 vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack.

The 24-hour truce “should allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas, including Fish-Khabur, and the international border”, Abadi said in a statement.

“This should prevent bloodshed between the children of the same country.”

He wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil.

The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and “starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution” - call rejected by Baghdad.

According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region’s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 a.m. on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).

“The ceasefire is holding,” Vahal Ali, the director of KRG President Masoud Barzani’s media office, told Reuters.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also urged dialogue to start, in a call to Abadi, the Iraqi central government said in a statement on Friday morning.

U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country.

OIL REVENUE

The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Kurdish Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region.

The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds as the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region’s oil export revenue.

The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur, and also south of their capital Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides.

Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was “disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution” and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG “overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution”.

Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks. “We won’t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,” he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran.

The spokesman of the U.S.-led anti Islamic State coalition in Baghdad, U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, told Reuters: “Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire.”

In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and “refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS”. “We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,” he added.

Iraqi forces on Thursday launched an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria.

Abadi has expressed hope the group will be completely defeated in Iraq before the end of the year.

The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.

Islamic State’s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, in a gruelling battle which lasted nine months.

The militants’ Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces earlier this month.

Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed.

People walk past the Bank of England in London, Britain, October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs in the coming week for the first time in more than 10 years. But is the country really ready?

The consensus is for rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

That 0.25 percent was where the BoE put Bank Rate just over a year ago, shortly after British voters elected to leave the European Union. And there’s the rub: the uncertainty the vote triggered is still there.

A Reuters poll published in the past week showed more than 70 percent of economists believe now is not the time to raise rates -- though slightly more than that said it would happen anyway. [BOE/INT]

BoE Governor Mark Carney has made it clear a hike is in the offing, if not specifically saying at this coming meeting.

His concern is that low unemployment means Britain’s economy has little spare capacity and, accordingly, faces upward inflation pressure. Added to that are moves by other major central banks to rein in loose monetary policy, which could also push inflation higher by weakening the pound further.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again. The European Central Bank is cutting back on its bond buying, albeit gently.

So the BoE needs to concern itself with a pressured pound and high employment driving up inflation that, at 3 percent, is already well above target and the highest in the Group of Seven industrialized nations.

But ranged against that is huge political and economic uncertainty over how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will play out.

Companies are unclear about what to plan for, ranging from little short-term change to a complete revolution in how they do business.

Consumers too are wary as, while Britain’s economy has by no means not gone over a cliff, it has had some wobbles.

Retail sales, for example, contracted on a monthly basis in September and were up 1.2 percent year-on-year versus 4.1 percent a year earlier.

Preliminary third-quarter growth figures in the past week, meanwhile, were slightly better than expected. But at 1.5 percent year-on-year they are well below pre-Brexit vote levels and significantly lag both the United States and the euro zone.

This had prompted some economists to suggest Carney and the BoE are about to “do a Trichet” -- mirroring then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet’s raising of rates in 2008 just as the financial crisis was hitting.

Former BoE policymaker Danny Blanchflower - who voted against the BoE’s last hike in 2007, and has been regularly critical of suggestions to tighten policy since - has been scathing about the idea of a UK hike now.

“Nothing in data whatsoever says there should be a rate rise,” he tweeted.

(NOT) RISING SUN

The BoE is not the only central bank discussing policy. The Bank of Japan will announce its decisions on Tuesday.

Deflation -- Japan’s biggest economic problem for much of the past 20 years -- is over, but inflation is far from entrenched, limping along at just 0.7 percent year-on-year.

The economy too is somewhat off the pace, with the International Monetary Fund predicting 1.5 percent growth this year, though that is an improvement from 2016.

The biggest issue among economists with regard to the BoJ is whether it should reveal its plans to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy.

“We are anticipating few major changes in monetary policy,” Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at SuMi TRUST, wrote in a note. “The medium-term outlook for the Japanese economy is largely unchanged since the last policy meeting so the BoJ is likely to maintain the status quo.”

Underlining this, Reuters polls suggest the BoJ won’t start rolling back its monetary stimulus until late next year at the earliest -- the sort of unclouded policy outlook that the BoE’s Carney might arguably have cause to envy before the week is out.",Place your bets for the Brexit rate hike,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-economy-outlook/global-economy-place-your-bets-for-the-brexit-rate-hike-idINKBN1CW1RJ

Repeated delays to the poll, originally scheduled for late 2016, have led to unrest and raised fears the Central African nation could slip back to the wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.

U.S. envoy Nikki Haley, who met with the Congolese electoral commission (CENI) during a visit to Kinshasa, told reporters she had passed on a message that “these elections must take place in 2018 or there will be no support for the electoral process”.

“The president must say that we’re going to have elections in 2018,” Haley said ahead of a later meeting with Kabila. “Every day we don’t have elections in this country someone dies.”

The electoral commission had said earlier this month that the vote to replace Kabila could not take place until April 2019 at the earliest, leading the opposition to warn that the population would “take matters into its own hands”.

Dozens died in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. The resulting political crisis has also contributed to rising militia violence in Congo’s east and center.

Kabila, who has ruled Congo since his father’s assassination in 2001, says the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters.

However, his opponents accuse him of using the delay to maneuver to remove term limits that prevent him from standing for re-election, as presidents in neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic have done. He denies those charges.

Congo government spokesman Lambert Mende said the government hoped to see the election as soon as possible but that it was up to the electoral commission to set the date.

“It’s not up to the government, nor to Ms. Haley to organize the elections,” Mende said. “I don’t think that we can be subjected to these kinds of diktats.”

International donors have said they are prepared to provide significant funding to elections but are waiting for a realistic calendar from CENI.

“This epidemic is a national health emergency,” Trump, a Republican, said at the White House.
A White House commission on the drug crisis had urged Trump to declare a national emergency.

They said they determined that a public health emergency declaration was most appropriate after an expansive review.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, stopping short of a national emergency declaration he promised months ago that would have freed up more federal money.

Responding to a growing problem, particularly in rural areas, Trump’s declaration will redirect federal resources and loosen regulations to combat opioid abuse, senior administration officials said.

But it does not result in more money to combat the crisis. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said the declaration was meaningless without additional funding.

Republican lawmakers called the president’s declaration an important step in combating the crisis.

“This epidemic is a national health emergency,” Trump, a Republican, said at the White House. “As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.”

Trump, who also called the epidemic a “national shame” and “human tragedy,” was introduced by his wife, Melania, who said she had made fighting the epidemic one of her top priorities as first lady. “This can happen to any of us,” she said.

The president also made a personal reference to addiction in his family by citing his deceased brother Fred, an alcoholic whose advice not to imbibe made an impression on Trump, who does not drink alcohol.

The announcement disappointed some advocates and experts in the addiction fight, who said it was inadequate to fight a scourge that played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death rate has kept rising, estimates show.

Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, are fueling the drug overdoses. More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC.

A White House commission on the drug crisis had urged Trump to declare a national emergency. On Wednesday, the president told Fox Business Network he would do so.

Officials told reporters on the conference call that Federal Emergency Management Agency funds that would have been released under a national emergency are already exhausted from recent storms that struck Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.

The administration would have to work with Congress to help provide additional funding to address drug abuse, they added. They said they determined that a public health emergency declaration was most appropriate after an expansive review.

Under Thursday’s declaration, treatment would be made more accessible for abusers of prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, while ensuring fewer delays in staffing the Department of Health and Human Services to help states grapple with the crisis.

‘BAD ACTORS’

Trump said he would discuss stopping the flow of fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Asia next month.

In his remarks, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service and Department of Homeland Security were “strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China.”

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had always paid a great deal of attention to international cooperation against narcotics and had listed 23 components of fentanyl as controlled substances, despite not having a fentanyl abuse problem.

Trump added he would consider bringing lawsuits against “bad actors” in the epidemic. Several states have sued opioid manufacturers for deceptive marketing. Congress is investigating the business practices of manufacturers.

The president also said the government should focus on teaching young people not to take drugs. “There is nothing desirable about drugs. They’re bad,” he said.

Thursday’s declaration allows the Department of Labor to issue grants to help dislocated workers affected by the crisis. HIV/AIDS health funding would also be prioritized for those who need substance abuse treatment, officials said.

As a candidate, Trump promised to address the crisis, including by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to stop the flow of illicit drugs, which he touched on in his speech.

Additional actions under the move would be announced in coming weeks by various agencies, officials said.",Trump declares opioids a U.S. public health emergency,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-opioids-emergency/trump-declares-opioids-a-u-s-public-health-emergency-idUSKBN1CV1XF

The S&P technology index led the way higher, up 3.14 percent. The index was on track for its best day since March 1, 2016 and is up nearly 35 percent on the year versus the 15.2 percent gain in the S&P 500.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.30 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 7.16 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services.

Further lifting the sector were shares of Apple (AAPL.O), which rose 3.83 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. Intel (INTC.O) soared 8.10 percent after its quarterly results topped estimates and the chipmaker raised its full-year forecasts.

Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.15 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Its gains helped lift the consumer discretionary sector 1.53 percent to put the index on pace for its best daily performance since Dec. 7.

“People are concerned about overvaluation, people are concerned about what is the catalyst for those guys to attract too much attention from regulators,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

“They are the ones that everyone wants to own, has to own because they are the ones reporting the best earnings. They definitely came through, that is very positive.”

Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a 3-percent annual rate, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities.

A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank provided support for stocks. In Powell’s potential appointment, investors see a continuation of the current monetary policy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 23,436.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.22 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,581.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 147.33 points, or 2.25 percent, to 6,704.10.

Earnings growth for the third quarter is now 6.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 273 companies that have posted earnings, 74 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 72 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Not all earnings were positive, however. Chevron’s (CVX.N) 4.53 percent fall weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil company’s profit missed estimates.

Merck (MRK.N) dropped 6.58 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs.

Picture taken October 21, 2017. REUTERS/Maria Tsvetkova

The document, a death certificate issued by the Russian consulate in Damascus dated Oct. 4, 2017, does not say what the deceased was doing in Syria.

But Reuters has established in interviews with the families and friends of some of the deceased and officials in their hometowns that the dead included Russian private military contractors killed while fighting alongside the forces of Moscow’s ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The presence of the Russian contractors in Syria - and the casualties they are sustaining - is denied by Moscow, which wants to portray its military intervention in Syria as a successful peace mission with minimal losses.

The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters. Requests for comment from the Russian consulate in Damascus did not elicit a response.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement provided to Reuters on Friday: “We do not have information about individual citizens who visit Syria. With that, I consider this question dealt with.”

Reuters sent questions to a group of Russian private military contractors active in Syria through a person who knows their commanders, but did not receive a response.

The official death toll of military personnel in Syria this year is 16. A casualty figure significantly higher than that could tarnish President Vladimir Putin’s record five months before a presidential election which he is expected to contest.

A Reuters count of the number of Russian private contractors known to have been killed in Syria this year, based on interviews with relatives and friends of the dead and local officials in their hometowns, stands at 26.

Russian authorities have not publicly released any information this year about casualties among Russian civilians who may have been caught up in the fighting.

The Russian Foreign Ministry, in response to Reuters questions, said the consulate in Syria was fulfilling its duties to register the deaths of Russian citizens. It said that under the law, personal data obtained in the process of registering the deaths was restricted and could not be publicly disclosed.

In August, Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defense ministry spokesman, said in response to a previous Reuters report that information about Russian military contractors in Syria was “a myth”, and that Reuters was attempting to discredit Moscow’s operation to restore peace in Syria.

UNUSUAL

A Russian diplomat who has worked in a consulate in another part of the world, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the figure of 131 registered deaths in nine months was unusually high given the estimated number of Russian expatriates in Syria.

Although there is no official data for the size of the community, data from Russian national elections shows there were only around 5,000 registered Russian voters in the country in 2012 and 2016.

“It is as if the diaspora is dying out,” he said.

High numbers of deaths are usually recorded by Russian consulates only in tourist destinations such as Thailand or Turkey, he said.

Russian consulates do not register the deaths of military personnel, according to an official at the consulate in Damascus who did not give his name.

The consular document seen by Reuters was a “certificate of death” issued to record the death of Sergei Poddubny, 36. It was one of three death certificates seen by Reuters.

Poddubny’s certificate, which bears the consulate’s stamp, lists the cause of death as “carbonization of the body” - in other words, he was burned.

It said he was killed on Sept. 28 in the town of Tiyas, Homs province, the scene of heavy fighting between Islamist rebels and pro-Assad forces. Several Russian contractors were killed in the area earlier this year, friends and relatives told Reuters.

Poddubny’s body was repatriated and buried in his home village in southern Russia about three weeks later. He had been in Syria as a private military contractor, one of his relatives and one of his friends told Reuters.

Poddubny’s death certificate had a serial number in the top right corner, 131.

Under a Justice Ministry procedure, all death certificates are numbered, starting from zero at the start of the year and going up by one digit for each new death recorded.

The Russian diplomat confirmed that is the procedure.

Reuters saw two other certificates, both issued on Feb. 3. The numbers - 9 and 13 - indicate certificates for at least five deaths were issued on that day. They were both private military contractors, according to people who know them.

The death of a Russian citizen would have to be registered at the consulate in order to repatriate the body back to Russia via civilian channels, according to the Russian diplomat.

A death certificate from the consulate would also help with bureaucracy back home relating to the dead person’s assets, the diplomat said.

The bodies of Russians fighting on the rebel side are not repatriated, according to a former Russian official who dealt with at least six cases of Russians killed in Syria and the relatives of four Russian Islamists killed there.

A few thousand Russian citizens with Islamist sympathies have traveled to rebel-held areas since the conflict began in 2011, according to Russian officials.",Exclusive: Death certificate offers clues on Russian casualties in Syria,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-russia-syria-casualtie/exclusive-death-certificate-offers-clues-on-russian-casualties-in-syria-idUKKBN1CW1LO

Shares of Aetna, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, were marginally up in early trading on Friday, after closing 12 percent higher on Thursday following reports of the deal. CVS Health was down about 1 percent.

CVS Health has made an offer to acquire No. 3 U.S. health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or over $66 billion, making it the biggest deal of the year, Reuters reported on Thursday.

“A potential combination would diversify CVS profit streams ahead of an Amazon entry and set the stage for a new healthcare-retail delivery model,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

Amazon.com Inc’s speculated entry has hit shares of most drugstore operators on fears that the online retailer would leverage its vast ecommerce platform to take market share from traditional pharmacies.

“We believe CVS does need to respond to the potential threat and strike a different path,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee said in a note.

A deal would make CVS-Aetna a one-stop shop for customers’ health care needs - ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores.

The vertical integration of retail pharmacy, PBM, and insurers fits with broader healthcare themes of expanded access, consumerism and cost reduction, Jefferies analysts said, adding that the deal chatter was not a complete surprise.

“It would address each company’s need for a fresh script.”

Some analysts said the deal could also trigger a wave of consolidation across the industry.

It could be a possible catalyst for higher health insurance sector valuation, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Bosch said, adding that WellCare Health Plans, Humana and Centene could be possible acquisition targets.

PTI candidate Arbab Amir Ayub clinched 45,631 votes, about 34.8 percent of the total, on Thursday to ensure PTI kept the parliamentary seat in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) that it governs.

The by-election was seen as a litmus test of PTI’s popularity in KP, where it has focused on police, health and education reforms in contrast to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party betting on road and energy infrastructure projects.

Khan, the PTI chairman, touted the victory as a “direct vote of confidence” in his party’s performance governing KP since the 2013 election, when it won the National Assembly seat, known as Peshawar NA-4, with a majority of about 40 percent.

The next general election is due in mid-2018 but Khan has called for early polls after PML-N leader and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was toppled in July by a Supreme Court disqualification over an undeclared source of income.

Analysts say Khan’s chances of becoming prime minister have been boosted by Sharif’s ouster, and the sportsman has doubled down on his populist message by saying he will pull the country away from infrastructure spending towards improving schools, hospitals and the lives of the poor.

“Most of the youngsters like Imran Khan and believe he can steer the country out of crisis and stop corruption,” said Zahid Hussain, a government contractor.

Awami National Party (ANP) candidate Khushdil Khan secured 24,830 votes, or 18.9 percent of the total, to pip PML-N’s Nasir Khan Musazai, who won 23,169 votes to finish third.

Khushdil Khan’s showing will hearten the ANP, whose candidates barely campaigned in 2013 as the Pakistani Taliban targeted and killed many of its leaders and activists in KP.

But it was the performance of two new hardline religious parties that caught the eye of political observers.

Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni, a candidate for the Tehreek-i-Labaik party, won 7.6 percent of the ballot campaigning on a platform of support for Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws that are already some of the world’s harshest.

Labaik supporters have spread their hardline message, including the notion that those who commit blasphemy against Islam should be killed, through mosques and seminaries.

Syed Moharram Shah, a Labaik activist, said the party was surprised it captured 9,060 votes because it wasn’t fully prepared for the election.

“This is our first attempt but look at people’s response. It’s very much encouraging,” he said.

Alhaj Liaqat Ali Khan, an independent candidate backed by the Milli Muslim League (MML) party, loyal to Hafiz Saeed, an Islamist under house arrest, obtained 3,557 votes.

Washington accuses Saeed of being the mastermind behind the 2008 attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people, and has placed a $10 million bounty on his head. Saeed denies the charge.

Although the Catalan declaration appears to be a doomed gesture, both sides’ moves take Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades to a new and possibly dangerous level.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for calm and said the rule of law would be restored in Catalonia, where secessionists have long cherished the dream of a separate nation.

A crowd of more than 2,000 independence supporters gathered in the Ciutadella Park outside the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting “Liberty” in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through.

The motion passed in the parliament after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of “President!” and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem “Els Segadors” (The Reapers).

“Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever”, Puigdemont said on Twitter.

But immediately after news of the vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil in the wealthy region.

Within an hour, the upper house of Spain’s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy’s government to rule Catalonia directly -- an unprecedented move in Spain since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.

The United States, Britain, France and Germany also swiftly dismissed the declaration and expressed support for Rajoy’s efforts to keep Spain united.

FIRING THE GOVERNMENT?

Rajoy’s cabinet was meeting on Friday evening to adopt the first measures to govern Catalonia. This could include firing the Barcelona government and assuming direct supervision of Catalan police forces.

“Exceptional measures should only be adopted when no other remedy is possible,” Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an address to the Senate on Friday morning.

“In my opinion there is no alternative. The only thing that can be done and should be done is to accept and comply with the law,” said Rajoy, who has staked out an uncompromising position.

How direct rule would work on the ground - including the reaction of civil servants and the police - is uncertain. Some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow “peaceful resistance”.

“Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,” Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.

“Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.”

The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. National flags now hang from many balconies in the capital in an expression of unity.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.

The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

NOT EASY

“It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be free, it is not going to change in a day. But there is no alternative to a process towards the Catalan Republic,” lawmaker Marta Rovira of the Junts pel Si pro-independence alliance said in a debate leading to the vote.

After the debate, lawmakers from members of three main national parties -- the People’s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos -- walked out. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favor in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them.

Spain’s constitutional court said it was reviewing the vote. The state prosecutor and other parties have three days to open a case.

Montserrat Rectoret, a 61-year-old historian, was among the crowds in Barcelona.

“I am emotional because Catalonia has struggled for 40 years to be independent and finally I can see it,” she said.","Catalonia declares independence from Spain, direct Madrid rule looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/catalonia-declares-independence-from-spain-direct-madrid-rule-looms-idUSKBN1CW0VF?il=0

The S&P technology index led the way higher, up 3.14 percent. The index was on track for its best day since March 1, 2016 and is up nearly 35 percent on the year versus the 15.2 percent gain in the S&P 500.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.30 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 7.16 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services.

Further lifting the sector were shares of Apple (AAPL.O), which rose 3.83 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. Intel (INTC.O) soared 8.10 percent after its quarterly results topped estimates and the chipmaker raised its full-year forecasts.

Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.15 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Its gains helped lift the consumer discretionary sector 1.53 percent to put the index on pace for its best daily performance since Dec. 7.

“People are concerned about overvaluation, people are concerned about what is the catalyst for those guys to attract too much attention from regulators,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

“They are the ones that everyone wants to own, has to own because they are the ones reporting the best earnings. They definitely came through, that is very positive.”

Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a 3-percent annual rate, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities.

A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank provided support for stocks. In Powell’s potential appointment, investors see a continuation of the current monetary policy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 23,436.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.22 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,581.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 147.33 points, or 2.25 percent, to 6,704.10.

Earnings growth for the third quarter is now 6.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 273 companies that have posted earnings, 74 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 72 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Not all earnings were positive, however. Chevron’s (CVX.N) 4.53 percent fall weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil company’s profit missed estimates.

Merck (MRK.N) dropped 6.58 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs.

A United Nations report released on Thursday found Assad’s government to blame for a chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria which killed dozens of people in April and prompted a retaliatory U.S. missile strike.

Commenting on the release of that report, Johnson called on the international community to hold Assad’s government to account.

He also launched a fierce attack on Russia, which helped broker a deal in 2013 under which Assad agreed to destroy Syria’s chemical weapon stockpile.

“Russia has repeatedly attempted to disrupt efforts to get to the truth of the Khan Sheikhoun attack,” he said in a statement. “Russia has consistently chosen to cover up for Assad.”

“This behavior can only undermine the global consensus against the use of chemical weapons. I call on Russia to stop covering up for its abhorrent ally and keep its own commitment to ensure that chemical weapons are never used again.”

Russia has defended the Syrian leader against U.S. allegations that his forces carried out the attack, saying there was no evidence. Russia said the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad’s government.

The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the country’s more than six-year civil war. Moscow backs Syrian government forces against rebels in the war.

The chemical weapons investigation mechanism was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which includes Russia, in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate.

Russian ambassador to the U.N. Vassily Nebenzia said Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursday’s report was discussed.

Johnson’s comments come only weeks after his foreign ministry announced he would travel to Moscow later this year to discuss international security issues.

Johnson has previously described diplomatic relations with Russia as “difficult” but said the British government had a policy of engaging with Moscow “to further mutual interests where they exist”.

In April, following the sarin gas attack, he canceled what would have been the first visit to Russia in five years by a British foreign secretary.","Russia undermining action against chemical weapons, says UK, citing Syria 'cover up'",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CW1AN

The journalists - Lau Hon Meng from Singapore and Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia - were being questioned at a police station in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw after being detained in the morning, a local police officer told Reuters.

About 25 police staged an evening raid on the Yangon house of their Myanmar interpreter, well-known local reporter Aung Naing Soe, seizing his computer memory sticks and searching his documents.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled majority-Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown.

In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the death of the Rohingya in Myanmar constituted a “genocide” aimed at Muslim communities in the region.

Shwe Thaung, an officer from the Naypyitaw police station No.1, where the four were being detained, confirmed the basic facts of the incident but declined to elaborate, including on whether any charges had been filed, citing an ongoing investigation.

“We are still investigating and can’t say more than that,” Shwe Thaung said.

Myanmar state broadcaster MRTV said the journalists did not have permission to film the parliament with a drone. It showed their journalist visas and said the ministry of foreign affairs had informed the Singaporean and Malaysian embassies about the matter.

Turkish state broadcaster TRT could not immediately be reached for comment.

Several journalists in Myanmar have been arrested this year, leading rights groups to warn that the gains made in press freedom since the end of military rule risk being reversed under the rule of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Local journalist Aung Naing Soe has worked with many international media on the country’s transition to democracy after nearly five decades of military dictatorship.

An administrator from Yangon’s Mingalar Taung Nyunt district, Ye Win Tun, who took part in the raid, confirmed that the police did not have a warrant but also said they did not need one.

“The search warrant would be necessary if they were searching for drugs or illegal card games, but in this instance it’s OK if the local administrator is there,” said Ye Win Tun.

He said the search lasted two hours and was carried out by the district police chief, township police officer, immigration officer, police special branch and several police officers, a total of about 25 people.",Myanmar detains reporters on assignment for Turkish state TV,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CW2OL

The government’s Insolvency Service said 27,807 people in England and Wales registered as insolvent between July and September, up from 22,389 in the three months to June and marking the biggest total since the third quarter of 2012.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the figure was just short of a three-year high struck in the first quarter of 2017.

Personal insolvencies have been rising over the past couple of years, largely due to changes in regulation that have made debt relief for consumers easier to obtain, according to experts in the field.

But debt charities and the Institute of Chartered Accounts in England and Wales (ICAEW) warned that the latest sharp increase indicated wider problems in Britain’s consumer-led economy.

Household budgets have been strained by rising prices caused by the pound’s drop after last year’s Brexit vote, and wage growth has failed to keep pace.

The insolvency figures are likely to bolster the view of economists who worry that even a small rise in Bank of England interest rates could have an outsized impact on consumers.

A clear majority of economists in a Reuters poll published on Tuesday expect the BoE will raise interest rates next Thursday to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent - although most also said it would be a mistake to act now. [BOE/INT]

“With household debt levels continuing to rise, we are concerned that more families will be pushed into difficulty if circumstances change,” said Jane Tully, director of external affairs at the Money Advice Trust charity.

The figures showed the increase in personal insolvency was down to a rise in individual voluntary arrangements - a debt relief measure short of bankruptcy.

The ICAEW said the insolvency figures boded poorly for the wider economy.

“Consumer insolvencies are a reliable marker of business challenges ahead,” said Clive Lewis, head of enterprise at the ICAEW.

“We anticipate a worsening scene for businesses in the forthcoming quarter and would urge all owner-managers to look out for early signs of trouble and act fast to address them.”

Lewis said he thought even a small increase in interest rates could persuade consumers that they were not able to afford contracts that they had entered into, citing loans for car purchase as a particular area of concern.

The BoE has said there is no overall debt bubble in Britain but it has expressed concern about consumer debt, which had been growing at about 10 percent a year.

Earlier this month a BoE survey showed lenders are planning the biggest cutback in new consumer lending in nearly 10 years.",UK personal insolvencies hit five-year high in gloomy sign for economy,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-insolvency/uk-personal-insolvencies-hit-five-year-high-in-gloomy-sign-for-economy-idUKKBN1CW1W2

The Spanish football league’s president Javier Tebas was previously quoted as saying that, should Catalonia become independent, the region’s sides would not be able to compete in La Liga.

Valverde declined to comment on the possibility of that happening.

”Nothing has happened (in relation to Barcelona not being in La Liga) and we’re only talking about hypothetical situations,” he said.

“I have my own opinion but I just want to concentrate on sporting questions, especially because the political situation appears to change every half hour.”

In a bid to draw a line under Spain’s worst political crisis in 40 years, the government in Madrid on Friday sacked Catalonia’s regional government, dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for Dec. 21.

In what appears to be a doomed gesture, the parliament had hours earlier declared independence following a referendum on secession that Spanish courts had ruled was illegal.

On the pitch, table-topping Barca confirmed that midfield playmaker Andres Iniesta would miss Saturday’s visit to Athletic Bilbao.

The club captain, who this week was named in the FIFPro Team of the Year, has a thigh strain and adds to a growing list of absentees for Valverde that also includes Ousmane Dembele, Rafinha, Arda Turan, Aleix Vidal and Thomas Vermaelen.

The news is not all negative, however, with full back Jordi Alba given the green light by the club’s medical staff to return to action.

Valverde joined Barca from Bilbao in the summer and will visit his former club as coach of the Catalans for the first time, insisting he will not allow emotion to get the better of him.

The two sides have held discussions, and talks are continuing ahead of a mid-December deadline to prepare proxy resolutions for next spring’s shareholder meeting, activists said.

An Exxon spokesman said it was meeting with investors but declined to discuss specifics.

A number of investors said they were looking for Exxon to give details such as those recently recommended by a climate task force of the Financial Stability Board. It suggested companies lay out the impact they would face from policies like carbon pricing plans, or how changes in supply and demand for resources like oil would affect their balance sheets.

“We’re hopeful that Exxon will take the opportunity to get in front of this and set new standards in terms of disclosure and transparency around climate change,” said Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research for asset manager Schroders, one of the filers of the resolution which has since spoken with Exxon executives.

Spokespeople for the Church of England and for New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the lead sponsors of the May resolution, also confirmed they were in talks with Exxon.

“We have an active engagement process for environmental, social and governance matters,” said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri, who declined to comment on specific meetings with activists. Last year, the company interacted with shareholders that held 1.1 billion shares, including 40 percent of its institutional holders, he said.

In May, Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said the world’s largest publicly-traded energy company would consider the issue after 62 percent of shares voted at the meeting supported a non-binding call for an annual climate-impact review.

Exxon faces several lawsuits, including from New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general, over the possibility it misled the public and investors about the risks of climate change. Exxon has denied the allegations and called them politically motivated.

Calls for companies to disclose more about how they will fare in a warming world received higher-than-usual levels of support at shareholder meetings this past spring, sometimes with new backing from asset managers like BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group.

Occidental Petroleum Corp, (OXY.N) said in a second quarter earnings presentation that it would provide additional disclosure of “climate-related risks and opportunities” after a majority of investors backed a call for such a report in May.

Also, this month refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) published a report, “Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios,” meant partly to address suggestions from the Financial Stability Board.

A shareholder measure calling for a climate-impact report received 41 percent support at Marathon’s annual meeting in April.

Some investor activists have a “wait and see” position on what Exxon may disclose. “It’s very unclear what Exxon is going to do” at this point, said Danielle Fugere, president of shareholder advocate As You Sow. She said the California group withdrew a resolution ahead of Exxon’s 2014 shareholder meeting calling for a climate risk analysis, only to be disappointed by the resulting document. On the other hand, were Exxon to do nothing this time around, its directors could face calls for their removal, Fugere said.","Exxon, investors huddle on climate data as proxy deadline looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-climate-report/exxon-investors-huddle-on-climate-data-as-proxy-deadline-looms-idUSKBN1CW2LZ?il=0

“It doesn’t say if you smoke more marijuana, you’ll have more sex,” he said.","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Where there is smoke, there tends to be fire, say medical researchers who found frequent marijuana users have about 20 percent more sex than those who abstain.

Stanford University School of Medicine researchers unveiled the link between marijuana and the frequency of sexual intercourse in a study published on Friday in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Researchers in California reached their conclusions after a retrospective analysis of data on 50,000 Americans ages 25 to 45, compiled from 2002 to 2015 by the National Survey of Family Growth. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsors the survey.

Respondents were asked how many times they have had heterosexual intercourse in the past four weeks and how frequently they have smoked marijuana over the past 12 months, Stanford researchers said in a press release.

Women who were daily pot users had sex an average of 7.1 times during the previous four weeks, compared with 6.0 times reported by those who denied using marijuana in the past year. For men, daily users reported 6.9 times compared with 5.6 for non-users.

“In other words, pot users are having about 20 percent more sex than pot abstainers,” said the study’s senior author, Dr. Michael Eisenberg, assistant professor of urology at Stanford.

Given that the average couple has sex about once a week, Eisenberg said, the bottom line for partaking in a bong or blunt could add up to 20 more instances of sexual intercourse each year.

FILE PHOTO: A participant smokes a marijuana joint during the Global Marijuana March 2017, in support of the legalization of marijuana in Mexico City, Mexico, May 6, 2017. REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo

“I think if you asked a man or a woman, 20 more times to have sex over a year, that would seem like a lot,” Eisenberg said.

It used to be thought that couples mostly smoked after sex, but Eisenberg said his findings show the opposite is true for “all races, ages, education levels, income groups and religions, every health status, whether they were married or single and whether or not they had kids.”

Marijuana is legal for medical or recreational adult use in 29 states and the District of Columbia, said spokesman Morgan Fox of the Marijuana Policy Project.

FILE PHOTO: Women wearing marijuana leaf masks kiss at the 4/20 marijuana holiday in Civic Center Park in downtown Denver. U.S., April 20, 2013. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo

A record percentage of Americans - 64 percent - now believe adult use of the drug should be legal, according to a Gallup poll published this week.

Eisenberg cautioned the study should not be misinterpreted as having proven a causal link.

“It doesn’t say if you smoke more marijuana, you’ll have more sex,” he said.

Still, for many, research in the name of science may never be so fun.

Bournemouth beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge two years ago and Daniels believes taking points against top teams will be key to their chances of top-flight survival.

“If we can start getting more points against the big sides, that will be important for us and we will feel we are going in the right direction.”

Bournemouth claimed their first points on the road this season with a 2-1 win at Stoke last weekend and Daniels backs his team mates to deliver another spirited performance against Antonio Conte’s Chelsea.

”Hopefully, Stoke was the turning point,“ he added. ”We needed to pick up points and now we are a lot better off because if we had lost we could have been a few points adrift.

Brazil awarded six of the eight blocks on offer in the auction for the rights to pump oil from the country’s coveted pre-salt region, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped below thousands of feet of salt in the country’s Atlantic waters.

The wins will bolster Shell’s position as the largest foreign operator in Brazil’s offshore oil sector, second only to state-run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) (PETR4.SA).

The Anglo-Dutch oil major won one area in consortium with France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), another with Petrobras and Repsol-Sinopec, and a third with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) and China’s CNOOC.

Shell has said it is confident it can pump from the pre-salt fields at below $40 a barrel.

Rival BP Plc (BP.L), which is active in Brazil but not yet producing oil, took two more blocks on Friday.

“We see the government of Brazil being more supportive of foreign companies entering Brazil,” BP Latin America President Felipe Arbelaez said after the rounds.

“There are high quality assets. We believe that the assets here will be resilient in any price environment.”

Brazil earned 6.15 billion reais ($1.88 billion) in signing bonuses for the six fields that it awarded in the auction.

President Michel Temer’s government has enacted reforms to make the energy sector more attractive to foreign investment, and for the first time international oil firms will be allowed to operate fields in the pre-salt.

Countries worldwide sitting on oil and gas reserves are keen to pump it before it becomes less valuable as global policies to address climate change kick in.

The opposition in Brazil has opposed some of the reforms, and the auction was delayed by three hours on Friday after a federal judge issued an injunction to suspend the process at the behest of the leftist Workers Party.

That left top executives from the world’s largest oil companies milling around in the hotel that hosted the auction, in an upscale seaside neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.

EXXON

In a twist, U.S. major Exxon Mobil, whose 10-block win in last month’s Brazilian auction was seen by many as a prelude to a big play on Friday, took just one block as part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil ASA (STL.OL) and Portugal’s Petrogal [PETP.UL], a unit of Galp Energia (GALP.LS). Two blocks got no bids.

The quality of reserves and the reforms have made Brazil an important target for oil majors, even though they have had less appetite for capital-intensive mega projects since crude prices crashed in 2014.

Brazil has high hopes for the volume of oil the companies can pump from the blocks. Brazilian oil output could double to more than 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, compared with the 2.6 million bpd produced in August, regulator ANP said on Thursday.

Although the Catalan declaration appears to be a doomed gesture, both sides’ moves take Spain’s worst political crisis in four decades to a new and possibly dangerous level.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for calm and said the rule of law would be restored in Catalonia, where secessionists have long cherished the dream of a separate nation.

A crowd of more than 2,000 independence supporters gathered in the Ciutadella Park outside the regional parliament in Barcelona, shouting “Liberty” in Catalan and singing traditional songs as the independence vote went through.

The motion passed in the parliament after a passionate debate from advocates and opponents of independence said Catalonia constituted an independent, sovereign and social democratic state.

Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont left the chamber to shouts of “President!” and mayors who had come from outlying areas brandished their ceremonial batons and sang the Catalan anthem “Els Segadors” (The Reapers).

“Catalonia is and will be a land of freedom. In times of difficulty and in times of celebration. Now more than ever”, Puigdemont said on Twitter.

But immediately after news of the vote, which three opposition parties boycotted, Spanish shares and bonds were sold off, reflecting business concern over the turmoil in the wealthy region.

Within an hour, the upper house of Spain’s parliament in Madrid authorized Rajoy’s government to rule Catalonia directly -- an unprecedented move in Spain since the return of democracy in the late 1970s.

In Brussels, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the independence vote changed nothing and the EU would only deal with the central government.

The United States, Britain, France and Germany also swiftly dismissed the declaration and expressed support for Rajoy’s efforts to keep Spain united.

FIRING THE GOVERNMENT?

Rajoy’s cabinet was meeting on Friday evening to adopt the first measures to govern Catalonia. This could include firing the Barcelona government and assuming direct supervision of Catalan police forces.

“Exceptional measures should only be adopted when no other remedy is possible,” Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in an address to the Senate on Friday morning.

“In my opinion there is no alternative. The only thing that can be done and should be done is to accept and comply with the law,” said Rajoy, who has staked out an uncompromising position.

How direct rule would work on the ground - including the reaction of civil servants and the police - is uncertain. Some independence supporters have promised to mount a campaign of civil disobedience.

The main secessionist group, the Catalan National Assembly, called on civil servants not to follow orders from the Spanish government and urged them to follow “peaceful resistance”.

“Tensions are likely to rise significantly over the coming days,” Antonio Barroso of Teneo Intelligence said in a note.

“Demonstrators might try to prevent the police from removing Catalan ministers from their offices if the central government decides to do so. This increases the risk of violent clashes with the police.”

The crisis unfolded after Catalonia held an independence referendum on Oct. 1 which was declared illegal by Madrid. Although it endorsed independence, it drew only a 43 percent turnout as Catalans who oppose independence largely boycotted it.

The crisis has split Catalonia and caused deep resentment around Spain. National flags now hang from many balconies in the capital in an expression of unity.

Catalonia is one of Spain’s most prosperous regions and already has a high degree of autonomy. But it has a litany of historic grievances, exacerbated during the 1939-1975 Franco dictatorship, when its culture and politics were suppressed.

The chaos has also prompted a flight of business from region and alarmed European leaders who fear the crisis could fan separatist sentiment around the continent.

NOT EASY

“It is not going to be easy, it is not going to be free, it is not going to change in a day. But there is no alternative to a process towards the Catalan Republic,” lawmaker Marta Rovira of the Junts pel Si pro-independence alliance said in a debate leading to the vote.

After the debate, lawmakers from members of three main national parties -- the People’s Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos -- walked out. Members of the pro-independence parties and the far-left Podemos then voted 70-10 in favor in a secret ballot aimed at hindering any attempt by Madrid to lay criminal charges on them.

Spain’s constitutional court said it was reviewing the vote. The state prosecutor and other parties have three days to open a case.

Montserrat Rectoret, a 61-year-old historian, was among the crowds in Barcelona.

“I am emotional because Catalonia has struggled for 40 years to be independent and finally I can see it,” she said.","Catalonia declares independence from Spain, direct Madrid rule looms",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/catalonia-declares-independence-from-spain-direct-madrid-rule-looms-idUKKBN1CW0VB?il=0

Infantino also confirmed that FIFA will officially recognise as world club champions the winners of the old Intercontinental Cup dating back to 1960 - a contest that became notorious for some of the most unsavoury matches in the sport.

FIFA currently organises a Club World Cup every year, featuring the champion clubs of each continent, but it has recently suffered from European dominance with teams from other regions unable to mount a serious challenge.

The Confederations Cup is held in the year before a World Cup and features the respective national team champions of each continent.

“The current Club World Cup is a nice competition but it has not really had the impact that was hoped in development of club football around the world,” Infantino told a media conference following a FIFA Council meeting.

“We have to see if we can come up with something special, something new which will help club football and confederations all around the world.”

“When FIFA organises a competition, it should be something special, so either we find a special tournament or we’d rather not do it.”

But Infantino stressed that it was important not to further congest the international calendar.

“One option could be to organise it instead of the Confederations Cup,” he said.

The Club World Cup has been held in its current form since 2005. Before that, from 1980 to 2004, a single match was played between the champions of Europe and South America in Tokyo.

That in turn was preceded by the so-called Intercontinental Cup, which also featured European and South American champions and was played over two legs, with one match on each continent.

The fixture was marred by so much violence that, eventually, some teams refused to take part.

One of the most notorious fixtures was in 1967 when a brutal two-leg tie between Scotland’s Celtic and Argentina’s Racing Club went to a replay in Uruguay. Six players were sent off and became known as the ‘Battle of Montevideo’.

Among the teams to benefit from Friday’s decision were Italian club AC Milan, Uruguay’s Penarol and Real Madrid, who all won the Intercontinental three times in the 1960-2004 period.

A Pele-inspired Santos team, Portugal’s Porto and Brazil’s Sao Paulo were among the clubs to win it twice.

Dos Santos, 75, handpicked Lourenço, 63, to succeed him when he stepped down last month after 38 years in power, prompting critics to suggest the little-known newcomer would be a puppet of the dominant dos Santos family.

But analysts, diplomats and politicians have been surprised by the speed at which Lourenço has tried to take on some of the entrenched vested interests that control sub-Saharan Africa’s third largest economy and second biggest oil exporter.

Heavyweights from the previous administration, such as Vice President Manuel Vicente and Minister of State Manuel “Kopelipa” Hélder Vieira Dias Jr, have found themselves out of a job.

Dos Santos still retains significant power as the head of the ruling MPLA party, and key posts such as the finance minister and central bank governor have not yet been touched.

But in the vital oil sector, responsible for 75 percent of government revenue, Lourenço curbed the control of dos Santos’ daughter, Isabel, who runs national oil company Sonangol.

This month Lourenço appointed Carlos Saturnino, who was sacked by Isabel dos Santos last year, as Secretary of State for Oil, a technically more senior role than that of his old boss.

“It was unexpected at this early stage,” said Marcolino Moco, a former Angolan prime minister and critic of Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

“It’s very early still, but Lourenço is sending a sign that the excesses of the dos Santos era will not continue.”

Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s richest woman, denied any tension with Lourenço, telling Reuters last week that their views were in “full alignment”.

MONOPOLIES

In his state of the nation address on October 16, Lourenço vowed to break up monopolies in the economy, directly mentioning the cement industry in which Isabel and her husband have large holdings.

He also abolished government communications department GRECIMA, with which a company co-owned by another dos Santos daughter, Welwitschia, had lucrative contracts. The company, Semba Comunicação, could not be reached for comment.

“Breaking the monopolies enjoyed by the dos Santos family would be going for the jugular,” said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an author and expert on Angola who teaches at Oxford University.

“But there is a danger of confusing a vendetta against dos Santos with a true reform agenda,” Oliveira said.

Major reform is desperately needed. Although an oil boom has made Angola one of Africa’s richest countries per capita, it is also one of the world’s most unequal, with the vast majority of the population sharing little of its wealth.

Angola’s economy fell into recession last year and unemployment is at least 25 percent. A lack of foreign currency has forced companies, such as airlines and oil services, to pull back operations. A dollar fetches three times the official rate on the black market.

Ratings agency Moody’s downgraded Angola’s credit rating last week, saying the economy remained constrained by foreign currency shortages, high inflation, low public spending and a weak banking system.

There are early indications Lourenço may be placing capable technocrats into roles to fix some of these problems.

Ricardo Viegas de Abreu, a banking executive and former deputy governor of the central bank, was appointed last week Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs.

José Massano, a former central bank governor popular with international investors, could return to his old job, local media reported Wednesday. A spokesperson for the central bank declined to comment.

For Lourenço’s opponents the jury is still out.

The 49-year-old father of four was apprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers after dropping his 12-year-old daughter off at her Los Angeles school in February.

The arrest got national attention after another one of his daughters filmed him being taken away in a video that went viral.

Avelica-Gonzalez, who was released on bond in late August after spending six months in custody, continues to fight deportation while working as a cook in the city.

He said the success of “Los Dodgers” has given those living in the Los Angeles area illegally something to rally around at a time when the Trump administration’s efforts to step up deportations has created deep uncertainty and fear.

“The Dodgers being in the World Series is helping us forget some of our problems,” Avelica-Gonzalez told Reuters through an interpreter while wearing a crisp white Dodgers jersey.

“The whole Mexican community is united to support them.”

Avelica-Gonzalez and his wife were in downtown L.A. to attend an oversight commission meeting looking into what extent the Los Angeles Sheriff was cooperating with ICE.

The heated affair included immigration advocates, who argued ICE was breaking families apart, and Trump supporters, who called the immigrants criminals and held signs saying “Illegals Don’t Have Rights” and “Respect President Trump.”

The tension was enough to make anyone yearn for the distraction of a good ball game.

More illegal immigrants live in Southern California than anywhere else in the country, according to the Pew Research Center study. There are about 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, according to Pew.

While beloved now, the Dodgers history with the city’s Mexican-American community is complicated.

Los Angeles County forced Mexican-American families out of their homes in the Chavez Ravine the late 1950s after a decade-long standoff to make way for Dodgers Stadium.

Despite that history, the team is embraced by the community.

DODGERS UNITE ANGELENOS

“The Dodgers have always been something that brings the immigrant community together,” said Tessie Borden, an organizer of Indivisible Highland Park, a group that advocates for illegal immigrants.

“Their success is important now because it’s something joyful and something everyone can agree on,” she said.

“You can be on any side of the immigration issue and still be a Dodgers fan.”

A native of Nayarit, Mexico, Avelica-Gonzalez was drawn to the Dodgers because of Mexican pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, the Dodgers ace who spent 17 seasons in the big leagues and who became a naturalized American citizen after he retired.

Valenzuela made a surprise appearance before Game Two of the World Series on Wednesday in Los Angeles to throw out the first pitch.

“He is a very dear to all Mexicans,” Avelica-Gonzalez said.

Before even coming to Los Angeles, Avelica-Gonzalez was a fan of the team.

He listened to the Dodgers win their last World Series in 1988 on the radio in Mexico and dreamed of seeing the team play live.

He remains a loyal fan, proudly displaying photos of his children with notable Dodgers including Rich Hill and Austin Barnes from public appearances they made last year.

He said that as much as he wants to see the Dodgers win the title, he knows the battle taking place off the field has even higher stakes.

His remarks came before U.S. President Donald Trump - who has threatened to destroy the North if necessary - leaves on his first trip to Asia next week, including a stop in South Korea to meet President Moon Jae-in.

For his part, Moon, after talks with Mattis, said the “aggressive deployment” of U.S. strategic assets in the region, which have included overflights by U.S. bombers, had been effective in deterring the North Korean threat.

Tension between North Korea and the United States has been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, stoking fears any miscalculation could lead to an armed confrontation.

“North Korean provocations continue to threaten regional and global security despite unanimous condemnation by the United Nations Security Council,” Mattis said in prepared remarks as he visited the demilitarized zone (DMZ).

“As Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear, our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”

Standing alongside Mattis, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo said: “We together will continue to defend peace through strong will and strong might.”

TRUMP VISIT LOOMS

Ahead of Trump’s visit to Asia, Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to the region.

“That’s really what it was all about – to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution,” Mattis said earlier this week after three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.

At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang and bolster the South’s defenses.

Washington’s top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with his South Korean counterpart, General Kyeong Doo Jeong, a U.S. military statement said. Dunford renewed U.S. warnings of retaliation to further provocations.

“(Dunford) reaffirmed that any attack by North Korea would be met with a response that will be overwhelming and effective, using the full range of U.S. military capabilities,” the statement said.

The United States flew Air Force bombers over waters east of North Korea last month in a show of force. The U.S. Navy, in what it says was a long-planned maneuver, will have three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups in the Pacific in the coming days.

Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.

U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize.

The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for “flagrant” human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad.

In a speech last month at the United Nations, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as “mentally deranged.”

Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.

“Do we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,” Mattis told reporters traveling with him this week.

Pesquisadores da Escola de Medicina da Universidade Stanford desvendaram o laço entre a maconha e a frequência sexual em um estudo publicado nesta sexta-feira no periódico científico Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Cientistas da Califórnia chegaram a tais conclusões após uma análise retrospectiva de dados de 50 mil norte-americanos de 25 a 45 anos de idade compilados de 2002 a 2015 pela Pesquisa Nacional de Crescimento Familiar. Os Centros de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças do governo federal patrocinam o estudo.

Os entrevistados foram indagados quantas vezes tiveram relações heterossexuais nas quatro semanas anteriores e com que frequência fumaram maconha nos últimos 12 meses, explicaram os pesquisadores de Stanford em um comunicado à imprensa.

As mulheres que eram usuárias diárias da erva fizeram sexo em média 7,1 vezes nas quatro semanas anteriores, mais do que a média de 6 vezes daquelas que negaram ter usado maconha no ano anterior. Entre os homens, os usuários diários relataram 6,9 vezes, e os não-usuários 5,6.

“Em outras palavras, os usuários de maconha estão fazendo sexo cerca de 20 por cento a mais do que os abstêmios”, disse o principal autor do estudo, doutor Michael Eisenberg, professor-assistente de urologia de Stanford.

Dado que o casal típico faz sexo em média uma vez por semana, segundo Eisenberg, compartilhar um cachimbo ou cigarro pode proporcionar até 20 relações sexuais adicionais por ano.

“Acho que, se você perguntasse a um homem ou a uma mulher, fazer sexo 20 vezes mais ao longo de um ano pareceria muito”, disse Eisenberg.

Costumava-se pensar que os casais fumavam mais depois do sexo, mas Eisenberg disse que suas descobertas mostram que o oposto é verdadeiro para “todas as raças, níveis educacionais, grupos de renda e religiões, todas as condições de saúde, casados ou não e com filhos ou não”.

A maconha é legal para uso medicinal ou recreativo de adultos em 29 Estados norte-americanos e no Distrito de Columbia, disse Morgan Fox, porta-voz do Projeto de Políticas para a Maconha.

Hoje uma porcentagem recorde de norte-americanos – 64 por cento – acredita que o uso de drogas deveria ser legal para adultos, de acordo com uma pesquisa do instituto Gallup publicada nesta semana.

Mas Eisenberg alertou que o estudo não provou um elo causal: “Ele não diz que, se você fumar maconha, fará mais sexo”.",Sexo e drogas: estudo dos EUA liga uso de maconha a vida sexual mais ativa,https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idBRKBN1CW2PD-OBREN

The benchmark U.S. S&P500 index .SPX was up 0.8 percent late Friday, on track for it's biggest one day gain since Sept. 11 this year.

The Catalan parliament’s declaration of independence from Spain, made after a secret ballot, is now likely to be ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.41 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.56 percent to $1.1585.

Gains in the dollar were pared briefly after a Bloomberg report that said U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next U.S. central bank chairman. Powell is seen likely to maintain the Fed’s current monetary policy.

U.S. Treasury note yields remained lower, following the Catalan news and the Bloomberg report.

Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.4301 percent, from 2.454 percent late on Thursday.

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.9397 percent, from 2.961 percent late on Thursday.

Gold prices edged higher on Friday, after the Catalonian parliament’s independence declaration from Spain led investors to seek safety from political upheaval. Spot gold XAU= added 0.3 percent to $1,271.02 an ounce.

EARNINGS

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.44 percent.

On Wall Street, gains were led by robust corporate earnings and the third-quarter GDP growth, both of which lifted investor sentiment.

“While valuations are full, it certainly becomes imperative on them to deliver solid operating results and that’s something that we did see.”

Merkel, whose conservative alliance placed first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 election, is trying to form a government that unites conservatives, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on contentious issues and what one negotiator called “a big clash” during 11 hours of meetings on Thursday.

Manfred Weber, a senior member of the Bavarian conservative CSU who is involved in the talks, said the process would be “very difficult”, but his party still aimed to reach agreement by the end of the year.

“Our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-November where we can tell our (party) committees ‘yes, this works, let us begin concrete negotiations’,” Weber told broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. “And then I hope we will have a new government by the end of the year.”

Immigration was the most divisive topic on Thursday. Many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on Merkel’s decision to open Germany to more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016.

Negotiators will meet again next Monday and Thursday, when they want to work out a solution on refugee policy, sources close to the talks said.

An agreement reached between Merkel’s CDU and the CSU to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord, Andreas Scheuer, CSU general secretary, said after Thursday’s talks. The Greens oppose a refugee cap.

Deputy FDP leader Wolfgang Kubicki said he was “depressed” by how the talks were being conducted, adding that all parties should be ready to compromise.

He told the RND newspaper chain that no coalition agreement could be reached if the Greens insisted that carbon dioxide emissions had to be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 from their level in 1990.

“The Greens are the smallest potential coalition partner. I they insist on all their demands, we’ll have to look each other in the eye and say, ‘Bon voyage’,” he told the paper.

The Greens’ top candidate, Katrin Goering-Eckhart, said on Friday her party could not continue negotiations unless all the parties agreed to climate pledges Germany had already accepted.

But Greens leader Cem Ozdemir warned against overinterpreting the tensions that surfaced on Thursday.

“So we had one big clash, but that’s part of what happens with these issues,” Ozdemir told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.

The border with Northern Ireland, which will be the UK’s only land frontier with the EU after its departure, is one of three issues Brussels wants broadly solved before talks on trade can start in December at the earliest.

“On the border issue, I‘m sorry but we need more clarity than we have right now. We cannot move ahead to phase two on the back of a promise that we don’t see any delivery mechanism to make a reality,” Coveney told a conference.

“We don’t need all the answers but we certainly need to have more assurance than we have today and we need some understanding that if the trade negotiations collapse, which could happen, that the Irish issues will still be resolved and prioritized.”

With close trading links to Britain, Ireland is considered the EU member most at risk when its neighbor leaves the bloc. That means it needs to plan “for all eventualities” and is already doing so, Coveney said.

Ireland has called for Britain and the EU to reach a bespoke customs union partnership to eliminate the risk of a “hard” border returning between it and Northern Ireland, which until a 1998 peace deal was separated by military checkpoints because of 30 years of sectarian violence in the province.

However, Dublin wants Britain to commit to a fallback option, including potential special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid a customs border should Britain’s plan of maintaining the closest possible ties with the EU fall through.

If those assurances are forthcoming, Dublin will “probably be Britain’s closest friend” in the trade talks but if London maintains its current position, some sort of customs border on the island of Ireland cannot be avoided, Coveney said.

Ireland’s Central Bank has told Irish firms to do more to prepare for an abrupt British departure and speaking at the same conference, Allied Irish Banks’ chairman said Ireland must be ready for a “car crash Brexit.”

“We must plan for the worst possible car-crash Brexit if the ultra-Brexiteers, the head-bangers, are prepared to blow up the British economy in the name of taking back control,” Richard Pym said.",Ireland says Brexit talks can't move on without clarity over border,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland/ireland-says-brexit-talks-cant-move-on-without-clarity-over-border-idUKKBN1CW0UM

If all goes as scripted, the bank will hike borrowing costs in the coming week for the first time in more than 10 years. But is the country really ready?

The consensus is for rise to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent.

That 0.25 percent was where the BoE put Bank Rate just over a year ago, shortly after British voters elected to leave the European Union. And there’s the rub: the uncertainty the vote triggered is still there.

A Reuters poll published in the past week showed more than 70 percent of economists believe now is not the time to raise rates -- though slightly more than that said it would happen anyway. [BOE/INT]

BoE Governor Mark Carney has made it clear a hike is in the offing, if not specifically saying at this coming meeting.

His concern is that low unemployment means Britain’s economy has little spare capacity and, accordingly, faces upward inflation pressure. Added to that are moves by other major central banks to rein in loose monetary policy, which could also push inflation higher by weakening the pound further.

The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since late 2015 and is expected to do so again. The European Central Bank is cutting back on its bond buying, albeit gently.

So the BoE needs to concern itself with a pressured pound and high employment driving up inflation that, at 3 percent, is already well above target and the highest in the Group of Seven industrialized nations.

But ranged against that is huge political and economic uncertainty over how Britain’s withdrawal from the EU will play out.

Companies are unclear about what to plan for, ranging from little short-term change to a complete revolution in how they do business.

Consumers too are wary as, while Britain’s economy has by no means not gone over a cliff, it has had some wobbles.

Retail sales, for example, contracted on a monthly basis in September and were up 1.2 percent year-on-year versus 4.1 percent a year earlier.

Preliminary third-quarter growth figures in the past week, meanwhile, were slightly better than expected. But at 1.5 percent year-on-year they are well below pre-Brexit vote levels and significantly lag both the United States and the euro zone.

This had prompted some economists to suggest Carney and the BoE are about to “do a Trichet” -- mirroring then-ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet’s raising of rates in 2008 just as the financial crisis was hitting.

Former BoE policymaker Danny Blanchflower - who voted against the BoE’s last hike in 2007, and has been regularly critical of suggestions to tighten policy since - has been scathing about the idea of a UK hike now.

“Nothing in data whatsoever says there should be a rate rise,” he tweeted.

(NOT) RISING SUN

The BoE is not the only central bank discussing policy. The Bank of Japan will announce its decisions on Tuesday.

Deflation -- Japan’s biggest economic problem for much of the past 20 years -- is over, but inflation is far from entrenched, limping along at just 0.7 percent year-on-year.

The economy too is somewhat off the pace, with the International Monetary Fund predicting 1.5 percent growth this year, though that is an improvement from 2016.

The biggest issue among economists with regard to the BoJ is whether it should reveal its plans to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy.

“We are anticipating few major changes in monetary policy,” Katsunori Kitakura, lead strategist at SuMi TRUST, wrote in a note. “The medium-term outlook for the Japanese economy is largely unchanged since the last policy meeting so the BoJ is likely to maintain the status quo.”

Underlining this, Reuters polls suggest the BoJ won’t start rolling back its monetary stimulus until late next year at the earliest -- the sort of unclouded policy outlook that the BoE’s Carney might arguably have cause to envy before the week is out.",Place your bets for the Brexit rate hike,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-economy-outlook/place-your-bets-for-the-brexit-rate-hike-idUKKBN1CW1R9

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA. Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there.

Teodorin Obiang, 48 ans, vice-président de Guinée équatoriale jugé en son absence pour blanchiment d‘abus de biens sociaux, abus de confiance, corruption et détournement de fonds publics, a été condamné à trois ans de prison avec sursis.

Le tribunal lui a aussi infligé une amende de 30 millions d‘euros avec sursis et a ordonné la confiscation de ses biens saisis en France, soit plus de 100 millions d‘euros, dont un vaste ensemble immobilier luxueux avenue Foch, à Paris.

Ce verdict pourrait faire jurisprudence pour les autres procès qui s‘annoncent dans le cadre des dossiers des “biens mal acquis”, notamment pour les familles d‘Ali Bongo (Gabon) et de Denis Sassou Nguesso (Congo-Brazzaville).

La justice française évalue les sommes “blanchies” en France entre 1997 et 2011 par Teodorin Obiang, à plus de 150 millions d‘euros, produit présumé de la corruption, de détournements de fonds publics et d‘autres délits commis en Guinée équatoriale.

Le ministère public avait requis le 7 juillet des peines de prison et d‘amende fermes. La présidente du tribunal a justifié le sursis par le fait que Teodorin Obiang a pu longtemps penser bénéficier d‘une forme d‘impunité en France.

Bénédicte de Perthuis a notamment dit tenir compte de la “complaisance” de la Société générale, “qui a permis à tout le moins par son absence de réaction la poursuite de l‘infraction”.

“L‘attitude de la Société générale, comme celle de la Banque de France, pendant de nombreuses années, a pu laisser penser (à Teodorin Obiang) qu‘il existait en France une forme de tolérance à l‘égard de ces pratiques”, a-t-elle expliqué.

“RÔLE DÉTERMINANT” DE LA BANQUE DE FRANCE

Elle a rappelé que la Société générale de banque de Guinée équatoriale (SGBGE), filiale à 42% de la Société générale, avait joué un “rôle essentiel” dans le transfert de fonds à l‘étranger au profit de Teodorin Obiang.

Bénédicte de Perthuis a cité une note interne de 2005 du responsable de la lutte anti-blanchiment de la Société générale, selon qui la SGBGE était en fait une “banque de l‘Etat Obiang”, et qui se plaint de l‘absence de contrôle ou d‘audit.

Elle a cité d‘autres notes internes démontrant que la direction de la Société générale était parfaitement au courant du rôle de sa filiale dans le détournement de fonds publics par Teodorin Obiang, sans que les conséquences en aient été tirées.

Selon Bénédicte de Perthuis, la Banque de France a aussi vu transiter de tels fonds “sans qu‘aucune alerte ne soit déclenchée” et a ainsi joué entre 2005 et 2011 un “rôle déterminant” dans les acquisitions de Teodorin Obiang.

Le tribunal a estimé pour toutes ces raisons que la peine principale devait être “essentiellement un avertissement destiné tant à la personne condamnée” qu‘aux autres protagonistes susceptibles d‘être impliqués dans le blanchiment.

“Malgré la gravité des faits, une peine d‘emprisonnement ferme n‘apparaît dans ce contexte ni nécessaire ni adaptée”, a dit la présidente. “Il ne paraît pas non plus justifié (...) qu‘une amende ferme destinée à être recouvrée par le Trésor public français soit prononcée.”

Les parties civiles ont salué un verdict “historique”.

“Maintenant on sait qu‘un chef d‘Etat ou un fils de chef d‘Etat peut être condamné”, a déclaré à Reuters Jean-Pierre Spitzer, avocat d‘un collectif d‘opposants équato-guinéens.

“En plus il y a deux grands signaux : l‘Etat français ne peut plus être un sanctuaire et le système bancaire est appelé à faire très très attention dans le futur”, a-t-il ajouté.

William Bourdon, avocat de l‘ONG Transparency international France (TIF), a fait valoir que les sursis ne devaient pas être compris comme une “faiblesse” ou une marque de “générosité” de la part du tribunal, dont il a au contraire salué le “courage”.

“Il a dit que ces infractions de blanchiment n‘ont pu prospérer qu‘en raison d‘une triple tolérance de la Société générale, de la Banque de France, des autorités françaises.”

D‘AUTRES PROCÈS À VENIR

Les avocats de Teodorin Obiang ont en revanche dénoncé un jugement “militant” et annoncé qu‘ils allaient examiner toutes les voies de recours possible.

“La décision rendue va à l‘encontre des engagements internationaux de la France”, a ainsi déclaré Emmanuel Marsigny, pour qui le tribunal “est allé au-delà de son rôle” en reprenant “sans aucun discernement” l‘argumentation des parties civiles.

Son collègue équato-guinéen Sergio Abeso Tomo a pour sa part dénoncé un “non-sens extraordinaire” : “On n‘a pas de peine de prison, pas d‘amende pour notre client mais on confisque un immeuble qui appartient à l‘Etat et qui abrite une ambassade.”

Si la condamnation est confirmée, il restera à mener la bataille de la restitution des sommes détournées à la population équato-guinéenne, ce qui suppose notamment une évolution de la législation française, a estimé le tribunal.

“Il apparaît désormais moralement injustifié pour l‘Etat prononçant la confiscation de bénéficier de celle-ci sans égard aux conséquences de l‘infraction”, a dit Bénédicte de Perthuis.

Au-delà du cas équato-guinéen, l‘enquête sur les “biens mal acquis” vise notamment les dirigeants gabonais et congolais.

Some lawmakers from states where state and local taxes are high and people benefit most from the federal income tax deduction are reluctant to contemplate such an elimination. It would be one of several measures aimed at offsetting lost revenue under sweeping tax cuts planned by President Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.

“We’re working with these lawmakers. We are making progress, but we aren’t there yet,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel. “I‘m hopeful at the end of the day we can find a good solution for them.”

A budget blueprint central to Republican efforts to enact the tax cut package - because it will enable easier passage of the package through the Senate - barely squeaked through the House on Thursday, with Democrats solidly opposed and a number of Republicans voting no in an effort to protect the deduction.

Brady also said lawmakers were exchanging ideas with Trump over how to handle 401(k) retirement savings plans.

In another measure to offset lost revenue, House Republicans have considered eliminating or capping the ability to contribute to the plans on a pre-tax basis, but Trump has said he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program.

“We want to increase the amount that you can give to your 401(k) or IRA (individual retirement account), for 401(k)s up to $20,000 or more,” Brady told Fox, without specifying whether that would be on a pre-tax or after-tax basis.

“We’re actually exchanging ideas with the president on how we help people save more and save sooner in their lives.”

The current cap on pre-tax 401(k) contributions is $18,000 a year, and that is set to rise to $18,500 next year.",Key U.S. House lawmaker sees progress allaying tax deduction concerns: Fox,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-deduction/key-u-s-house-lawmaker-sees-progress-allaying-tax-deduction-concerns-fox-idUSKBN1CW2CI

By Paresh Dave and Arjun Panchadar

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected advertising sales and higher operating margins, boosting its shares as investors brushed off concerns about higher costs for acquiring mobile users.

The stock was up nearly 3 percent at $1,001.50 after the bell. They have gained 25 percent this year.

Third-quarter revenue for Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped 24 percent to $27.8 billion, above the average analysts’ estimate of $27.2 billion. Profit of $6.7 billion, or $9.57 per share, was well ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Alphabet, along with much of the tech sector, has enjoyed torrid growth in recent years as advertising moves from traditional media to the internet and consumers flock to an ever-expanding array of digital devices.

While Google faces political pressure, especially in Europe, over its growing dominance and its role in spreading propaganda online, those problems have yet to hit the bottom line.

Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that efforts to attract “both large and small advertisers” around the world were paying off, especially in Asia, where sales rose 29 percent to $4.2 billion.

The third quarter was the 15th in a row in which Alphabet has shown double-digit, year-over-year consolidated sales increases. The pace is not slowing down, with the growth rate reaching its highest level in nearly five years.

Ad sales at Google, Alphabet’s main operating unit, account for the vast majority of the company’s revenue. The ad business faces competition from Facebook Inc but has continued to grow as more users turn to Google’s YouTube and mobile search services.

Alphabet shares trade for almost 25.8 times expected earnings and Facebook at about 26.5 times, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Investors have been increasingly concerned about a sharp rise in costs for getting ads in front of users as Google pays Apple Inc and other companies to integrate Google search into mobile products and services.

The payments are included in traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and they rose 54 percent in the quarter, accounting for 12 percent of ad sales.

Pichai defended the partnerships in response to several analysts’ questions on Thursday, calling the deals “a win-win construct” because Google performs “better when our partners do well.”

“We’re pretty comfortable with how we’re approaching it,” he said.

Other analysts said revenue growth and cost controls made TAC increases less of an issue.

“There is way too much focus on TAC as a cost - it’s a great investment for Google to control the publishing ecosystem,” said Richard Kramer of Arete Research.

James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, said: “TAC is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one.”

The third-quarter profit margin of 24 percent marked Alphabet’s highest since 27 percent in first quarter of 2013.

Google’s other revenue, which includes hardware such as the Pixel smartphones and Home speakers as well as the cloud computing business, also enjoyed solid growth. Sales from non-ad businesses rose 40 percent from a year ago to $3.4 billion in the quarter.

Among Google’s top priorities is expanding its salesforce to catch up with Amazon Web Services in providing corporate computing via large data centers, Pichai said. Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue, but Jefferies analysts estimate it at about 15 percent of Google’s other revenue.

Google also is trying to take on Apple in the high-end smartphone business with the Pixel. The company deepened its investment in September, agreeing to acquire 2,000 engineers from smartphone maker HTC Corp for $1.1 billion. Google’s Android operating system already powers most non-Apple smartphones.

But Google’s second-generation Pixel had a rough debut last week, with users complaining of a faulty screen and clicking noises during calls. The company responded on Thursday by doubling the warranty period for the smartphones to two years and promising to issue software fixes.

Losses from Alphabet’s Other Bets segment, which includes the Google Fiber broadband service and smart thermostat maker Nest, narrowed to $812 million from $861 million. The change reflected both an increase in sales across the companies and scaled back expansion plans for Fiber.

Google faces political uncertainty as European regulators crack down on its business practices and U.S. critics call for greater regulation of the tech industry.

The company recorded in the second quarter a $2.7 billion European Commission fine for unfair treatment of shopping websites in search results. Antitrust experts have said another fine could come by the end of year, as the EC investigates its distribution deals with smartphone vendors and wireless carriers.

Apparently alluding to political concerns about extremist propaganda and misinformation appearing on Google services, Pichai told analysts on Thursday that the company cared “deeply about the quality of information” it provides and would “constantly work to get this right.”",Alphabet's mobile ad revenue surges; shares jump,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-results/alphabets-mobile-ad-revenue-surges-shares-jump-idUKKBN1CV3AR?il=0

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites’.”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening up” policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography”.

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: Xi’s new power won’t stop dissent in China,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-xis-new-power-wont-stop-dissent-in-china-idUSKBN1CW2JW

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

“Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. “But it’s a little bit of a transition, especially as they’re trying to increase shale (output).”

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation.

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter’s exploration profit. Exxon’s total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil and Portugal’s Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.

Chevron’s stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian’s largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is “very important” in the company’s portfolio.

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron’s overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

They plan to introduce four-year-old Meng Meng to Jiao Qing, a panda three years her senior, in the hope that romance will help her with the frustrations associated with life in captivity that could be behind her habit.

“Meng Meng is in puberty,” Berlin Zoo director Andreas Knieriem told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper on Sunday. “The reverse walk is a protest against things she dislikes, be it the food or the carers.”

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier.
Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow.
Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.
“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.","(Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Thursday it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses over the past year and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue.

Shares of Twitter soared more than 18 percent to $20.31 in afternoon trading. The company also said user growth resumed in the third quarter after stalling in the prior three months.

Twitter has never had a profitable quarter based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but said it “will likely be GAAP profitable” in the fourth quarter if it hits the high end of its estimates.

The social media company has struggled to convert its appeal among celebrities and public figures such as U.S. President Donald Trump to attract users and advertisers amid fierce competition from Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Snap Inc’s (SNAP.N) Snapchat. It has worked in recent months to sign live-streaming deals and make other changes to improve user experience.

Revenue from data licensing and other sources in the third quarter was $87 million, Twitter said, up 22 percent from a year earlier. That helped cushion an 8 percent decrease in advertising revenue.

Twitter said it signed a “significant number” of enterprise deals in the third quarter, which would help stabilize its revenue flow. It did not name the companies it had inked deals with.

Twitter reported quarterly revenue of $590 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier, attributing much of the decrease to a previously announced decision to wind down its TellApart advertising product.

Analysts on average had expected revenue of $587 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

San Francisco-based Twitter also disclosed that it had discovered an error in how it had measured its user base since 2014 and revised its estimates downward, but said the difference amounted to less than 1 percent.

The company reported 330 million monthly active users in the quarter ended on Sept. 30, up 4 million from a quarter earlier, helped by email and push notifications.

In the United States, where growth had stalled earlier this year, the number of users rose to 69 million from 68 million.

Analysts on average expected 330.4 million monthly active users worldwide and 69 million in the United States, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.

Twitter said that in past estimates it had wrongly counted people who logged into applications associated with the company’s Fabric software platform, which Twitter sold this year to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.

Unlike Facebook, Twitter does not disclose daily active users, but says that number is less than half the monthly figure.

The decline in quarterly revenue was the third since Twitter’s debut as a public company in 2013 and raised concerns about growth among some analysts.

“Yes, they grew 4 million MAU sequentially, which is good enough for the stock to stay at current levels, but revenue growth remains a problem,” said Michael Pachter, managing director, equity research at Wedbush Securities.

“It’s great that they are controlling expenses and generating EBITDA growth, but investors want to see faster MAU growth and some revenue growth,” Pachter said.

Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on a conference call that the company was trying out ways to attract and engage more users.

“We’re playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics they care about. This is an area of experimentation,” he said.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said it banned advertisements from accounts owned by Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, citing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the outlets tried to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

The company has been under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers as part of a broad investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.

COST CUTS, SMALLER LOSS

Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $21 million, or 3 cents per share, from $103 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 10 cents per share.

Analysts expected a profit of 6 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Twitter cut expenses by 16 percent from a year earlier. Stock-based compensation declined 36 percent, but Twitter said the cuts were broad-based, covering sales and marketing and research and development.

Expenses would selectively increase moving forward, the company said.

Chief Operating Officer Anthony Noto told analysts that Twitter was still in the early stages of exploring a product around its TweetDeck interface.

“We’ve only done concept tests,” he said.

The company has stepped up efforts to keep people hooked through live-streaming deals, including for concerts, professional golf and news programs.

Twitter last month began testing tweets as long as 280 characters, double the existing cap, and has announced plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment.

Less than a year ago, none of this appeared possible for a nation that had largely been shunned by international teams since 2009 due to security risks.

That year gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team from their hotel to Lahore’s Gaddafi stadium for a test match, injuring six players and killing six security personnel and two civilians.

The incident forced Pakistan to play their home matches in the United Arab Emirates and the country has since remained starved of international cricket at home, apart from Zimbabwe’s limited-overs tour in 2015.

Last year, the inaugural Pakistan Super League (PSL), based on the franchise model of the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League, became a success though all the matches were played in the UAE.

Things changed in March this year when Pakistan hosted the final of its domestic T20 competition featuring high-profile international players.

“Even that baby step seemed an impossibility. I can tell you that none of the franchises wanted it, they were scared ... the government was scared...the players were scared,” Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters in an interview.

The match proved pivotal in changing the global cricket community’s opinion of Pakistan’s ability to host international matches and garnered support from cricket’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC).

The months leading up to the final were filled with endless negotiations with the government, persuading domestic franchise owners and convincing players that security was under control.

“I had two meetings with the prime minister, I raised it with him, he heard me out, he didn’t give me an opinion, he said we will think about it closer to the event,” Sethi said.

As the match drew closer Sethi became desperate, sending then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif numerous requests “from various quarters” in the hope that he would make a favourable announcement.

Sharif’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Weeks before the final was to be played Sharif made the announcement that it could go ahead.

“I think he saw the wisdom of it and took the risk,” said Sethi

ALMOST WENT UP IN SMOKE

In mid-February, less than a month before the final, a suicide attack outside Lahore’s provincial assembly killed 13 and wounded 83.

“There was doom and gloom over here. The franchises came to me and said nothing doing,” Sethi recalled.

A series of late night phone calls and endless meetings with players and franchise owners ensued. The PCB insisted that adequate security measures were in place.

Despite assurances, two days before the match, four international players pulled out, leaving the board 48 hours to find replacements.

“Luckily we had every contingency arrangement in place,” Sethi said.

After the final, Sethi went to work on bringing an international World XI to Pakistan with the support of the ICC.

An international security company hired by cricket’s world governing body gave Pakistan the green light.

Then came the work of assembling a high-profile team for the three-match series.

“I said unless and until you give me top quality players, no way,” Sethi said.

Once the players were finalised, administrators and fans were thrilled to welcome a star-studded World XI team led by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis.

“There was huge tension,” Sethi said, adding that despite all the planning, the PCB was still on edge during the series.

“There were all these calculated risks but in the end it worked out,” he added

Next on the list was Sri Lanka, whose players were reluctant to tour Pakistan after the events of 2009.

On a trip to Colombo, Sethi talked about how Pakistan had always toured Sri Lanka even during the civil war, which ended in 2009, when other countries refused to visit.

“I told them we need you now, when you needed us we were there for you,” he said.

With Sri Lanka’s visit confirmed, Sethi is confident that international cricket in Pakistan will soon be fully restored.

West Indies have committed to playing a three-match series but the dates are still undecided.

“I have two other countries lined up who are ready to come,” Sethi said. “By the end of 2020 I think every cricket country would have come and played in Pakistan.”",Cricket: Pakistan welcomes end of isolation from internationals,https://www.reuters.com/article/cricket-pakistan/cricket-pakistan-welcomes-end-of-isolation-from-internationals-idINKBN1CW2JA

After reporting their results, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Intel added nearly $140 billion to their already massive combined market value on Friday, pushing the broader, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC higher.

The companies together generated more than $100 billion in revenue in the September quarter, roughly 2 percent of United States’ national output.

Wall Street analysts scrambled to raise their price targets, with the most bullish pegging the companies’ stocks to rise between 21 percent and 47 percent in the next 12 months.

Google is “looking 20 years young,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who bumped up his price target on the stock by 9 percent to $1,150.

Amazon’s (AMZN.O) shares rose as much as 9 percent to a three-month high of $1,063.77. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Alphabet and Intel hit their highest in a decade.

“I expect markets to close the week on new record highs and a good portion of that should be attributed to the results that came from the tech companies,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

Amazon, which is winning business from older, big-box rivals, pleased investors with its transparency around Whole Foods, the premium grocer it recently bought.

“The Street went into third quarter earnings concerned about lack of disclosure around Whole Foods, and Amazon surprised to the upside here by breaking out Whole Foods contribution,” analysts at JP Morgan said.

Amazon’s shares, have risen 30 percent this year through Thursday’s close, as its AWS cloud business has stayed ahead of the competition.

Alphabet’s Google, a relatively smaller player in the cloud business, doesn’t break out revenue for Google Cloud Platform, but analysts estimate the business is growing very fast, complementing the company’s core advertising business.

The company’s stock is also relatively cheap, trading at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings, despite its 30 percent run this year, excluding gains on Friday.

Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) revenue rose the most in percentage terms in three years, underscoring the success of Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s turnaround strategy.

“I asked them to show me the search warrant.","NAYPYITAW/YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar police detained two journalists working for Turkey’s state broadcaster TRT and their interpreter and driver on Friday for flying a drone near the parliament compound, amid tension between the two countries over the Rohingya crisis.

The journalists - Lau Hon Meng from Singapore and Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia - were being questioned at a police station in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw after being detained in the morning, a local police officer told Reuters.

About 25 police staged an evening raid on the Yangon house of their Myanmar interpreter, well-known local reporter Aung Naing Soe, seizing his computer memory sticks and searching his documents.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled majority-Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown.

In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the death of the Rohingya in Myanmar constituted a “genocide” aimed at Muslim communities in the region.

Shwe Thaung, an officer from the Naypyitaw police station No.1, where the four were being detained, confirmed the basic facts of the incident but declined to elaborate, including on whether any charges had been filed, citing an ongoing investigation.

“We are still investigating and can’t say more than that,” Shwe Thaung said.

Myanmar state broadcaster MRTV said the journalists did not have permission to film the parliament with a drone. It showed their journalist visas and said the ministry of foreign affairs had informed the Singaporean and Malaysian embassies about the matter.

Turkish state broadcaster TRT could not immediately be reached for comment.

Several journalists in Myanmar have been arrested this year, leading rights groups to warn that the gains made in press freedom since the end of military rule risk being reversed under the rule of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Local journalist Aung Naing Soe has worked with many international media on the country’s transition to democracy after nearly five decades of military dictatorship.

His mother Thandar told Reuters police searched the house for computers and papers and asked for identification documents, and took Aung Naing Soe’s memory sticks. The police also tried but failed to open his computer, she said.

“I asked them to show me the search warrant. But the police said they didn’t need to do that because they were not searching for drugs,” Thandar said.

An administrator from Yangon’s Mingalar Taung Nyunt district, Ye Win Tun, who took part in the raid, confirmed that the police did not have a warrant but also said they did not need one.

“The search warrant would be necessary if they were searching for drugs or illegal card games, but in this instance it’s OK if the local administrator is there,” said Ye Win Tun.

He said the search lasted two hours and was carried out by the district police chief, township police officer, immigration officer, police special branch and several police officers, a total of about 25 people.",Myanmar detains reporters on assignment for Turkish state TV,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/myanmar-detains-reporters-on-assignment-for-turkish-state-tv-idUSKBN1CW2OR?il=0

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

“Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. “But it’s a little bit of a transition, especially as they’re trying to increase shale (output).”

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production.

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation.

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter’s exploration profit. Exxon’s total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway’s Statoil and Portugal’s Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia, won one of four blocks in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction.

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.

Chevron’s stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian’s largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is “very important” in the company’s portfolio.

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron’s overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

The loss in U.S. oil production narrowed sharply as the price received for its crude rose 13.5 percent over a year earlier.","Exxon, Chevron results linked to oil price, not cost cuts",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-results/exxon-chevron-results-linked-to-oil-price-not-cost-cuts-idUSKBN1CW1XT?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Maruti Suzuki’s chairman said there was still no clear roadmap on how the government aimed to achieve its target and a lot would depend on that.

“We will make electric cars but I can’t give you the date just now because it is all very much a work in progress,” R.C. Bhargava told reporters, after the company posted a 3 percent rise in quarterly profit, beating analysts’ estimates.

India is working on a new auto policy that promotes the use of electric cars, and a draft is likely to be made public before the end of the year. This is a shift from an earlier policy that promoted hybrid and electric vehicles.

Sales of electric cars in India remain negligible, however, mainly due to the high cost of batteries which make the vehicles expensive and out of reach for many buyers in a country where cars are as cheap as 250,000 rupees ($3,800). A lack of charging stations also makes the whole proposition unviable for now.

Maruti’s parent, Suzuki Motor Corp, has electric car technology which it can provide, Bhargava said, adding the Japanese company was also in talks with Toyota Motor Corp to form an alliance which may include sharing technologies like hybrid and electric.

Maruti dominates the small car market in India and has been launching more premium vehicles as competition heats up with newer and planned entrants such as Kia Motors and SAIC Motor Corp.

Maruti also manufactures hybrid cars, demand for which has taken a beating after the government raised sales taxes on them to as much as 43 percent. Bhargava said the future of hybrid cars in India would depend on the level of taxes and the company was in talks with the government to lower them.

GROWTH SLOWING

Bhargava said that while the company continued to expect double digit sales growth over the remainder of fiscal 2018, it would slow from the 18 percent posted in the second quarter.

Earlier on Friday, Maruti reported a profit of 24.84 billion rupees ($381.86 million) for the second quarter ended Sept. 30, versus 24.02 billion rupees a year ago, helped by higher sales of compact and utility vehicles. (bit.ly/2xtLHZZ)

Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 22.29 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Maruti, which provides the bulk of Suzuki Motor’s revenues, sold a total of 492,118 vehicles during the quarter, up about 18 percent from a year ago.

Sales of compact vehicles, which include the Swift and Baleno, rose 43.5 percent, while sales of utility vehicles like the Ertiga and Vitara Brezza climbed 27.6 percent.

Maruti shares closed slightly higher at 8,114.45 rupees.

Apesar de o bônus ter ficado abaixo do previsto (7,7 bilhões de reais), uma vez que o governo tinha a expectativa de que todos os blocos seriam arrematados, o governo levou elevados percentuais de óleo nas rodadas, que foram sob partilha de produção, com forte competição nas áreas de Peroba e Norte de Carcará.

Nas licitações de partilha, as empresas vencedoras são as que oferecem ao Estado brasileiro, a partir de um percentual mínimo fixado, o maior percentual de excedente em óleo. O bônus é fixo.

Apenas consórcios liderados por empresas que já são operadoras no pré-sal brasileiro (Petrobras, Shell e Statoil) venceram o leilão, ante expectativa do governo de ver uma diversificação das lideranças na importante província petrolífera.

“Nossa participação foi super ativa, estou extremamente feliz e seremos operadores em dois blocos, o que é extremamente importante para nós”, disse o CEO da Shell no Brasil, André Araújo, a jornalistas.

Apesar de a operação das novas áreas seguir nas mãos das companhias que já atuam no Brasil, o leilão mostrou a entrada de novas empresas no polígono do pré-sal, como a norte-americana Exxon.

Les Pixel 2 et 2XL, lancés jeudi au prix de départ de 649 dollars, sont à la pointe de l‘offensive lancée par Google pour concurrencer l‘iPhone d‘Apple.

Google a dit dimanche qu‘il voulait déterminer si les écrans du Pixel 2 étaient affectés par un problème de rétention de l‘image, à la suite des informations publiées par le blog AndroidCentral après une semaine d‘utilisation du combiné.

Cette rétention (dite “burn-in”) n‘apparaît habituellement qu‘après plusieurs années d‘usage.

Google devra sans doute arrêter la production s‘il y a un problème, a dit Ryan Reith, analyste du consultant IDC.

President Muhammadu Buhari has, since taking office in 2015, sought help from several nations to recover money he said was taken from public coffers.

It is not immediately clear who deposited the money in Britain. The money was frozen at the request of prosecutors as a result of an Italian investigation. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by British authorities.

The investigations into the $1.3 billion sale in 2011 of oil prospecting licence (OPL) 245, which could hold more than 9 billion barrels of oil, have involved Italian, Nigerian and Dutch authorities and two of the world’s largest international oil companies.

It was initially awarded in 1998 to Malabu Oil and Gas before Royal Dutch Shell and Eni were awarded the rights in 2011 for $1.3 billion.

Shell has said it was aware that some of the payments it made to Nigeria for rights to the oilfield would go to Malabu, a company associated with former Nigerian oil minister and convicted money launderer Dan Etete.

“Nigeria had recently recovered the sum of $85 million from the controversial Malabu Restrained Funds from United Kingdom,” said the office of the attorney general, Abubakar Malam, in a statement late on Thursday based on his remarks at an asset recovery event in the capital, Abuja.

The money is part of funds related to OPL 245 payments that have been frozen in bank accounts around the world.

In the same statement, the attorney general’s office said negotiations with Switzerland on the repatriation of $321 million stolen by former military leader Sani Abacha had concluded.

He said a memorandum of understanding would be signed in early December and repatriation of the funds would follow a few weeks later.

Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, has accused Abacha of stealing up to $5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country, from 1993 until he died in 1998.",Nigeria recovers $85 mln deposited in Britain in oil licence deal funds - attorney general,https://www.reuters.com/article/investingNews/idAFKBN1CW1VM-OZABS

Twitter also accused two Russian media outlets of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism it had not done enough to deter international meddling.

The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances.

In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August.

According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China.

Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.”

“The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said.

Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.”

“As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.”

Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.

She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.”

“It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”

Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.",U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1CW2O0

Secretary Marcelo Caetano said the already watered-down bill is a “starting point” of revived talks with congressmen. Many legislators seeking re-election in October 2018 are reluctant to back the unpopular changes that would make Brazilians work for more years ahead of retirement.

The pension overhaul, seen by investors as crucial to plugging Brazil’s budget deficit, came close to a lower house vote in late May after months of discussions, but remained stalled for six months due to a corruption scandal involving President Michel Temer. Talks resumed this week after the lower house voted to reject a criminal charge against Temer.

“Time will tell what is going to happen, it will depend on the negotiations. The ideal reform, from a political perspective, is to approve the bill approved as it passed the congressional committee,” Caetano said.

The government’s proposal cleared the committee on May 3 by 23 votes to 14 after the government agreed to reduce planned savings from the measure by 25 percent, to about 600 billion reais over 10 years.

Many key legislators, including lower house speaker Rodrigo Maia, have called for an even weaker overhaul as Temer’s support base seems too small to approve constitutional reforms. The bar for the current pension reform is 308 of 513 votes, whereas Temer received 251 votes in his favor against the charges this week.

Pessimism over Temer’s chances to pass sweeping reforms has started to creep into Brazilian markets after months of strong gains. The spread between yields on the government’s 2018 and 2023 local-currency debt, a gauge of medium-term uncertainty, hit a record high last week.

Caetano, however, warned against proposals being floated by legislators seeking alternatives to pass parts of the reform as ordinary law, which would require a smaller number of votes, as many changes that need to be made in the pension regime for public workers would still require constitutional amendments.

The secretary said the government prefers to put the pension reform to a vote only if it is confident it has secured a comfortable majority, but again repeated a decision will be up to Congress. “Ideally, we would like to see this approved by the end of the year.”",Brazil sees pension bill as 'starting point' in renewed talks,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economy-pensions/brazil-sees-pension-bill-as-starting-point-in-renewed-talks-idUSKBN1CW2LM?il=0

FILE PHOTO: A street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York, February 10, 2009. REUTERS/Eric Thayer (UNITED STATES)

The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX is up nearly 6 percent from its August lows as the Trump administration has rolled out its tax reform proposal, which would cut corporate taxes to 20 percent from the current 35 percent and allow companies to bring back some of the $2.6 trillion in cash currently held offshore at reduced rates.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that a positive boost from taxes “had been priced out of stocks” in July but “has been making a solid comeback.”

Yet there are signs that the Trump administration has little room for error as it gets ready to introduce its tax legislation next week. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget measure on Thursday necessary for a vote on a tax bill, with Republicans from such high-tax states as New York and New Jersey among the opponents out of concerns that a bill would eliminate the deduction of state and local taxes.

Trump must also stem potential revolts over a proposal to scale back the level of tax-deferred contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans, which many middle-class Americans rely on for their retirement.

“The nature of the rally over the last two months has been tax-cut led. If we don’t get a cut then the market is going down” several percentage points, said Edward Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.

Such a decline would be the first significant sell-off of the year, he said, but would not likely be near the 20 percent decline that signifies the start of a bear market.

A collapse in the tax measure would likely send the S&P 500 down 5 percent or more, Goldman Sachs said in an Oct. 20 note.

“Tax reform will determine the direction of the S&P 500’s next 100 points,” the report said.

Over the last 30 days, roughly 75 companies - ranging from delivery service United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) - have discussed how they would benefit from a corporate tax cut on conference calls with analysts, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings call transcripts, a sign that Wall Street is increasingly focused on the tax bill.

The White House’s plan would boost 2018 S&P 500 adjusted earnings per share by 12 percent, to $156, Goldman Sachs estimates, while leading to an additional $75 billion in stock buybacks.

Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said that Trump’s clashes over the last week with members of his own party could threaten the tax bill’s success because it could alienate other Republicans. Because Republicans hold only a slim 52-48 seat advantage in the Senate, Trump can afford to lose only two votes.

“When the possibility of a defection of some Republican senators increases, that kind of puts the whole tax reform thing in jeopardy. He needs them all,” Tuz said.

At the same time, the 14.4 percent year-to-date rally in the S&P 500 leaves the index primed for a decline of at least 5 percent, said Barry James, a co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund (GLRBX.O).

The S&P 500 trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 22.6, and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5, both well above their historical norms.

“We’re at levels today that are historically very risky for stocks and we’re primed for a correction,” James said. “If there’s not the tax cut that everyone is expecting, then the correction could be a whole lot more serious.”","As Trump tax comes to floor, failure could spell stocks selloff",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/as-trump-tax-comes-to-floor-failure-could-spell-stocks-selloff-idUSKBN1CW1EV

The S&P technology index led the way higher, up 3.14 percent. The index was on track for its best day since March 1, 2016 and is up nearly 35 percent on the year versus the 15.2 percent gain in the S&P 500.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) gained 5.30 percent as its revenue got a boost from advertising sales. Microsoft (MSFT.O) jumped 7.16 percent after the world’s largest software company reported further gains from its cloud computing services.

Further lifting the sector were shares of Apple (AAPL.O), which rose 3.83 percent after the company allayed concerns of muted demand for its 10th anniversary phone. Intel (INTC.O) soared 8.10 percent after its quarterly results topped estimates and the chipmaker raised its full-year forecasts.

Amazon (AMZN.O), up 13.15 percent, was responsible for the biggest boost to the S&P 500 after reporting a quarterly sales surge. Its gains helped lift the consumer discretionary sector 1.53 percent to put the index on pace for its best daily performance since Dec. 7.

“People are concerned about overvaluation, people are concerned about what is the catalyst for those guys to attract too much attention from regulators,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.

“They are the ones that everyone wants to own, has to own because they are the ones reporting the best earnings. They definitely came through, that is very positive.”

Adding to the positive sentiment was the third-quarter GDP data that showed the U.S. economy unexpectedly maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a 3-percent annual rate, despite a hurricane-led drop in consumer spending and construction activities.

A report about President Donald Trump favoring Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the head of the U.S. central bank provided support for stocks. In Powell’s potential appointment, investors see a continuation of the current monetary policy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 36 points, or 0.15 percent, to 23,436.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 21.22 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,581.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 147.33 points, or 2.25 percent, to 6,704.10.

Earnings growth for the third quarter is now 6.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 273 companies that have posted earnings, 74 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 72 percent beat rate over the past four quarters.

Not all earnings were positive, however. Chevron’s (CVX.N) 4.53 percent fall weighed on the S&P and the Dow after the oil company’s profit missed estimates.

Merck (MRK.N) dropped 6.58 percent after the company reported a revenue drop due to a cyber attack and loss of market share for many of its older drugs.

The journalists - Lau Hon Meng from Singapore and Mok Choy Lin from Malaysia - were being questioned at a police station in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw after being detained in the morning, a local police officer told Reuters.

About 25 police staged an evening raid on the Yangon house of their Myanmar interpreter, well-known local reporter Aung Naing Soe, seizing his computer memory sticks and searching his documents.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled majority-Buddhist Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown.

In early September, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the death of the Rohingya in Myanmar constituted a “genocide” aimed at Muslim communities in the region.

Shwe Thaung, an officer from the Naypyitaw police station No.1, where the four were being detained, confirmed the basic facts of the incident but declined to elaborate, including on whether any charges had been filed, citing an ongoing investigation.

“We are still investigating and can’t say more than that,” Shwe Thaung said.

Myanmar state broadcaster MRTV said the journalists did not have permission to film the parliament with a drone. It showed their journalist visas and said the ministry of foreign affairs had informed the Singaporean and Malaysian embassies about the matter.

Turkish state broadcaster TRT could not immediately be reached for comment.

Several journalists in Myanmar have been arrested this year, leading rights groups to warn that the gains made in press freedom since the end of military rule risk being reversed under the rule of national leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Local journalist Aung Naing Soe has worked with many international media on the country’s transition to democracy after nearly five decades of military dictatorship.

His mother Thandar told Reuters police searched the house for computers and papers and asked for identification documents, and took Aung Naing Soe’s memory sticks. The police also tried but failed to open his computer, she said.

“I asked them to show me the search warrant. But the police said they didn’t need to do that because they were not searching for drugs,” Thandar said.

An administrator from Yangon’s Mingalar Taung Nyunt district, Ye Win Tun, who took part in the raid, confirmed that the police did not have a warrant but also said they did not need one.

“The search warrant would be necessary if they were searching for drugs or illegal card games, but in this instance it’s OK if the local administrator is there,” said Ye Win Tun.

The 20-second video, widely circulated on social media last year, shows the victim, Victor Mlotshwa, cowering inside a coffin as one man pushes the lid down and the other threatens to put petrol and a snake inside.

The defendants - Theo Jackson, sentenced to 14 years, and Willem Oosthuizen, sentenced to 11 years - had pleaded not guilty. They said they had caught Mlotshwa trespassing on their farm in possession of stolen copper cables.

The case, heard at a court in Middelburg, about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, Pretoria, has caused outrage in a country where deep racial divides persist 23 years after the end of apartheid.

When she handed down the sentences, Judge Segopotje Mphahlele said she was appalled that the accused had put Mlotshwa into a coffin.

“The evidence before court indicates that the seriousness of the offence far outweighs the mitigating factors and the personal factors of the offenders,” she said. “The conduct of the accused fueled social division and racial tension.”

The defense immediately requested that it be allowed to appeal the sentence, but Mphahlele dismissed their application.

The defense then said it would lodge their appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal, saying that the sentence was too harsh, since no one had been killed.

South Africa’s Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the sentence could serve as a deterrent to others.

“South Africa is no longer prepared to treat racism with kid gloves and we are ready to act,” Justice Minister Michael Masutha said in an interview with eNCA.

A large crowd formed outside the packed courtroom. The police presence around the court was heavy.

A blockbuster deal with Airbus SE (AIR.PA) that saw the European company take control of the CSeries for $1 leaves Bombardier’s commercial aviation division with the soft-selling turboprop and regional jets lines.

Meanwhile, on the rail side, Bombardier recently lost out on a merger with Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and now faces off against China’s merged rail company CRRC Corp (601766.SS) and a soon-to-be-formed European giant in Siemens-Alstom.

Macquarie on Friday said it would tweak 2019 company valuations to focus on corporate jets and rail, in the wake of the Airbus deal and media speculation on further commercial aircraft sales.

While the Airbus partnership boosts the CSeries and potentially Bombardier’s small aerostructures and engineering division, which produces aircraft components, the remaining lines in its commercial aerospace arm are “mature and stay stable at best as the industry changes around them,” according to AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray.

Removal of the CSeries headache means the company can focus on its more profitable rail and business jet divisions.

Yet even there, concerns remain with Moody’s this week downgrading Bombardier partly on “longer-term concerns” about the competitiveness of its rail business and concerns about its “future in the commercial aircraft space.” Bombardier said Moody’s action was “ill-founded.”

Bombardier’s CEO Alain Bellemare said recently the firm continues to weigh options for the rail unit. Asked about the future of the commercial aerospace unit on Oct. 20, he told reporters, “Right now the focus is to keep on selling these aircraft.”

“I think they will be forced to take a decision (to) either fix, coast or sell,” U.S. analyst Richard Aboulafia said of the commercial plane unit. “But fix means putting some serious money into product upgrades.”

Upgrading a regional jet with a new engine and wings would cost upwards of $1 billion, an amount likely to be prohibitive for the company as it spends on ramping up its CSeries and bringing its strong-selling Global 7000 to market, analysts say.

Bombardier has long weighed a sale or partnership venture to boost orders for its Q400 prop planes, which trail European rival ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo SpA (LDOF.MI). Such a deal, however, would be complicated by the need to ensure Canadian job security because the aircraft are assembled in Canada, government and union sources said.

Bombardier tried unsuccessfully in 2013 to sell 100 Q400 turboprops in Russia and set up a joint-venture assembly line there.

All solid-state battery technology is a next-generation, high-capacity energy storage device that improves on today’s lithium-ion batteries, replacing the liquid or gel-form electrolyte with a solid, conductive material.

Among other benefits, the new technology offers more capacity and better safety.

“There are a few next-generation battery technologies we’re looking at, and the most promising is an all solid-state battery,” Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada said in an interview ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show, which opened to the public on Friday.

“We’re scrambling to finish developing this technology, but a few issues still remain as we try to mass produce this.”

Battery life is the biggest of those issues, Uchiyamada said, adding Toyota has developed the know-how to produce all solid-state batteries in such a way as to hit all the technology’s performance potential.

But it hasn’t yet mastered how to mass produce them to last as intended for a mainstream car that some buyers could expect to drive for 200,000 kms (124,274 miles) or more.

Uchiyamada would not say how long an electric-vehicle (EV) battery should last before it needs replacing, but he dismissed a lifespan of three years. “Nobody would buy a car like that, if you had to replace the battery after just three years,” he said.

Toyota, though, appears confident it can complete the commercialization process for the new battery technology.

“We believe our solid-state battery technology can be a game changer, with the potential to dramatically improve driving range,” Executive Vice President Didier Leroy told reporters on Wednesday.

While Toyota is still pushing its alternative hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle technology, derided by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk, Uchiyamada insisted the Japanese firm is not “anti-EV”, and is spending heavily in EV technologies such as the solid-state battery.

Dubbed the “Father of the Prius,” Uchiyamada, 71, helped set the global auto industry on its path to electrification two decades ago, and believes both electric-battery cars and those with hydrogen fuel-cell technologies will be needed to ultimately replace gasoline cars.

BIGGER CAPACITY, BETTER SAFETY

Toyota believes solid-state battery technology can double the capacity of today’s lithium-ion battery technology, and help EVs travel further on a full charge.

The significance of the battery’s higher capacity, or energy density, is the potential for Toyota to reduce manufacturing costs for an EV’s battery propulsion system. High battery capacity means the technology needs less lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel or aluminum, allowing automakers to reduce the overall size of an EV propulsion system.

“In automotive manufacturing, smaller and lighter generally means cheaper to produce,” another Toyota official said.

Successfully commercializing solid-state battery technology could be key to making electric battery cars as affordable as today’s gasoline cars. Experts say this means the cost of producing a kilowatt hour of electricity needs to fall to around $100 from a little under $200/kWh today.

Global automakers are racing to lower battery manufacturing costs to pad out today’s thin margins on battery cars.

“We see this tipping point around 2025,” says Nissan Motor Co 7210.T Executive Vice President Daniele Schillaci.

“By then, for the customer, it will be practically the same cost to buy petrol or EV. If you have the same price for EVs and petrol, why would you buy traditional technology?”

All solid-state battery technology should also be safer - as conventional lithium-ion batteries with liquid or a gel-like electrolyte have been known to leak or can ignite when they short-circuit and overheat. These risks are reduced in solid-state batteries, says Uchiyamada.

And, unlike today’s lithium-ion batteries, solid-state battery cells don’t need to be layered closely together and linked by electric connectors, giving car designers more flexibility to create more space for passengers or storage.

“I’d say that’s fairly revolutionary, and I‘m sure others are looking at solid-state lithium-ion battery technology to break out of the pack and come up with a safer and more potent energy storage technology,” Uchiyamada said.",Toyota scrambles to ready 'game-changer' EV battery for mass market,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-autoshow-tokyo-toyota-battery/toyota-scrambles-to-ready-game-changer-ev-battery-for-mass-market-idUKKBN1CW27S

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances.

In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August.

According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China.

Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.”

“The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said.

Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.”

“As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.”

Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.

She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.”

“It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.”

Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.",U.S. seeks meeting soon to revive Asia-Pacific 'Quad' security forum,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asia-quad/u-s-seeks-meeting-soon-to-revive-asia-pacific-quad-security-forum-idUSKBN1CW2O1?il=0

In Pakistan, “bailable arrest warrants” often act as a warning to deter absences from court, but a judge can later issue non-bailable warrants that are more serious and could see Sharif arrested when he returns to Pakistan.

Sharif missed the hearing as he is undertaking a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, Dawn and other English-language newspapers reported. Sharif had spent previous weeks tending to his wife in London, where she is receiving cancer treatment.

Sharif faces three separate corruption charges from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), an anti-corruption body which has its own courts. Sharif’s two sons and his daughter Maryam, who is viewed as Sharif’s heir-apparent, are also facing NAB trials.

Sharif, 67, resigned in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.

The Sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable. The army denies playing a role.

“We are going through a time in Pakistan where speaking up against injustice is called contempt of court and speaking up for the nation is called treason, but I still believe that we will be victorious,” Maryam said outside the court, according to Dawn newspaper.

Sharif had a representative in court.

Sharif’s disqualification stemmed from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy flats in London.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots.
On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.
Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.",Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-recovery/born-again-blackberry-canadian-icon-hopes-to-ride-trucks-to-growth-idUSKBN1901P1

La croissance de l'économie américaine a été plus forte que prévu au troisième trimestre, à 3,0% en rythme annualisé, selon les données en première estimation publiées vendredi par le département du Commerce. /Photo d'archives/REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo

Le produit intérieur brut (PIB) des Etats-Unis a connu une croissance de 3,0% en rythme annualisé entre juillet et septembre, contre 3,1% enregistrés au deuxième trimestre, selon les données en première estimation publiées vendredi par le département du Commerce.

Les économistes interrogés par Reuters attendaient une progression du PIB américain de 2,5% sur la période.

Le département du Commerce a souligné qu‘il lui était impossible d‘estimer l‘impact global du passage des ouragans Harvey et Irma, qui ont dévastés le sud des Etats-Unis en août et septembre, sur ces chiffres trimestriels du PIB.

Il a cependant annoncé que, selon les premières estimations, ces ouragans avaient causé 121 milliards de dollars (104,4 milliards d‘euros) de pertes d‘actifs immobilisés privés et 10,4 milliards d‘immobilisations publiques.

“C‘est un rapport positif pour l‘économie qui a été frappée par deux ouragans à la fin du trimestre mais il n‘est pas aussi bon que le chiffre affiché de 3,0% de croissance ne le laisse paraître”, a dit John Ryding, économiste chez RDQ Economics.

Hors constitution des stocks, la croissance de l‘économie américaine a été de 2,3% en rythme annualisé sur la période juillet-septembre, contre 2,9% sur les trois mois précédents.

LE DOLLAR S‘EST RAFFERMI APRÈS CES CHIFFRES DU PIB

Sachant que les indicateurs sur l‘emploi, les ventes de détail et la production industrielle après les ouragans témoignent déjà de signes d‘accélération de l‘activité, le rapport mitigé de vendredi ne devrait pas avoir d‘impact sur la politique monétaire américaine à court terme.

La présidente de la Réserve fédérale, Janet Yellen, a averti en septembre que la croissance du troisième trimestre serait freinée par les graves perturbations dues aux ouragans.

La banque centrale américaine devrait relever ses taux d‘intérêt pour la troisième fois de l‘année en décembre.

En réaction à cette première estimation du PIB, le dollar a accru ses gains face à un panier de devises de référence, touchant un pic de trois mois. Sur le marché obligataire, le rendement des Treasuries à deux ans a touché un pic de neuf ans. Wall Street a débuté en hausse, soutenue par ailleurs par de bons résultats de plusieurs géants de la technologie.

La reprise économique après la récession en 2007-2009 est entrée dans sa huitième année et montre peu de signes d‘essoufflement. L‘économie est portée par l‘amélioration du marché du travail, qui a démarré pendant le premier mandat de l‘ancien président Barack Obama, et qui ne se dément pas depuis.

Bien que les marchés d‘actions aient grimpé en perspective de la réforme fiscale promise par Donald Trump, la nouvelle administration n‘a pas encore commencé à concrétiser ses projets. Le président table sur une croissance annuelle de 3% grâce aux baisses d‘impôts et à un assouplissement de la réglementation.

IMPACT POSITIF DES STOCKS

Les entreprises américaines ont accumulé des stocks à un rythme de 35,8 milliards de dollars au troisième trimestre, en perspective d‘une forte demande. En conséquence, les investissements pour constitution de stocks ont contribué à hauteur de 0,73 point de pourcentage à la croissance du troisième trimestre, après seulement 0,10 point au deuxième.

Les exportations ont augmenté à un rythme de 2,3%, tandis que les importations ont baissé de 0,8%. Cette évolution a fait baisser le déficit commercial, ce qui a permis au commerce extérieur de contribuer à hauteur de 0,41 point de pourcentage à la croissance du PIB. Il s‘agit du troisième trimestre consécutif d‘impact positif du commerce.

Harvey et Irma, qui ont affecté les revenus et les ventes de détail en août, ont freiné les dépenses de consommation au troisième trimestre. La croissance de ces dépenses, qui représentent plus des deux tiers de l‘activité économique des Etats-Unis, a ralenti, à 2,4% contre 3,3% au deuxième trimestre.

En dépit de la modération des dépenses, l‘inflation a rebondi, probablement du fait des perturbations dans la chaîne d‘approvisionnement causées par le passage des tempêtes.

L‘indice PCE “Core”, hors alimentation et énergie, la mesure privilégiée de l‘inflation de la Fed, a augmenté de 1,3%, après avoir progressé nettement moins, de 0,9%, au deuxième trimestre.

Compte tenu de l‘accélération de l‘inflation, le revenu disponible des ménages n‘a augmenté que de 0,6%, en net repli par rapport à la hausse de 3,3% du trimestre précédent.

Les investissements immobiliers non-résidentiels ont baissé de 5,2% au troisième trimestre, plus net recul en deux ans, tandis que les dépenses minières ont augmenté de 21,7%, en forte décélération par rapport aux 116,3% du deuxième trimestre.

Les investissements sur le marché du logement, qui étaient déjà freinés par les pénuries de terrain et de main-d‘oeuvre, ont également souffert des ouragans, en baisse de 6,0%.

Les investissements industriels ont augmenté de 8,6%, en hausse pour un quatrième trimestre d‘affilée, alors que les investissements publics ont baissé pour un troisième trimestre consécutif.

Particularly since Congress, which is empowered to write American laws, declined to make similar changes to the Obama-era health law when Trump urged legislators to do so, most of the framers of the Constitution would presumably be appalled by these actions. Yet this is not just a problem with the current president. The expansion, and sometimes misuse, of executive power is a result produced in large measure by the framers’ choices to dilute accountability and responsibility in the federal government, and their designing a presidential system in which a minority party can regularly win.

Trump has mounted a two-pronged attack on the ACA following the failure of legislative repeal efforts. First, he issued an order that will weaken the regulations in the ACA requiring private insurance to cover certain essential services. This will allow some consumers to purchase cheaper plans that don’t cover very much. A subset of young and healthy people will have lower premiums, but premiums will shoot up for everyone else, as the market of people buying decent insurance becomes older and sicker. (And, of course, for young people who end up needing expensive medical treatment, what looks like a bargain will turn into a disaster.)

We know exactly how this will play out because Tennessee has used a loophole to allow barebones insurance to be offered to consumers. After weeding out the young and healthy, Tennessee’s market offers among the nation’s highest premiums on its health insurance exchange.

Although Trump’s order has no justification as public policy, it is probably legal. Barack Obama issued numerous executive orders designed to implement the Affordable Care Act, as well as taking aggressive action on issues like immigration and climate change after Congress failed to act. Given the complexity of the regulatory state and the strong tendency of Congress to gridlock, a rigid conception of executive power would probably be worse for democratic accountability and functioning governance. Policy-wise, there’s no equivalence between Obama’s attempts to make the Affordable Care Act work as intended and Trump’s explicit attempts to sabotage it. But in terms of formal executive power, there’s ample precedent for Trump’s actions. Legal challenges to Obama’s actions suspending some of the ACA’s regulations never got any traction.

Trump’s second action is even worse as policy and it also has a shakier legal foundation. Trump announced that he was ending subsidy payments to insurers that would give them incentives to cover poorer and sicker people without raising premiums on others. People buying insurance will bear the brunt of the action through higher premiums or deductibles. Since more buyers will be eligible for subsidies, the perverse effect of the action will be to insure fewer people while spending more money. (The funding might be restored by Congress: Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have reached a deal in which Republicans will be bribed not to end the payments if states are given more leeway to loosen the law’s insurance market regulations. Trump supports the agreement, although it is not yet clear if it will have the votes to pass the Senate or House.)

The withholding of payments presents potential legal problems. Nineteen state attorneys general filed suit against the administration, arguing that the administration did not comply with the procedures necessary to stop the payments promised by the law, and also that the action violated the “take care” clause of Article II. The former argument in particular is not frivolous, but the potential of these lawsuits is unclear.

While this kind of executive policymaking is not what the framers had in mind, it’s still going to become more common. The American separation-of-powers system always tends towards stasis. There are so many choke points: a bicameral legislature, the Senate filibuster, the presidential veto, and judicial review. When Congress is unable to act, executive power is likely to fill the vacuum.

The problem is compounded by the various ways in which the Constitution distorts democratic choice. Because of factors like vote suppression, gerrymandering, nearly unlimited campaign spending, and institutions that over-represent white rural voters such as the Senate and the Electoral College, Republicans have been able to lose the popular vote and still win elections. Winner-take-all elections, instead of proportional representation, mean that the slimmest of victories puts total power in the hands of the officeholders who did not attract many voters. Racially and culturally-polarized politics mean that most rank-and-file Republicans pull the lever for the party despite not agreeing with much of its economic agenda. Once in office, Republicans are committed to policies, such as the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, that appease the Republican donor class and the activist base, but not most Republican voters and certainly not Democrats and independents.

Republican Congresses are left incapable of fulfilling their incoherent campaign promises, such as repealing Obamacare’s regulations and subsidies without taking insurance away from millions of Americans. Caught between their base’s demand to repeal, even without a meaningful replacement, but fearing the wrath of voters in more moderate states, they ended up passing nothing. The inevitable outcome is the Republican president, elected by a minority and unconcerned with reaching beyond his base, enacting the right-wing’s demands by fiat.

When considering Trump’s randomly destructive style of policymaking, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 the plurality of American voters chose Hillary Clinton, the candidate who promised to faithfully execute the Affordable Care Act, only to be denied their choice by a mechanism the Constitution’s authors intended in part to curb “excessive democracy.” The framers feared the powers of the executive branch being abused, but the system they designed has allowed it to happen.",Commentary: Blame the Constitution for Trump’s undemocratic executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lemieux-executive-commentary/commentary-blame-the-constitution-for-trumps-undemocratic-executive-orders-idUSKBN1CN2NR

Twitter also accused two Russian media outlets of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism it had not done enough to deter international meddling.

The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.

Bloomberg News reported earlier on Friday that Trump was leaning toward nominating Powell, citing three sources.

Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.

He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3.

Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact a big tax cut package. Warsh’s star also has faded, according to media accounts.

Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank position, which has dimmed prospects for him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said.

In an interview with Fox Business Network last Friday, Trump indicated he could nominate both Powell and Taylor for top jobs at the central bank.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau, under fire in recent days over conflict-of-interest allegations, pointed to stronger-than-expected economic growth as proof the Liberal strategy of deficit spending had paid dividends in the two years since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a surprise majority.

“So now, with a little more wind in our sails, we’re doubling down on a plan with proven results and reinvesting in the middle class,” Morneau said in a speech to parliament.

The government has been badly shaken by charges that Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell (MSI.TO), was in a conflict of interest because he did not place his holdings in a blind trust, but hopes the fiscal update will reset pubic focus on the strong economy.

The deficit was projected to shrink to C$19.9 billion this year from C$28.5 billion projected in the March budget, but the improvement included a reduction in the government’s so-called fiscal cushion to C$1.5 billion from C$3 billion in March.

The budget shortfall was forecast to shrink further, to C$18.6 billion next year and to C$12.5 billion by the end of the budget’s five-year horizon in 2022-23. Each of those years included a C$3 billion fiscal cushion, a risk adjustment that economists consider prudent.

Morneau’s update had little impact on financial markets, but the additional stimulus may give the Bank of Canada more room to continue to hike interest rates, though no move is expected at the bank’s next policy decision on Wednesday.

“You kind of have a hand off from monetary policy to the federal government by way of fiscal stimulus,” said Scott Smith, managing partner at Viewpoint Investment Partners. “If you can thread the needle, then it’s a great strategy ... the challenge comes if there’s a hiccup in any link of the chain as it pertains to either monetary or fiscal policy.”

Morneau said the government would strengthen the child benefit by indexing it to inflation from next July, a pledge that will cost C$5.6 billion over five years, and increase the tax benefit for low-income workers.

He forecast GDP growth to slow to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.6 percent in 2019, from 3.1 percent this year.

Together with the smaller deficits, the growth would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 30.5 percent this year from 31.2 in 2016-2017 and gradually to 28.5 percent by 2022-23, better than most G7 rivals.","Canada to unveil smaller budget deficit, hopes will shift focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1CT2WG-OCADN

An Interior Ministry statement gave no details on the militants, but Egyptian forces have been battling several armed Islamist groups, mostly focused on an entrenched Islamic State affiliate that has killed hundreds of police officers and troops in the northern Sinai Peninsula since 2013.

“They took a house in the farm as a temporary hideout faraway from security monitoring to receive newly recruited elements and train them and prepare the explosive devices,” the ministry statement said.

The clashes were in an area near the Assuit-Kharga desert highway, around 400 km (248.55 miles) southwest of Cairo, in New Valley province that shares a long border with neighboring southern Libya. Southern Libya has become a hideout for militant brigades taking advantage of the security vacuum there.

After clashes with the militants, the ministry said 13 bodies were recovered at the farm, some wearing militant uniforms. Security forces also recovered weapons, suicide bomb belts, cash and ammunition.

The statement did not say whether the group was linked to the militants who attacked police last week in a remote area of Giza governorate, 135 km outside Cairo, when sources say they were searching for a militant hideout.

“Security forces dealt a severe blow to the terrorist elements in revenge for the blood of the men who were martyred last week in the oasis,” the state news agency MENA said earlier, citing a high-level security source.

Most of Egypt’s violence is centered in the northern Sinai, where a local group, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. It had mostly targeted security forces with ambushes and suicide attacks, but has spread to other areas of Egypt outside the peninsula.

The western desert region has long been for a route for smugglers and arms coming across Libya’s porous border.

Sustained earnings growth will give China’s policymakers more room to restructure bloated and often inefficient state-owned enterprises, which dominate the industrial landscape and account for a hefty portion of the country’s corporate debt.

Industrial profits in September rose 27.7 percent from a year earlier to 662.18 billion yuan ($99.46 billion), accelerating from a 24 percent jump in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Friday.

That was the sharpest monthly gain since December 2011, when profits leapt 31.5 percent.

The NBS attributed the September surge to stronger growth in production and sales and higher prices for manufactured goods, as well as a pick-up in earnings in sectors such as electricity, alcohol and electronics.

“We predict the industrial sector will remain on a steady, improving trajectory in the fourth quarter,” Zheng Lixin, a spokesman for the industry ministry, told a media briefing.

For the first nine months of the year, the firms notched up profits of 5.58 trillion yuan, a 22.8 percent jump from the same period last year and up a touch from January-August.

Industrial firms’ liabilities increased 6.7 percent in September on-year, compared with a rise of 6.4 percent in the first eight months of the year.

While a year-long construction boom is starting to show signs of fatigue, still robust industrial earnings will be good news for the country’s leaders who gathered for a key Communist Party Congress over the past week to set political and economic priorities for the next five years.

President Xi Jinping opened the gathering stressing the need to move from high-speed to high-quality growth.

While reiterating a commitment to give market forces freer rein in the world’s second-largest economy, Xi also said the government would strengthen the role of state firms, raising questions about whether Beijing will pursue painful reforms in the sector which some analysts say are long overdue.

PRICES KEY TO PROFIT OUTLOOK

Market watchers had expected solid September earnings after producer prices rose by a higher-than-forecast 6.9 percent on-year, boosted by strong demand for building materials.

Most analysts have maintained those price gains and industrial profits would start to moderate in coming months as measures to cool China’s heated housing market and a government crackdown on riskier lending starts to bite.

But commodity prices got a fresh leg up in recent weeks as the government pressed ahead with efforts to reduce notorious winter smog, urging major northern industrial cities to slash steel output ahead of the official winter heating season.

That has spurred fears of shortages and pushed up steel prices, but is having the opposite effect on steelmaking raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal, which are sliding on worries about a supply glut.

China’s steel output dropped in September from a record high in August as mills cut production in line with Beijing’s campaign for clearer skies.

Beijing was already in the midst of a multi-year campaign to shutter older, inefficient plants and reduce profit-draining industrial overcapacity, though many analysts say they are merely being replaced with newer, cleaner factories and the country’s excess capacity issue have not been fully addressed.

Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (601600.SS) announced a plan on Thursday to bring up to 16 billion yuan of investment into some subsidiaries after posting a more than 10-fold rise in nine-month profit. Chalco is the listed arm of China’s biggest state-run aluminum firm, Chinalco.

“MAN OF STEEL”

A breakdown of the profit data showed heavy industry continued to reap most of the benefits from the building boom, which is also being driven by heavy government infrastructure spending.

Mining industry profits surged 473.8 percent in January-September on-year, and manufacturing profits rose 19.6 percent.

Earnings in the mining industry soared 5.9 times last month from a year earlier, but sectors such as electricity, gas and water production saw their profits fall 18.3 percent.

China’s economy has surprised analysts with robust growth so far this year, with the rebound in its industrial sector contributing to a reflationary pulse that has boosted manufacturing worldwide.

Though GDP growth slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in the third quarter, senior officials said last week that the economy is still on track to meet the official growth target of around 6.5 percent for the full year, despite the punishing war on pollution.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the July-September period, also supported by strong business spending on equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. With inventories, goods yet to be sold, contributing almost three-quarters of a percentage point to growth last quarter, the increase in GDP overstates the economy’s health.

Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarter’s 2.9 percent pace. A measure of domestic demand also decelerated to a 2.2 percent growth rate from the April-June period’s 3.3 percent pace.

“This is a positive report for an economy that was battered by two hurricanes late in the quarter but it is not as strong as the headline 3.0 percent growth might suggest,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The economy grew at a 3.1 percent pace in the second quarter. It was the first time since 2014 that it experienced growth of 3 percent or more for two quarters in a row. Economists had forecast GDP increasing at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter.

The government said while it was impossible to estimate the overall impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on third-quarter GDP, preliminary estimates showed that the back-to-back storms had caused losses of $121.0 billion in privately owned fixed assets and $10.4 billion in government-owned fixed assets.

Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Hurricane Maria, which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, had no impact on third-quarter GDP growth as the islands are not included in the United States’ national accounts.

Post-hurricane labor market, retail sales and industrial production data already show an acceleration in underlying economic activity. Economists expect the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates for a third time this year in December.

“Fed officials will be encouraged by both the overall performance and the composition of growth in the third quarter, which confirms the U.S. economic expansion remains on solid ground,” said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

The dollar rose to a three-month high against a basket of currencies on the data. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest rate sensitive two-year note touching a fresh nine-year high. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.

The economic recovery since the 2007-2009 recession is now in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue. The economy is being powered by a tightening labor market, which has largely maintained a strong performance that started during former President Barack Obama’s first term.

Though U.S. stocks have risen in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s tax reform, the administration has yet to enact any significant new economic policies. Trump wants big tax cuts and fewer regulations to boost annual GDP growth to 3 percent.

INVENTORY BOOST

Businesses accumulated inventories at a $35.8 billion pace in the third quarter, leading to inventory investment adding 0.73 percentage point to third-quarter GDP growth. Inventories contributed just over a tenth of a percentage point to output in the prior period. Economists expect a modest boost from inventories in the fourth quarter.

Though export growth slowed in the last quarter, that was eclipsed by the steepest pace of decline in imports in three years, leaving a smaller trade deficit, which added four-tenths of a percentage point to GDP growth. Trade has contributed to output for three quarters in a row.

Business investment in equipment rose at an 8.6 percent rate, increasing for a fourth straight quarter. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, slowed to a 2.4 percent rate as hurricanes Harvey and Irma hurt incomes.

Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter and is likely to accelerate in the fourth quarter with a separate report on Friday showing consumer sentiment holding at lofty levels in October.

Despite the moderation in consumer spending, inflation perked up in the third quarter, likely as a result of disruptions to the supply chain caused by the hurricanes.

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 1.3 percent rate. That followed a 0.9 percent pace of increase in the second quarter.

With inflation rising, income at the disposal of households increased at a 0.6 percent rate, braking sharply from the second-quarter’s strong 3.3 percent pace.

Investment in nonresidential structures fell at a 5.2 percent pace in the third quarter, the biggest drop in nearly two years, as spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts grew at only a 21.7 percent rate, a sharp deceleration from the second-quarter’s 116.3 percent pace.

Investment in homebuilding, which was already undermined by land and labor shortages, contracted for a second consecutive quarter. Government investment recorded its third straight quarterly decline

“While hurricane effects are hard to parse out of the GDP data, we anticipate rebuilding efforts will lift residential investment out of the doldrums it has occupied the last two quarters,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.","Inventories, trade shield U.S. economy from hurricane headwinds",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/inventories-trade-shield-u-s-economy-from-hurricane-headwinds-idINKBN1CW1PE

A growing number of Canadians identifying themselves as indigenous, a higher fertility rate and a higher life expectancy for indigenous people than in the past help explain the rapid growth rate, Statistics Canada said.

Canada’s indigenous population grew 42.5 percent in the 10 years to 2016 to 1.7 million people, compared to 11 percent growth for Canada as a whole, Statistics Canada said, in data released from the 2016 census.

The findings show a young population, with an average age of 32.1 years, compared with 40.9 for the non-aboriginal population.

The census, which showed indigenous people accounting for nearly 5 percent of the population overall, also found a younger generation significantly more likely to be raised in foster care. Indigenous children made up 7.7 percent of all Canadians under 5 but more than half of the children were in foster homes, according to the census data.

The census also found that one fifth of the indigenous population lives in over-crowded housing, and 44 percent of indigenous people on reserves were living in homes that needed major repairs.

Last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada had failed its indigenous people. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trudeau acknowledged the dark history of Canada’s colonization as one of “humiliation, neglect and abuse” and promised to do more.

Statistics Canada estimated that by 2036, indigenous people will comprise one-fifth of the populations of the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan - potentially giving them greater political clout.

Canada’s indigenous people come from hundreds of nations and bands, with more than 70 distinct languages. They include First Nations, Métis, people of mixed indigenous and European background, and Inuit, who largely inhabit Canada’s north.

Population growth between 2006 and 2016 was highest for Métis, at 51.2 percent. That appeared to result, at least in part, from more people calling themselves Métis rather than from a mushrooming Métis birth rate, Statistics Canada figures suggest.

In 2011, Métis women’s birth rate was just 12.5 percent higher than that of non-indigenous women.

The benchmark U.S. S&P500 index .SPX was up 0.8 percent late Friday, on track for it's biggest one day gain since Sept. 11 this year.

The Catalan parliament’s declaration of independence from Spain, made after a secret ballot, is now likely to be ruled illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.

“There’s no doubt that Catalonia, the issue has been weighing on the euro,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey.

Stronger-than-expected U.S. third-quarter GDP data helped bolster the dollar. The U.S. economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual rate from July to September, showing resilience even as recent storms hurt consumer spending.

The euro had its worst day against the U.S. dollar in 16 months on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would cut its bond purchases in half to 30 billion euros a month from January, maintaining an easy money policy well into next year.

“The dovish surprise from the ECB was its openness to extend the duration of its bond purchase program,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

Gold prices in India slipped to 29,209 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, the lowest level in about two months.

Prices in India were at a premium of up to $3 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, up from $2 last week. The slight increase in premiums was due to traders looking to cover for purchases made when rates were higher.

“After Diwali, demand falters every year. This year, even during Diwali demand was lower than usual,” said Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in Chennai.

Last week, Indians celebrated the Diwali and Dhanteras festivals, when buying bullion is considered auspicious.

“Jewellers have to replenish inventory after Diwali sales. Since prices are falling, they will do it very slowly,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank.

“In the last few days the government was selling gold bonds. Some investors are giving preference to bonds over physical gold due to tax benefits.”

Meanwhile, benchmark spot gold prices were headed for an about 1 percent weekly decline, having hit a near three-month low of $1,264.15 on Friday.

The drop in rates, however, failed to reignite interest for gold in most Asian hubs.

“In Singapore, several businesses in the region referred to as ‘Little India’ have said that the festival sales were not great and that it had come down when compared to the Diwali season in the last two years,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.

“Physical demand didn’t really pick up despite lower prices. While we did have businesses and individuals calling us today due to the price drop, prices had been stagnant for the rest of the week.”

Premiums of 50 cents were being charged over the benchmark in Singapore this week, unchanged from the previous week, while in Hong Kong, they rose to the 60 cents to $1.30 range, as against 50 cents last week.

“There are sporadic large transactions, by buyers who take advantage of the price level and the low premiums, but overall, the market is quiet,” said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner of J. Rotbart & Co in Hong Kong.

In top consumer China, premiums of $6.5-$10 an ounce were being charged over the benchmark, compared with $8-$12 in the previous week.

“There has been some amount of buying in China,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. He, however, said there seems to be a shift toward stocks rather than gold in terms of investments.

Oil prices have been hovering near their highest levels for this year amid signs of a tightening market, renewed support this week of an extension of production cuts and tensions in Iraq.

However, Friday’s announcement of a ceasefire between Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga from the country’s autonomous northern Kurdish region eased some concerns.

“What is interesting is that the pop in WTI futures moved above the Sept. 28 high,” said David Thompson, executive vice president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington, D.C.

“So even though the dollar is giving back some of its move, crude may now be trading off of a new driver, the technical breakthrough to a new high.”

The dollar trimmed its earlier gains versus a basket of currencies .DXY following a Bloomberg report that U.S. President Donald Trump is said to be leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as his pick to head the U.S. central bank.

A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities, including oil, cheaper for holders of other currencies.

“I think the combination of short covering and Chevron and Exxon both missing their production guidance for the third quarter has resulted in the market strength today,” said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP in Durham, North Carolina.

TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) said in a filing on Thursday that it is seeking to raise the temporary discounted spot rate for light crude on its 700,000 barrel-per-day Marketlink pipeline. The news sent WTI’s discount to global marker Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 to the widest in a month.

OPEC and other major producers including Russia have pledged to reduce production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to drain a global supply glut.

“If OPEC and their non-OPEC partners can agree to extend their production curtailments through 2018, then we estimate the oil market will remain in modest under-supply until 2019,” U.S. Investment bank Jefferies said.

Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question.","When Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt announced last week that his agency would repeal the Clean Power Plan, the Trump administration’s allies in the Republican Party and the coal industry hailed it as a major blow against over-regulation. Applauding Pruitt’s move, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the plan to stop power plants from dumping unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere ”a vast, unlawful expansion of government authority” into the energy sector that had been “especially devastating” to coal country.

The reality is different. Republicans say that deregulating carbon pollution will revive the coal industry, but it won’t. The decades-long decline in coal jobs reflects larger economic forces: mechanization, tapped-out coal veins in Appalachia, and stiffer competition from increasingly cheap energy production from solar panels, wind turbines, and natural gas. In the last decade, coal’s share of the U.S. energy portfolio declined from half to one-third. This predates the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet even taken effect.

The Trump administration may not even be able to repeal the Clean Power regulation. Liberal states and environmental groups already are lining up to challenge Pruitt’s plans in court. The federal government is legally obligated to limit carbon pollution and coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source. Unless Republicans change the law, they may be forced to uphold the plan. Anyway, the Democrats will reinstate the rule if they win back control of the White House.

Although Ryan called the Clean Power Plan a “signature climate rule” of the Obama administration, it was Republican President Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act of 1970, which requires EPA to regulate pollutants that endanger human health. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that clear evidence — some of it produced by the government’s own scientists — demonstrated that carbon emissions cause global warming, which in turn causes dangers such as smog, deadly heat waves, and hurricanes. Therefore, the court ruled that EPA had to regulate carbon.

George W. Bush stalled on implementation until the end of his administration, and Barack Obama spent his first few years in office trying to craft legislation in which the government would create a cap-and-trade program to regulate carbon. Because the Senate failed to pass cap-and-trade, the Obama administration eventually came up with the Clean Power Plan.

Even if Pruitt were able to convince courts that the Clean Power Plan’s costs outweigh its benefits – an argument for which environmentalists have plenty of counter-evidence – the EPA would still be obligated to come up with a replacement carbon pollution regulation. Courts could order EPA to produce a regulation by a certain time and hold Pruitt in contempt of court if he fails to comply. That’s what happened to EPA administrator William D. Ruckelshaus in 1984 for not issuing standards on radioactive airborne materials.

Although other regulatory rollbacks might trigger apoplexy among green organizations, in this case they say they are certain of victory. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, the largest U.S. environmental organization, while predicting that “Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health,” also noted, “No matter who is in the White House, EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution.”

To be sure, Pruitt’s plan represents a threat to the environment. Coal is the dirtiest major source of energy in the United States. In addition to contributing to climate change, it produces a host of toxins such as nitrous oxide and mercury and is a major source of smog. When it drafted the Clean Power rule, the EPA estimated that it would prevent 90,000 childhood asthma attacks, 300,000 missed work and school days, and 3,600 premature deaths per year by 2030. If the courts do let Pruitt repeal the rule, it could slow the transition away from coal, causing dirtier air and more global warming.

However, the only way to lastingly prevent carbon regulation would be to revise the Clean Air Act to stipulate that its standards do not apply to carbon. Republicans in Congress have tried to do just that. Their most recent bill, released in February, immediately attracted over 100 co-sponsors, all of them Republicans.

Preventing carbon regulation would be extremely unpopular. Polls show large majorities of the public, sometimes including a majority of Republican voters, support regulating climate pollution.

As David Doniger, director of the climate program at the left-leaning Natural Resources Defense Council and a former EPA official, told me in April for an article I wrote in The Washington Post: “After the Bush administration...the Clean Air Act was still in effect and the Obama administration started to set things right. It’s not a very satisfying thing to think of this as a 30-years war, but it’s longer than a four-year battle.”

Trump does have considerable political capital invested in the battle. In March, he issued an executive order directing Pruitt to get rid of the Clean Power rule. As a candidate, the president repeatedly promised to end his predecessor’s “war on coal” and put the miners back to work.

However, market realities will make this promise impossible to keep as coal’s slide continues. In 2016, natural gas passed coal as the leading source of American electricity, a shift the U.S. Energy Information Agency finds is “mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices.” There’s no sign of the fracking-driven cheap gas boom abating. In fact, Trump hopes to boost it by deregulating fracking on federal land. Whether governments will cut carbon pollution swiftly enough to stave off climate catastrophe remains an open question. But laws in place from a time when Republicans were more moderate will ultimately ensure that carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants is regulated — insufficient and late though it may be — and coal’s foreordained death will hardly have been slowed at all.",Commentary: EPA repeal of Clean Power Plan won’t get Trump what he wants,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adler-coal-commentary/commentary-epa-repeal-of-clean-power-plan-wont-get-trump-what-he-wants-idUSKBN1CT2TT

Lors d‘un discours à Cayenne, le chef de l‘Etat a souligné que les 30 mesures du plan d‘urgence adopté en avril par le précédent gouvernement étaient engagées, dont 23 déjà mises en oeuvre, ainsi que deux tiers des 164 mesures sectorielles décidées à l‘époque.

“L‘intégralité de ces deux premiers volets sur lesquels François Hollande s‘était engagé sera appliquée et la parole de l‘Etat sera tenue” a-t-il assuré. “Ces engagements étaient initialement chiffrés à un milliard d‘euros, ils représentent un milliard et demi de subvention d‘Etat à ce jour et s‘étaleront sur plusieurs années.”

Le troisième volet des accords, proposé par le collectif “Pou Lagwiyann dékolé” (Pour que la Guyane décolle) d‘un montant de 2,1 milliards d‘euros et acté par le précédent gouvernement, sera lui examiné, a-t-il ajouté.

“Je le dis ici très clairement : le rôle de l‘Etat n‘est pas de tenir des engagements irréalistes et n‘est en aucun cas de céder à des pressions quelles qu‘elles soient, en particulier lorsqu‘elles n‘ont pas la légitimité démocratique qui est celle portée par les élus”, a-t-il souligné, au lendemain d‘une marche organisée par le collectif à Cayenne.

Cette manifestation, qui a rassemblé plus d‘un millier de personnes dans l‘après-midi, a été émaillée dans la soirée d‘échauffourées entre manifestants et forces de l‘ordre, qui ont fait usage de gaz lacrymogène. Cinq personnes ont été interpellées.

“La Guyane subit des violences inacceptables” avec un taux d‘homicides dix fois supérieur à ce qu‘il est en métropole, a souligné Emmanuel Macron, jugeant que “la situation d‘insécurité qui s’est développée depuis plusieurs années” n’était pas soutenable.

Pour y faire face, le renforcement en cours des effectifs de police et de gendarmerie va être accéléré tout comme le projet de nouveau commissariat de Cayenne, annoncé “depuis plus de quinze ans” - la sélection de l’architecte sera lancée avant la fin de l’année.

“PAS LE PÈRE NOËL”

Au-delà de la question sécuritaire, le mouvement de contestation sociale de grande ampleur, qui a paralysé le département français en mars et en avril, portait également des revendications sanitaires et éducatives.

Au total, l‘Etat finance une dotation exceptionnelle de 250 millions d‘euros sur cinq ans pour la construction de dix collèges et cinq lycées, soit 50 millions d‘euros par an dès 2017, a souligné Emmanuel Macron.

Les engagements en matière de santé pris dans le cadre du plan d‘urgence ont eux été “intégralement tenus”, a-t-il assuré.

Concernant la lutte contre l‘orpaillage clandestin, une nouvelle organisation verra le jour dès le début de l‘année prochaine, avec l‘utilisation de drones et de nouveaux moyens aériens légers.

Pour réduire l’attractivité du territoire guyanais et ainsi l’immigration illégale, le revenu de solidarité active (RSA) ne serait désormais versé qu’aux personnes justifiant de 15 ans de séjour régulier sur le territoire et non plus cinq ans.

“Je ne suis pas le père Noël parce que les Guyanais ne sont pas des enfants”, avait prévenu jeudi Emmanuel Macron à Maripasoula. “Je suis ici avec de l‘ambition pour la Guyane mais je ne suis pas venu faire des promesses. Ce temps-là est fini, l‘Etat a fait trop de promesses qui n‘ont pas été tenues”.

“Je suis là pour (..) prendre des engagements que je saurai tenir durant mon quinquennat et assurer les éléments d‘autorité indispensables sur ce territoire”, avait-il dit.

D‘autres mesures seront également prises dans le cadre des “assises de l‘outre-mer”, promesse de campagne d‘Emmanuel Macron. Lancées début octobre, elles doivent déboucher sur un “livre bleu outre-mer” d’ici la fin du mois d’avril et être traduites - si nécessaire - dans la loi.","Guyane: Les promesses seront tenues sans céder aux pressions, affirme Macron",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1CW1P5-OFRTP
