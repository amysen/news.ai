Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.

Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”

The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.

Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.

The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a massive fraud scheme involving Russian officials.

In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors. “They protect themselves in this way,” he said.

A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment. Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.

How Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to Trump campaign, is a tangled tale. A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York. The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered. Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecution’s evidence.

While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russia’s top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.

Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.

In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaika’s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general’s office gave a memo detailing the charges — stamped “confidential”— to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.

Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas. She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.

The next month, Mr. Chaika’s office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor general’s website.

Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute. She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarov’s attorney, Scott Balber.

She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov’s son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.

In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor — an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika — had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian government’s effort to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and said a “government lawyer” would fly to New York to deliver the documents.

Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstone’s emails as “goosed-up.” Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting. “Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues,” he said.

Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign. “I love it,” he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.

Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier. Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was “not related at all to the fact” that Donald Trump Jr. “was the son of the candidate.” But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.

Last week, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: “Of course they don’t like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, ‘Guys, what is happening with you at home? Who is in charge of your politics? Who is paying these politicians, and for what?’”

In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used “Russian money” to lobby for the sanctions law.

Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin. But a number of well-known Russian analysts called it inconceivable that Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.

I tiptoed through upside-down rooms and kitchens with rumbling floors, past sinks running with blood and candles sliding along mantels, and declined housekeeping from an undead maid.

Horseman’s Hollow

(Ages 10 and up, Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.)

Photo

At 7 p.m. that same Saturday, the line for Horseman’s Hollow was full, and devil horns ($3.95 at the gift shop) glowed red on many a head. Ghosts in tricorn hats chased shrieking SUNY students. A local market sold doughnuts and cider. Inspired by “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” Historic Hudson Valley staged Horseman’s Hollow on the grounds of Philipsburg Manor, converting the historical site into a colonial town gone mad. Think fewer clowns, more yellow fever.

I followed a lantern-lit trail along the Pocantico River toward the old manor. Signs along the path warned of the Headless Horseman, but mostly it was just nice to be out of the city.

Decapitations were, fittingly, all the rage in the town. “Let’s see how you laugh without a windpipe,” one lobbed-off head barked through planks of wood.

“Welcome to my garden,” a crone beckoned, and I proceeded cautiously, worried she’d push a farm share.

In a dark barn, ghosts in flowing, glowing sheers oscillated like tower fans. A zombie nun stopped eating a dead soldier’s entrails to scream at me, then the dead soldier popped up to scream as well.

“Oh, God,” I whimpered as I stepped into a foreboding temple.

“You’re right,” a satanic figure atop the throne said. “I am God.”

Winding outdoor paths provided a moment to catch my breath before the next hazy tent or demon’s Airbnb. I paused in the cemetery to let pass a woman who had been loudly telling her friend an unrelated childhood story since we’d left the fortune teller’s camp — what is this, the Moth? Pipe down!

Outside the schoolhouse, Ichabod Crane jumped out. “He’s real!” he cried, pointing.

Looming up ahead, in front of the manor, the Horseman sat ominously on a real horse. “No flash!” a handler snapped at the people in the crowd who had their phones out like Justin Bieber was on that horse and we were all in Montclair, N.J.

Back at the entrance, the ghouls entertained the crowd with a Mad-Libbed shanty, incorporating someone’s oh-so-Hudson-River-Valley suggestion: “401(k).”

Blood Manor

(Ages 14 and up, Hudson Square, Manhattan)

At 11 p.m., the line for Blood Manor stretched down Varick Street. Now in its 13th season, this Manhattan haunt caters to an older, clubgoing set — no doughnuts, no cider. Speakers blasted Cardi B while a stilted man carrying a scythe stalked the line and posed with people in front of a step-and-repeat backdrop.

Inside, it was loud and hot. For 20 feverish minutes, throughout 18 different rooms, I fended off attacks from an ax-wielding contortionist, an undead stripper dancing across from, well, a dead stripper impaled on her pole, and a doctor who leapt across his operating table toward me, growling, “It’s just you and me, big guy.”

This Is Real

(Ages 18 and up, Red Hook, Brooklyn)

Ever wondered what you’d do if you were kidnapped? I sure haven’t.

From Psycho Clan, the team behind Nightmare New York, This Is Real simulates a group abduction in an isolated Red Hook warehouse. Only eight people are admitted during each time slot, and everyone must sign a waiver beforehand. Because most of the other times were sold out, I was given a 3 p.m. Sunday slot, a good option in case you and your aunt can’t get into “Hello, Dolly!”

I stood outside the warehouse with my fellow abductees: a group of male friends and a guy who’d driven two hours from Connecticut. Threatening greeters circled us, murmuring, “Introduce yourselves. You will need each other.”

Two of my biggest fears were already being engaged: a broken fourth wall and a bunch of straight guys depending on me for their survival.

Inside we were blindfolded, bound at the hands and led one by one into narrow cells. I wriggled free of my bindings and raised my blindfold just in time to watch the stocking-capped killer spray a tied-up woman with a gas that made her woozy. He ran down our row of cells, spraying us as well.

“You’re pretty,” he said to my neighbor, and, to me, “I’m attracted to you.”

Photo

“Thank you,” I nearly purred back.

He hauled the woman out, and we had to unlock our cells and scour the filthy, sparse room for ways to escape without getting caught. Every few minutes we heard whistling, which meant the killer was approaching, and scrambled to hide. I wasn’t fast enough the first time.

“Dead!” he shouted, pointing at me, as earsplitting horror movie strings swelled. (Luckily, you get three lives.)

The boys tore through our room while I tried to look busy. “Here,” one of them said to me, “I’ll hoist you up to that electrical box, and see if you can find anything.” I longed for the killer’s whistle.

I survived the 70-minute ordeal, hiding in a refrigerator two rooms back, abandoned by the others. The greeters, no longer threatening, took our photo for the Instagram page and recommended Botanica across the street for a drink.

“It’s not much cooler out there,” a greeter said, pushing the warehouse doors open.

Oh, right — out there. I took a deep breath, steeled myself and stepped back in.

Heavy Hitters Away From the Canvas

‘Drawn to Greatness: Master Drawings From the Thaw Collection,’ at the Morgan Library & Museum

This major group drawing show, running through Jan. 7, constitutes a grand summing-up of a career, of an art form and of an institution’s holdings. During the past 60 years, the New York art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare Eddy Thaw, amassed a phenomenal drawing collection notable for its chronological breadth, running from the early Renaissance to the near present. This year they gave more than 400 items outright to the Morgan, expanding and deepening its range. The 150 works on view include a super-rare Andrea Mantegna, an unearthly Samuel Palmer and a soulful Vincent Van Gogh. HOLLAND COTTER

Carnegie Hall often hands its “Perspectives” series, in which stars conceive programs over a season, to artists at their peak, so it’s good to see the management entrust Mr. Trifonov, at the ripe old age of 26, with a few evenings to explore his considerable musical imagination. The program at8 p.m. on Saturday echoes his new recording with homages to Chopin — represented by the Piano Sonata No. 2 — by Mompou, Schumann, Grieg, Barber, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff.

‘Boo at the Zoo’ at the Bronx, Queens and Prospect Park Zoos

Halloween promises a wild time, and few places do that better than those where wild creatures reside. Each year these zoos host weekend celebrations that educate about animals as well as entertain young humans. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Bronx Zoo offers a Haunted Forest, with both wildlife models and scary apparitions,and the Extinct Species Graveyard, a fake cemetery devoted to a real threat: vanishing creatures. Other attractions include presentations of live birds associated with Halloween, like owls, ravens and vultures, anda costume parade with stilt walkers from Alice Farley Dance Theater , above. The Queens Zoo ’s festivities, also 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., include holiday treats for wildlife — meat-stuffed pumpkins, for example — and a haunted trail for people. The Prospect Park Zoo , whose “Boo” runs 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a Spooky Barn, is focusing on bats, whose activities are more helpful than horrifying. And who could resist a dance party alongside sea lions, which are pretty inventive movers themselves? LAUREL GRAEBER

Amazon showed on Thursday how it continues to play by rules that cause fits of despair among conventional retailers. For a company its size and age, it reports meager profits, choosing to plow the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.

Amazon said its net income for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 was $256 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $252 million, also 52 cents a share, during the same period last year.

But Amazon also gave investors the numbers they love to see, a 34 percent jump to $43.7 billion in revenue, as it continued to nibble away at the pocketbooks of customers. The company’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, jumped 30 percent to $4.58 billion in revenue, which Wall Street loves because it accounts for most of what little profit the company reports.

Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Markets has sparked concerns from rivals that the company could become a terrifying new force in the huge category of grocery retailing. During the quarter, Amazon said, Whole Foods added $1.3 billion to its overall revenue.

The most remarkable sign of Amazon’s growth may be its rise in head count, most of which occurs in its warehouses. At the end of September, Amazon had 541,900 employees, up 77 percent from a year earlier.

The average earnings estimate compiled from analysts by Thomson Reuters was 3 cents a share, and the average revenue estimate was $42.14 billion.

On a conference call with financial analysts, Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, were not asked about Google’s pending appearance before Congress.

Unlike Amazon, Alphabet gushed profits. Alphabet reported net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share — surpassing Wall Street’s earnings forecasts by more than a dollar. The company is bringing in more revenue — up 24 percent — while squeezing more profit from every dollar it brings in.

In July, when Alphabet previously reported quarterly results, investors shrugged off a $2.7 billion fine from the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm. The fine temporarily hit the company’s bottom line but did little to slow revenue growth or demand for its advertising.

Alphabet accounts for about 32 percent of all global digital advertising spending, according to research firm eMarketer. When it is combined with Facebook, the pair account for roughly half of all internet ad spending in the world.

With earnings showing no signs of slowing, Alphabet continues to amass a cash war chest. The company’s stockpile of cash and marketable securities topped $100 billion — or roughly the market value of Goldman Sachs.

Microsoft is mentioned less frequently as a potential target for regulators, in part because it already went through an agonizing antitrust saga in the 1990s and 2000s, one that hobbled it when big shifts in technology were looming.

But in the past several years, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has revived the company, in part by redoubling its focus on cloud computing, where it has emerged as a credible No. 2 competitor to Amazon.

While Microsoft is not the fearsome leviathan it once was, it is still a moneymaking machine. On Thursday, the Redmond, Wash., company reported net income of $6.58 billion, or 85 cents a share, up from $5.67 billion, or 73 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue was up 12 percent to $24.54 billion.

The average earnings estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters was 72 cents a share, with revenue of $23.56 billion. Its shares jumped 3 percent.

Microsoft executives credited much of the company’s success in the quarter to growth in its cloud computing business, which encompasses everything from online storage to internet-based versions of Microsoft’s Office applications that customers subscribe to rather than purchase.

The company said its commercial cloud business had brought in $5 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from the previous year.

They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case.
In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota.
Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students.","And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.

Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group.

The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was “time to pause” on the issue.

The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.

Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.

Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers’ union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son’s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.

“I was willing to do everything and anything,” Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.

The mothers’ resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons’ accusers had felt hurt.

Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.

One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.

“In my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,” Judith said. “It was considered, ‘I was stupid and I got embarrassed.’”

Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, “preponderance of the evidence,” in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.

The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. “We recognized that power,” Ms. Seefeld said.

Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.

A number of women’s groups and victims’ advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as “rape deniers” and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.

Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson.

“It is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,” Ms. Davidson said.

But, she said of the mothers, “I think it’s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.”

Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons’ names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.

Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.

Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.

“I think I have a problem,” her son said. “It’s bad.”

She felt a flash of irritation.

“How many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,” she said she told him.

Then the gravity of the situation sank in. “I need to hire a lawyer,” she thought.

A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.

As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son’s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it “as if it were the grocery list,” she recalled.

Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.

According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.

Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.

Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online.

Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. “It was very solemn,” Alison said. “It was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.”

Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.

She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were “super respectful” of women, she said.

“We don’t really need to teach our sons not to rape,” she said.

Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a “double life,” unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.

Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students — to a point.

“Any mother is watching out for the children, that’s what mothers do,” Ms. Davidson said. “But I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.”

Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.

His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.

Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son’s case, she said. “Within 30 minutes I heard from the president,” she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.

A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser’s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)

Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will?

“I just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,” she said of her son’s punishment. “And pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.”","‘Willing to Do Everything,’ Mothers Defend Sons Accused of Sexual Assault",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/campus-sex-assault-mothers.html

Some Republicans are already pointing to the recent expansion as proof that tax cuts could push the growth rate above 3 percent for years to come — and that just the prospect of that happening is already having an effect.

Mr. Trump made economic growth a political flash point during his campaign and has continued to do so since taking office, promising to reach heights that eluded his predecessor.

“On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent,” Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August. Touting a strong quarter in the spring, when growth hit 3.1 percent, the president suggested that “we’re really on our way” to sustaining that speed year-round.

The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, but economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.

The figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their tax policy: They are celebrating faster growth while claiming tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that the Commerce Department data “reinforces the resilience of the American people.” Republicans, he added, “will deliver on our tax reform promise this year — ushering in a new era of growth.”

Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday that companies were investing more, and driving growth higher, in expectation of a tax cut. Failing to pass a tax bill, he said, would cause growth to slump and markets to tumble.

“If you look at the G.D.P. data, it’s clear that is a major reason why capital spending has increased,” he said, referring to expectations of a tax cut. “If those expectations appear to be incorrect, I would expect capital spending to go back into decline.”

For now, economists are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy’s trajectory.

“There hasn’t been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to that’s fueling the acceleration,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it’s the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.

Ms. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February, has pursued gradual increases of the Fed’s benchmark interest rate in an effort to steer the economy toward steady growth without overheating. The Fed is expected to raise rates when it meets in December. Mr. Trump is publicly weighing whether to replace Ms. Yellen, considering two possible successors, but has also signaled that he may decide to renominate her.

“Markets would probably applaud her reappointment,” Mr. Anderson said.

Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust rate of 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were “a sign that consumers are hanging tough.”

At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased.

Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. Businesses may be investing in computers and industrial equipment in response to a tight labor market and rising wages, economists said.

“Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,” Mr. Anderson said.

Hurricanes can disrupt an economy in obvious ways — ruining homes, incapacitating infrastructure, and slowing the flow of goods across the country. The Houston metropolitan area is the country’s fifth largest, accounting for 3 percent of national economic output, and the severe flooding brought on by Hurricane Harvey had an immediate impact on employment. The country’s economy shed 33,000 jobs in September, the first monthly drop in seven years.

But after the negative shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.

“If you don’t go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.”

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left 600,000 to one million vehicles needing replacement, according to Cox Automotive, and Americans rushed to dealerships to recoup what they had lost. Car sales spiked in September, reaching their highest level since 2005.

The growth figure released on Friday was the government’s first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. It can be hard to accurately measure the full effect of a natural disaster immediately after it occurs, and so these numbers could swing up or down when the department revisits the period.

Chasing Growth The United States has been a pace setter among developed economies, but Europe is no longer a laggard. Annual rate of change in G.D.P. + 4 % U.S. + 2 Japan 0 European Union – 2 – 4 – 6 ’05 ’10 ’15 ’16

The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.

“This is happening globally,” Mr. Zandi, the Moody’s economist, said. “There isn’t a single major economy that is in recession.”

A weak dollar has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for Finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex. a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international.

“Things are picking up — I sense it in Europe,” Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filters down to rural communities. “Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,” he said.","U.S. Economy Grew at 3% Rate in 3rd Quarter, Despite Storms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/economy/economy-quarter-gdp.html

(Hitting a baseball is hard enough; imagine bashing it into the stands when it is thrown at 97 miles per hour and you have barely played the past two weeks.)

Even when standout Dodgers relievers Brandon Morrow and Kenley Jansen gave up a run in the eighth inning, the Dodgers still held a 3-2 lead, and I thought the 950 words of a story framed around Seager would still work. I even liked how I had written it.

But in the top of the ninth inning, something unlikely happened: Astros’ left fielder Marwin Gonzalez, who had been struggling in the playoffs, clobbered a game-tying home run off Jansen, who had never blown a save in his playoff career. It was 11:18 p.m. Eastern.

While the most dramatic, mind-bending games are fun to watch on the couch or at the bar or in the stands, trying to capture the many late-game twists and turns as the final print edition deadline nears can be nerve-wracking.

So, goodbye Corey Seager story. I copied it all into a separate document and started rewriting.

Then, in the top of the 10th inning, Astros stars Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa gave Houston a 5-3 lead with two solo home runs. As a reporter, I have no rooting interest. But this gave me a little bit of a cushion from deadline pressure: The Dodgers still had to bat in the bottom of the inning.

I reframed the story around the Houston’s improbable comeback against a Dodgers bullpen that had not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings entering the game, focusing on the blasts by Gonzalez, Correa and Altuve.

Mr. Weinstein’s social diagnosis successfully invoked the era that we had just memorialized after Hugh Hefner died. Mr. Hefner invented the Playboy ethos that Mr. Weinstein used like a get-out-of-jail-free card. “The culture then” encouraged men to loosen their libidos and women were expected to tolerate it. Playboy operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way — his. And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.

When Oliver Stone and Woody Allen came forward to express sympathy for Mr. Weinstein, everybody rolled their eyes at them, too. More defensive insult, and from men seemingly indifferent to an internet that swiftly dredged up trouble from their own sexual histories. That both directors felt a need to speak up illustrates an enduring, but misguided, myth of the sexual revolution. We romanticized Mr. Hefner’s empire as a revolutionary force — lovers gonna love, and all of that — but it was actually just a popularization of entitlement.

Photo

In the wake of the Weinstein news, as more women detail unwanted encounters with colleagues and bosses, we’re seeing how common it was for men, indeed, to help themselves. We’re seeing how the personal Playboy fantasy, benign as it might have looked, could spread into the workplace.

Mr. Hefner’s disdain for sexual limits fueled fantasies and shaped self-images. He was the Walt Disney of lust — and had his own set of seemingly innocuous iconic animal ears. You didn’t have to read Playboy, visit the mansion, wear pajamas or even be straight: The effects of its ideas about women on the American psyche were totalizing. Women were inferior to men because, for Playboy, they were scenery — pretty, passive, usually white, often blonde, there.

The Playboy doctrine would mutate into the darker, more explicit realm that is spooling out on “The Deuce.” Pornography gave us a framework for understanding sex as both an act and a state of mind that was similar to Hollywood’s imposition of ideas about romance.

The stories that get repeated in plot after plot have become a kind of erogenous pop-culture value system: women as prey, as parts (boobs, bottoms, lips, legs) as often as wholes; leading women but also the “final girl.” A search for full female humanity in Hollywood movies turns up a lot of dolls and dream girls.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The culture now seems eager to challenge some of those values — or at least to restage, unpack and reckon with, in Mr. Weinstein’s words, “the culture then.” The journalistic depiction of prostitution and a burgeoning porn cinema on “The Deuce” is grim and queasy and morally suspenseful. Not even the wiliest, most enterprising female characters fare well. But the show’s most exhilarating moments are on the faces of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dominique Fishback, as they come alive with plans of self-determination, of power-sharing. But it feels like it might take forever for their dreams to come true.

The other night I saw “Battle of the Sexes,” which recounts that time in 1974 when the former tennis champ and self-styled chauvinist clown Bobby Riggs baited Billie Jean King into playing a match that became a national political spectacle. It’s not a great movie. Things get logy anytime it goes near a hotel room. (Why don’t moviemakers know that hotel air isn’t quite the same as oxygen?)

But I went home happy, anyway. That’s because the movie takes a rollicking, triumphal approach to the feminism of its day. (It was also known as “women’s lib” back then.) The men sit around in locker rooms and lounges grinning and grunting and slurping beer. Howard Cosell says about Ms. King, “Should she ever let her hair grow down to her shoulders, took her glasses off, you’d have somebody vying for a Hollywood screen test.”

Photo

It’s true that no one is bragging about how easy it is to grab a woman by her vagina. And Riggs, courtesy of Steve Carell, is a cartoon: loud, bawdy, shameless, mildly pathetic, opportunistically insincere, a little desperate, a jester in misogynist drag. He’s like the villain in an episode of “Scooby Doo” before Scooby and the gang yank off his mask. I would’ve gotten away with it, if it weren’t for you meddling feminists!

And yet the old Riggs’s chauvinism is still out there. Earlier this month, Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers’ quarterback was asked by a sports reporter, Jourdan Rodrigue, a standard professional question about his receivers and their routes. He didn’t notice her professionalism. He noticed something else: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes.” (The lassitude in his response acquires some lasciviousness for that last word.)

This is to say that the Playboy-era myths are hard to shake. “Battle of the Sexes” and “The Deuce,” especially, show how resistant we are to real equality. One dead pimp on “The Deuce” doesn’t end male-controlled prostitution. Systemic inequity is harder to kill. So is the misogyny that fuels it.

The disentanglement of Harvey Weinstein from Hollywood’s institutions has, so far, culminated in the termination of his membership in the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit whose duties include handing out the Oscars. His eviction might address an aspect of the Harvey Weinstein problem. But it doesn’t do much to reverse the absence of women from all kinds of craft jobs; nor does it end the drought of best picture winners that feature two or more women in major speaking roles who also speak to each other. In the last 34 years, that’s happened twice, with “Terms of Endearment” and “Chicago.” We’re talking about a phallocentrism that’s baked into movies and television. It’s the reason we have the Bechdel Test, which asks whether female characters, among other very simple things, meaningfully communicate with each other about something other than a man. Almost no movies pass.

There’s power in turning to the past to illuminate the current state of things. But there’s different power in the culture now looking at the culture now — or now-ish. The second-season dismount of the Amazon show “One Mississippi” involves a woman’s reaction to an important, sexually creepy male producer. A sensationally complex episode of “Girls” from February — “American Bitch” — puts its protagonist, Hannah Horvath, inside the apartment and on the bed of a famous writer and notorious harasser whom she had visited in order to confront. The best thing about the HBO show “Westworld” is the struggle of female androids to extricate themselves from the limiting fantasies for which they’ve been created. And a major Emmy winner this year was HBO’s “Big Little Lies,” in which a group of frenemies wind up training their focus on an abusive husband. Another was “The Handmaid’s Tale,” on Hulu, about life for women under patriarchal totalitarianism. An idea associated with that show was the same as a hashtag that showed up during the women’s march in January: Resist.

Before this month, I had heard Beyoncé’s “Formation” as a song about, more or less, united, self-protective black feminism. But since the Weinstein news, the chorus sounds more than ever as if it could double as a gender-wide war command: “O.K., ladies now let’s get in formation” — or “let’s get information.” Either way, now I can hear a call for action and solidarity, to be seen and believed.

Still, the persistence of all this combat can leave you weary. That accounts for the mixed emotions of my night at “Battle of the Sexes.” This is a movie about a tennis match that really happened, yet it feels like a fable. When Billie Jean King, who’s played by Emma Stone, wins the first set, cheers broke out in the theater. Actual cheers. I turned around to see who clapped, and one section was filled with women who seemed old enough to remember seeing the match. Celebrating it felt good; it felt just.

It also felt dismayingly recurrent. The movie is called “Battle of the Sexes” but only because somebody already took “Groundhog Day.” And Ms. King is very much a civil rights legend. But, here, she’s also Sisyphus.

So what now? If the entitlements of the Playboy era have suffused our lunch breaks and boardroom meetings and subway rides home, and porn has evolved into something elemental, like fire and water, how do we prevent their personal encroachments and abuses, along with every other important but less salacious imbalance, like for instance, with salaries? How do we reconcile all the complications? “Resist” is one thing. “Change” is something else. Beyoncé is sending that solidarity cry out for ladies. But to get anything meaningful done, more than a few good men are going to have to answer it, too.","Weinstein, Hefner and the Poor Excuse That Explains a Lot",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/weinstein-hefner-and-the-poor-excuse-that-explains-a-lot.html

So we tested Google’s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.
Setting Up Advanced ProtectionAnyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Google’s Advanced Protection webpage.
Google’s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.
When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google’s keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: “No comment.”","The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you. Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.

After the attack, Google’s security team came up with a motto: “Never again.” The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers’ Gmail accounts. It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.

Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked. Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.

The idea of Google’s Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message. Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.

But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group? Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.

So we tested Google’s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses. The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys. But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.

Setting Up Advanced Protection

Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Google’s Advanced Protection webpage. To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each. Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.

The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you. To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it. (The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.) This process takes a few minutes.

On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins. That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.

But there are trade-offs. Google’s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys. For the time being, that means only Google’s Gmail mail app, Google’s Backup and Sync app, and Google’s Chrome browser.

On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Google’s Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser. So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you’re out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.

Testing the Security

Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.

Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.

On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don’t have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.

Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google’s requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.

But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.

Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google’s program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.

“It’s something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,” Ms. Sandvik said. “I don’t see a reason you shouldn’t turn this on.”

The Bottom Line

While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.

It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google’s apps from Apple’s and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google’s mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature — Apple’s V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google’s iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.

Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won’t work with the keys.

If using Google’s security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online. Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Google’s lead.

If you decide to wait, don’t procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages. While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.

The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well.

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.

During the debate that preceded their vote, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as “historic” and “happy,” or else “tragic” and a violation of Spain’s Constitution, perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.

Within an hour of the Catalan vote, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution, granting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy extraordinary powers to take direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, who may now be subject to charges of rebellion.

In a speech on Friday before the vote, Mr. Rajoy had said he had “no alternative” because Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist government had pursued an illegal and unilateral path that was “contrary to the normal behavior in any democratic country like ours.”

Undeterred by the government’s threat, and after a bitter debate, separatists in the Catalan Parliament passed a resolution to create “a Catalan republic as an independent state.” Most of the lawmakers opposed to independence walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote.

Since the region’s referendum on Oct. 1, Mr. Puigdemont had been squeezed in a tightening vice of his own creation, and seemed at times to contradict his own declarations as he squirmed for a way out.

On the one hand, the inexperienced, former small city mayor was trapped between demands from Catalan hard-liners to declare independence, and on the other by a stiffening response from a Rajoy government determined to preserve the nation’s constitution and territorial integrity.

Despite pleas for mediation, he and his region’s independence bid were shunned and condemned, not only by the Madrid central government but also European Union officials wary of encouraging similarly minded secessionist movements around the Continent.

European leaders made clear on Friday that they would not be recognizing Catalan independence and would support Mr. Rajoy, as leader of one of the bloc’s most important member states. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a Twitter post that “nothing changes” and “Spain remains our only interlocutor.”

Searching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections — which Mr. Rajoy has said he, too, wouldnow call within six months — in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia’s autonomy.

But Madrid would offer no guarantee that it would not clamp down on the region, Mr. Puigdemont said, as he immediately faced a revolt in his own ranks from secessionist die-hards who called him a traitor.

After hours of wavering on Thursday, he relented and threw the decision on independence to Catalan lawmakers, who took the fateful plunge on Friday.

Addressing the Catalan Parliament in Spanish, Carlos Carrizosa, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos, a party that opposes secession, told Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers that, far from creating a new Catalan republic, “you will go down in history for having fractured Catalonia and for sinking the institutions of Catalonia.”

In front of the assembly, he tore apart a copy of the independence resolution. “Your job is not to promise unrealizable dreams but to improve the daily lives of people,” he said.

Before the independence vote, Marta Rovira, a separatist lawmaker, told the assembly that “today we start on a new path” to build “a better country.” She added: “We are creating a country free of repression.”

Catalan lawmakers who voted for independence could face prosecution for sedition, or even rebellion.

Marta Ribas, a Catalan lawmaker, said that Madrid’s use of Article 155 was unjustified, but also argued that “it’s a mistake to respond to one outrageous act with another outrageous act.”

She added: “A declaration of independence won’t protect us from the 155, quite the contrary.”

In the streets outside Parliament in Barcelona, not far from a boisterous pro-independence rally, a few Catalans quietly expressed similar frustrations.

The Oct. 1 referendum did not give the Catalan government the legitimacy to vote to secede, said Federico Escolar, 53, a cafe owner.

“Most of the people who would have voted no did not participate,” Mr. Escolar said, while smoking a cigarette outside his cafe. “It was not a proper referendum. It was illegal.”

Walking into a nearby subway station, Christina Juana, a 38-year-old social worker, agreed.

“Neither Puigdemont nor the Catalan government knows exactly what the Catalan people’s opinion is,” Ms. Juana said.

Before the Catalan Parliament’s vote for independence on Friday, large crowds had gathered outside in anticipation of what they hoped would be a historic day for Catalonia.

Many were draped in flags as they watched the parliamentary debate on two large screens, cheering during speeches by pro-independence lawmakers and hissing those of their opponents. When proceedings hit a lull, the crowds cycled through a series of pro-independence chants.

“Spanish occupiers!” was one, a reference to the national police officers who tried to stop the Oct. 1 referendum by force. “Leave Catalonia!”

“I feel very, very happy,” said Emili Ara, a 79-year-old retired realtor, who said he had hoped for Catalan independence for most of his life, even in the days when the concept had little widespread appeal.

“The people living here, both those who voted yes and those who voted no, will be able to see their sons and grandsons enjoy a much better future,” he added.

The optimism of Mr. Ara and his family was not dented by the prospect of the Spanish government’s moving to take over administration of the region.

“We have to declare independence even if we end up with less autonomy than we have now,” said Eulalia Ara, Mr. Ara’s 39-year-old daughter. “We can’t continue in this situation because we are being repressed by the Spanish state.”

And even “if they steal our Parliament and our government,” said Jordi Ara, Mr. Ara’s 18-year-old grandson, “we will still have our beliefs!”

Elsewhere in the crowd, separatist protesters saw little problem with declaring independence even though less than 43 percent of voters had participated in the referendum.

“Two months ago, I would have said that 43 percent was not enough,” said Ester Romero, 25, a sales manager who had come to the rally after picking up her degree certificate.

First, lawmakers can give states greater flexibility on the scope of health benefits that plans must provide. The law now requires that state waivers establish plans to provide coverage that is as “comprehensive” as that provided for under the law’s essential health benefits requirement. But some states may wish to mandate coverage of a different set of benefits than that specified, or choose to minimize the benefits that plans are required to cover. It is unclear, at best, whether this would be permissible under current law. Congress could either clarify what is meant by “comprehensive” in Section 1332 or, more helpfully, simply specify that states have greater flexibility in determining the benefits that must be covered.

These changes would not permit states to eliminate the A.C.A.’s protections for those with pre-existing health conditions nor allow them to introduce differential pricing for health plans based on health status.

Second, Congress can make it easier for states to put their own reform plans into effect and narrow the discretion given to the administration to approve or deny waiver applications. Lawmakers could do this by deeming waiver applications presumptively valid, so long as they certify that a similar number of people will be covered and at a comparable level of affordability as under the law and that the state reforms will not increase the federal deficit. This would apply regardless of whether an application comes from a progressive or conservative state. Vermont, for example, considered a Section 1332 waiver to install a single-payer health system but stopped because it could not come up with a funding mechanism to support the plan.

Federal authorities would then be responsible for evaluation of the state’s reform plan as soon as six months after the waiver is approved and on an as-needed basis thereafter. States not meeting thresholds of affordability or the number of people covered would then be required to adjust their reforms accordingly.

We are on the cusp of a rare health care bipartisan agreement. Still, conservatives will (and should) insist on fundamental reforms to Obamacare as part of the deal. In so doing, they should aim for an approach that will truly give more states the opportunity to become what Justice Louis Brandeis once called the “laboratories of democracy.”",How Republicans Can Make a Deal on Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/how-republicans-can-make-a-deal-on-health-care.html

Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers. The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit. His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality. Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel. Is the baby whom one of Christian’s colleagues brings into the room really his child? Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world? What about Christian’s own daughters?

The marble sculpture “Man and His Thought,” another item from the Alte Nationalgalerie’s permanent collection, shows a man breathing life into an androgynous figure.

Catherine Chevillot, director of the Musée Rodin, explained that the moment of inspiration is inextricably linked to the act of creation in the sculptor’s figures. “Rodin is permanently haunted by the question of what constitutes art,” she said by phone from Paris. “The idea that the artist has to decide at the moment that a creation arises — also that life arises — is key to understanding his work.”

Ms. Chevillot noted the particularly spontaneous nature of “The Hero,” in which the female muse emerges like “smoke or waves from the male figure, a continuity of form which mocks his realism.”

“Whether or not she has a head is of no importance to him,” she said of Rodin. “What is important is the deep expression of the composition as a whole.”

In the poem “Nike” — the exhibit will display the original manuscript, on loan from the Swiss National Library in Bern — Rilke tried not to respond directly to the sculpture but to create a work of art in its own right. In a 1920 letter to his patroness Nanny Wunderly-Volkart, he even tried to obscure the connection.

“It is never about translating a painting or a sculpture” into words, the Rilke scholar Torsten Hoffmann said by phone from Frankfurt. “He finds that boring. He is interested in what a painting or sculpture can do for him as a poet and human being.”

“Nike” emerged after a period from 1916 to 1919 that Rilke described as “the most hopeless years” of his life. By 1922, Rilke had finished his most famous works, the “Duineser Elegien” and “Sonnets to Orpheus,” both of which were published in 1923. Mr. Hoffmann said, however, that it would be inaccurate to credit Rodin’s “Hero” with a phase of renewed creativity.

“Rilke senses his own condition in the sculpture, with this angel, genius or muse,” Mr. Hoffmann said, citing “the decisive turning point” for the poet as the end of World War I and his return to Paris. But Rilke’s first encounter with Rodin in the early 20th century had a direct effect on his aesthetic. The “New Poems” of 1907 and 1908 stand as a case in point.

“Rilke tries to create a very clear form — with 14 lines, 14 verses — something similar to a sculpture,” Mr. Hoffmann said. “Just as Rodin creates things with his hands, Rilke takes up external subjects at this time. In previous work, he is more introspective.”

Rilke not only handled the sale of Rodin’s work in the German-speaking world as his personal secretary from 1905 to 1906, but also defended him against conservative criticism in a 1907 lecture delivered in cities including Dresden and Bremen. A series of watercolors in particular had caused a scandal in Germany for their graphic nudity.

As early as 1896, the Alte Nationalgalerie acquired its first Rodin works. Its director at the time, Hugo von Tschudi, also became the first to purchase a Manet painting (“In the Winter Garden”) for a museum. “Rodin-Rilke-Hofmannsthal” will be set up among French Impressionist works as a kind of “exhibit within an exhibit,” said Mr. Gleis, paying homage to the farsighted vision of Mr. Tschudi and previous directors.

He acknowledged the challenge of contributing to the dialogue about Rodin after a glut of centenary events but said he hoped that the exhibit’s interdisciplinary approach would raise questions not just about art, but also about literary history.

The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)

After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.

His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.

Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.

Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.

When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.

She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.

Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?

And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.

All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.

Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.

Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”

Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.

There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.

Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.

There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.

“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”",A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/your-money/paying-for-college/payback-college-loans.html

Richard Flory, the senior director of research at the University of Southern California’s Center for Religion and Civic Culture, said that evangelicals have a long history of hitching their Christianity to famous people as a way of drawing in congregants and making believers feel validated. Billy Graham had ties to Ronald Reagan, while the athlete Tim Tebow, the former action movie star Chuck Norris and the actor Kirk Cameron, have all been visible about their faith.

“That kind of celebrity culture weaves through evangelicalism really from the early 20th century,” Mr. Flory said. “‘Here’s this enormously successful person, and they believe like I do.’”

But some have criticized Hillsong as too enamored of celebrity, a complaint Mr. Lentz appears eager to pre-empt in the “Disclaimers” section at the beginning of the book, where he says he hopes to harness the star power for “something redemptive and meaningful.” Indeed, Hillsong has plenty of critics on either side of the aisle. There are those on the left who regard it as insufficiently open-minded on social issues, and those on the right who describe the church’s theology as “thin” and say it strays too far from Christian orthodoxy.

“There isn’t a great deal of historical Christianity or explicit theological content in their worship,” said R. Albert Mohler Jr., the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. “I think there is a determined effort on the part of these churches,” he continued, referring to Hillsong and others, “to avoid dealing with hard theological questions that might offend people.”

Critics notwithstanding, the church has been growing fast. Mr. Lentz said it has 9,000 or 10,000 congregants in its 7-year-old New York City congregation and about 100,000 worldwide. It also draws a lot of young people and a fair amount of racial diversity, which many American churches struggle to do.

Observers say that Hillsong has stayed largely on the periphery of charged social battles, walking a delicate line as evangelicals running churches in liberal American cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Church leaders appear to have tried to create a welcoming environment for gay people, for example, without actually coming out in support of gay marriage. But Mr. Lentz has spoken out on issues of race in the past, and he devotes a chapter to it in his book called “If You’re Racist and You Know It, Clap Your Hands.” Mr. Lentz said that Opal Tometi, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, was a part of his church for several years.

“Racially speaking, are things better?” he writes. “Yes. But that statement is like saying, ‘If you have been shot 10 times before and recently have only been stabbed five times, are you in better shape?’ The issue is constant attack, not different types of pain.”

Sitting backstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom preparing to give his sermon, Mr. Lentz said that while he long planned to write a book, and hopes that this is the first of many, this felt like an important moment to join the public conversation.

""There’s some stuff that’s really basic to me that I feel is in jeopardy right now, like decency, awareness, humanity. Stuff that shouldn’t be complicated is complicated,” he said. “I feel like the national climate has made it more urgent.”

Bad news, bears. Hibernation is no longer the coolest thing animals do to survive the winter.

As cold weather approaches, tiny mole-like creatures known as red-toothed shrews will shrink their own heads, reducing their skull and brain mass by as much as 20 percent, according to new research published Monday in Current Biology. When warm weather returns, they will regrow the region nearly to its original size, giving new meaning to the phrase “spring ahead.”

Though it is not yet clear why the shrews go down a few sizes for the winter, the authors of the study speculate that the reduced head and brain size helps them conserve energy when resources are scarce.

“These tiny mammals cannot migrate long distances to avoid winter, nor can they enter any kind of energy-saving state” like hibernation, said Javier Lazaro, a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and an author of the study. They also have high metabolic rates and very little fat stored in their bodies. “Therefore, they starve within a few hours if they do not hunt constantly.”

The researchers say the shrinkage is a survival strategy.

“Brain tissue is energetically very expensive, so reducing overall brain size might decrease energy demands and thus food requirements,” he said.

“When you still have a government in power, we’re seeing how difficult it can be to conduct an investigation,” she added. “Where the court is interested in a rebel group or a group that’s not in power, it’s a different story. But power fights back against justice. That’s the bottom line, and that’s not unique to Africa.”

Burundi might still end up in the court’s sights, however. Under its founding charter, known as the Rome Statute, crimes in nonmember states can still be referred for investigation by the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations’ commission of inquiry on Burundi recommended such a referral.

According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.","These reporters are skilled experts feeling the strains of a crippled industry, and many are looking for a way out. Mather knows it.

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “Advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — I like to think of myself as a “word person” — someone who knows and loves words — but every once in a while, that perception gets jolted. As in most areas of life, we soon learn that no matter how smart we think we are, there are always those who are smarter. There are word people and then there are people who really, really know their words.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Once again, we have a lesson in paying attention and reading clues or any notes associated with the puzzle carefully. There’s got to be a reason the Across clues are so ... terse.

You did see the note, right? It says “The one-word Across clues all have an unusual relationship with their answers.” No kidding. That unusual relationship is for you to deduce, and when you do, prepare for a fun “Aha!” moment.

Today’s puzzle isn’t all that difficult once you get the hang of the theme, and the crossings are relatively gentle. If you’ve been looking forward to training your brain to think of alternate meanings in clues, this one by Alex Eaton-Salners might be just the Thursday puzzle for you.

Today’s Theme

It took me a while to get the hang of this one, but once I did, the rest of the puzzle fell quickly.

The Across clues in Mr. Eaton-Salners’s puzzle are all homophones, one of two or more words pronounced alike but different in meaning or derivation or spelling. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out which homophone of the Across clue (if there is more than one) is really the clue to be solved, and then you solve it.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — We’re doing some heavy lifting today, so make sure you do some warm-ups. John Guzzetta and Michael Hawkins are back and are asking us to help them move.

Today’s Theme

What we are moving are the Ys at the end of the first word of each of the theme entries, like the original phrase GRAVY TRAIN at 23A. The Ys (or their sound) move to the end of the second word of each theme phrase and are then pluralized to make an entirely different phrase, which is clued in a punny way. That changes the phrase to GRAVE TRAINEES, clued as “Interns at a cemetery?”

Please remember to lift with your knees and set the Ys down gently.

Similarly, the phrase JUICY PARTS (15D) is changed to JUICE PARTIES, which are “Social gatherings where fruit drinks are served?”

Mr. Hill raced toward the vehicle — the heroic agent in now-iconic images from that day, climbing aboard Kennedy’s car.

Mr. Hill did not hear the second shot as he hustled to the first family. He heard, and felt, the third. Then he draped his body over the Kennedys. If a fourth shot came, Mr. Hill resolved, it would hit him instead.

“I wish I had been quicker,” he said Thursday.

Making the Washington rounds on the occasion of the documents’ release — somberly greeting well-wishers, signing photographs of his act, demurring at any suggestion of his bravery — Mr. Hill spent his Thursday in search of something more complicated than closure, less tidy than simple vindication.

For decades, Mr. Hill has hoped for clarity on certain questions: Why did Lee Harvey Oswald do it? What was known about his activities in the months before the shooting?

Mr. Hill has not wondered who, precisely, was responsible for the violence of Nov. 22. It was one man, he said — a single gunman, three shots. He believes he is right not because he guessed right, not because he obsessed over it remotely, but because he was there, a fact that has informed every day of his life since.

There has been deep depression, unshakable self-interrogation, a nasty drinking habit.

It was Mr. Hill who could see the hole in the president’s skull that day; Mr. Hill who supplied the instant prognosis, turning to flash his colleagues a frantic thumbs-down; Mr. Hill who informed Robert F. Kennedy by phone, “It’s as bad as it can get.”

The president’s brother hung up.

“You have to relive it all,” Mr. Hill said softly on Thursday, shifting slightly in his seat. “But I’ve been doing that for 54 years.”

Traversing the capital on Thursday, Mr. Hill leaned into the introspection, recounting a career spent serving Kennedy and four other presidents — Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

He wondered aloud why the current one had often floated a baseless theory connecting Oswald to the father of Senator Ted Cruz, a rival for the Republican presidential nomination last year.

“It’s damaging to the presidency, to the office,” Mr. Hill said of President Trump’s handiwork.

He held forth on Caroline Kennedy (“smart girl — I guess I should say ‘lady’ now”), Poland Spring water (“Eisenhower’s water! We used to carry that”) and Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime conspiracy monger and informal adviser to Mr. Trump, whose name was invoked on cable television before Mr. Hill was scheduled to appear on Thursday morning.

“Turn to your left,” he told a seatmate in the MSNBC waiting area, apparently willing to offer a candid assessment of Mr. Stone only if cameras could not decipher any eye contact. “Roger Stone. Ugh.”

For most of his life, Mr. Hill, a North Dakota native who now lives outside San Francisco, has been disinclined to discuss the assassination in public. An exception came in 1975, shortly after he left the Secret Service. During a “60 Minutes” interview with Mike Wallace, Mr. Hill said, he broke down when questions about Dallas caught him off guard.

The next several years were spent largely confined to his basement, he said, sequestered from loved ones and drinking heavily. In the early 1980s, a friend convinced him his choice was clear: Change or die. He cleaned up.

By 1990, while in Texas for a conference, Mr. Hill steeled himself to return for the first time to the site of the assassination. He ventured to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald aimed his rifle at the president, according to the Warren Commission.

“I checked everything,” Mr. Hill said. “Angles. What was the weather like that day? Where exactly was the shooter? Where were we? Everything. And I finally came away knowing that I had done everything I could.”

Guilt and shame persisted, he said, trailing him into old age. In 2009, a friend and former agent asked for his assistance on a book. Talking helped, Mr. Hill found. He decided to do more of it.

His own book followed, a tribute to the woman he protected, titled “Mrs. Kennedy and Me,” written with Lisa McCubbin. They have since written two more books about Mr. Hill’s career.

“Very cathartic,” he said.

By now, Mr. Hill said, the conspiracy theories are little bother, even if he doubts that the document disclosure will discourage them much. On one count, though, Mr. Hill has remained vigilant in defense of his president.

“One last thing,” the TMZ emissary shouted as Mr. Hill returned to his hotel. “Marilyn Monroe!”

Mr. Hill cut him off. “That’s a fallacy,” he said. “Never saw her. And I was there a lot.” He ended the interview, stepping toward the hotel entrance, then turning back to ensure he had dispatched the only cameraman.

It has prompted increasingly frustrated members of Congress to demand answers for how a shadowy mission in an austere region of Africa left four Americans and five Nigeriens dead, including the interpreter.

The questions — including the mission’s shifting goals, the intelligence assessment to back it up, how the soldiers were separated and the frantic search for Sergeant Johnson’s body — were at the forefront on Thursday when senior military officers and their civilian Pentagon bosses traveled to Capitol Hill to give separate two-hour classified briefings for members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who heads the Senate panel and who has criticized the Defense Department for failing to provide lawmakers details of the ambush, praised the briefing without divulging details. But he emphasized that he still had “100 questions” that the officials could not yet answer.

Pentagon officials said they would need 30 days to wrap up their inquiry, Mr. McCain said. Other senators on the committee said it could take up to 60 days. Army Maj. Gen. Roger L. Cloutier Jr., the chief of staff of the military’s Africa Command in Germany, is leading the inquiry.

“It’s clearer, but there’s still a lot of things that they don’t know,” said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. “Why did it take 48 hours to find Sergeant Johnson? We don’t know that yet.”

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said many lawmakers were surprised to learn the scope of American military missions in Africa and, in particular, the size of the military presence in Niger, where 800 United States troops conduct training missions and drone operations. “I don’t think Congress has been completely kept up to date,” Mr. Kaine said.

The mystery of what happened that day only deepened as new details emerged from interviews with more than a half dozen military officers, Pentagon officials and lawmakers this week.

On the night of Oct. 3, two groups set off in rural southwest Niger. One was a team of American, French and Nigerien commandos on a clandestine operation to kill or capture an Islamic State operative, part of a broader mission code-named Obsidian Nomad. The other group — made up of about eight Army Special Forces, three American soldiers in support roles and their interpreter, along with 30 Nigerien troops — was on a separate reconnaissance patrol. At some later point, the team was asked to back up the first group if needed.

Bad weather scotched the raid, intended to be launched from helicopters. But the second group remained in the region, after being asked by commanders to search further for evidence of the Islamic State jihadist, code-named Naylor Road by the military.

On the morning of Oct. 4, the team swung through the village of Tongo Tongo to resupply and met with local elders out of courtesy. Villagers might have tipped off Islamic State militants in the area, Nigerien and American military officials have said. One military official, however, said on Thursday that a villager told the troops that an important Islamic State emir was in the area, possibly alerting them that the extremists were approaching.

Shortly after the American soldiers, who were led by an Army captain, and the Nigerien troops left the village, heading back to base about two hours away, some 50 Islamic State militants armed with machine guns and heavy weapons ambushed the group at about 11:40 a.m. local time.

Lightly armed with no heavy weapons of their own, the American and Nigerien forces tried to defend themselves. Outgunned and taking casualties, the soldiers tried to stand their ground until additional Nigerien troops rushed to the scene.

It was not clear when the Nigeriens, along with French troops, arrived, but American officials indicated that they had made it to the ambush site by the time the seven Americans were evacuated.

When troops from the elite Joint Special Operations Command were alerted to the situation, however, they were told that several Americans were missing. That calls into question Pentagon officials’ earlier assertions that either the Nigerien forces or French helicopters were with the bodies of at least three of the soldiers until they were recovered — an insistence that underscores the mantra that no soldier is left behind.

“The U.S. military does not leave our troops behind,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week.

Eventually, the team of American commandos originally scheduled to target the Islamic State militant the previous night were dropped near the ambush site and found the bodies of three of their comrades: Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright.

But at least one American was still missing. Commandos from Sigonella, Italy, and Djibouti rushed to Niger’s capital, Niamey, while a reserve unit of Special Forces stationed at Africa Command headquarters in Germany prepared to deploy if needed. Sergeant Johnson’s body was found by Nigeriens on the evening of Oct. 6.

After the ambush, American units in the region were forced to change radio frequencies because communications equipment was missing and believed compromised by enemy forces.

The American-backed operations to topple the Islamic State from its strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, could increase the risks in Africa, if Islamic State fighters flee to the continent to continue their mayhem there, as some have begun to do.

“The more we succeed in the Middle East, the more we’re going to see the snakes run to Africa,” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said on Thursday. “We’ve got to be prepared to advise and assist the nations there that are willing to work with us.”

Some lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called for hearings to help explain what went wrong in Niger.

“I need to be able to look families in the eye and explain what our mission is, what mistakes were made in this incident, who made them and why,” Mr. Blumenthal said.","U.S. Soldiers Were Separated From Unit in Niger Ambush, Officials Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/africa/niger-soldiers-killed-ambush.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I think I can still get us up on the roof,” Kenny Scharf enthusiastically offered, pointing to a nearby building. We had already spent nearly three hours that afternoon bounding around his old East Village stomping grounds, searching for the murals he’d painted decades ago after becoming one of the New York art world’s biggest stars.

I was writing a story on a new Museum of Modern Art exhibition centering on work by the artists — Mr. Scharf, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat chief among them — who turned a bar called Club 57 into the nightly headquarters of the early ’80s East Village art scene. As these artists’ media profiles — and attendant market prices — have risen in recent years (posthumously, in the cases of Mr. Haring and Mr. Basquiat), my mission was to say something fresh about a scene that continues to see no shortage of ink spilled over it.

One solution: Focus on the setting. Return with Mr. Scharf to familiar terrain, and not simply for an easy bit of now-versus-then real estate appreciation. Now 59, he showed little sign of slowing down, and the photographer Andrew White and I did our best to keep up. I frantically scribbled notes, walking and asking questions, while Mr. White lugged a huge duffel bag of camera equipment, taking bursts of shots as Mr. Scharf raced on and off the subway, in and out of traffic, finally landing at the onetime location of Club 57.

Mr. Scharf felt that a shot from atop that nearby roof would be perfect. Never mind that he didn’t know anyone who currently lived in the building.

Mr. Lithgow himself is anything but eldritch, despite his dazzling and dark portrayal of the serial killer Arthur Mitchell on the Showtime series “Dexter,” for which he won a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy. A sunny and enthusiastic personality, Mr. Lithgow calls his crossword puzzle collaboration with the veteran New York Times constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley an “exhilarating experience.”

Rather than walk onto the stage of a theater, step onto a television or film set, or put pen to paper to write one of his books for children, Mr. Lithgow scaled a very steep learning curve with Mr. Quigley, and the result is an entertaining puzzle that definitely has his signature on it.

Since then, I have been reporting their stories and creating a “true comic” about their lives in America. I went to their mosques, schools and job-training programs. I was also there when Ammar’s family received a frightening death threat, which ultimately forced them to flee their town.

“I don’t think that’s a very good way to pick a Fed chair, so I declined to participate,” said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, an increasingly outspoken critic of Mr. Trump’s style of governance.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought advice from a TV personality, turning the tables on Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network in the middle of an interview.

“Tell me who your preference is,” Mr. Trump said. He pressed repeatedly for an answer from the visibly flustered host. Mr. Dobbs finally endorsed Ms. Yellen.

Mr. Trump responded: “She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it’s somebody that I am thinking about.” But, he continued, “I have to say you’d like to make your own mark,” suggesting that he might be inclined to nominate someone else.

The White House would like to announce a final decision by Nov. 3.

Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the most unusual aspect of Mr. Trump’s deliberations was the diversity of the candidates.

Presidents generally decide what kind of chairman they want and then pick a nominee.

President Jimmy Carter, who chose twice, first decided that he wanted an industrial executive, settling on G. William Miller, the head of Textron. Nearly 17 months later, deciding he wanted someone respected by financial markets, Mr. Carter picked Paul Volcker.

President Ronald Reagan renominated Mr. Volcker, then chose Alan Greenspan, draining the drama from the process for almost two decades. In 2003, President George W. Bush offered Mr. Greenspan a fifth term a year before the end of his fourth term.

When Mr. Greenspan retired in 2006, Mr. Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke from a list of three Ivy League economists who had served as Republican policy advisers.

President Barack Obama renominated Mr. Bernanke, then sought a replacement among Democratic economists who embraced the Fed’s power to reduce unemployment. Supporters of Ms. Yellen and her main rival, Lawrence H. Summers, battled publicly, but it was a contest over personalities, not ideas.

Mr. Trump’s choice, by contrast, could have significant consequences for the direction of Fed policy. Mr. Powell, who supported the Fed’s efforts to stimulate economic growth, now favors a gradual unwinding of those policies. Mr. Taylor opposed the stimulus campaign, and he has called for the Fed to retreat more quickly.

“If you’re taking seriously reappointing Yellen or nominating Powell, well, that’s light years away from Taylor,” Ms. Binder said. “It just raises the question: What is the basis on which the president is conducting the search?”

One possible explanation is that Mr. Trump is struggling with the imperatives of a polarized political environment. He has repeatedly praised Ms. Yellen for her performance as Fed chairwoman. The economy is growing and the stock market is rising, and Mr. Trump wants both trends to continue. But conservatives are pressing Mr. Trump to seize the opportunity to shift the approach of the central bank by appointing Mr. Taylor.

Three House Republicans, including Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday pressing for new leadership at the Fed. Republicans want to constrain the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy, and to install a Fed chairman who is supportive of efforts to reduce financial regulation.

Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, favor the nomination of Mr. Powell as a kind of middle road: a Republican likely to maintain the Fed’s course on monetary policy, but with greater sympathy for relaxing financial regulation.

Ms. Binder said that replacing Ms. Yellen would reinforce the growing tendency to view the Fed as a partisan political institution, with every president picking a new chairman.

“If anything is being broken here it’s the norm of bipartisan continuity at the Fed, and it is always to the Fed’s benefit to look bipartisan and to be bipartisan,” she said. “It raises fewer questions about what is motivating the Fed’s choice of monetary policy.”

But Peter Conti-Brown, a legal studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is writing a political history of the Fed, said that Mr. Trump was simply making explicit the longstanding reality that presidents seek to influence the course of monetary policy.

Indeed, Mr. Conti-Brown said he saw a silver lining in Mr. Trump’s showmanship, and in the diversity of the candidates, because it was providing a rare opportunity for the public to compare and debate different views of the Fed’s role in the economy.

“I think it’s all to the very good to generate discussion about what the Fed is, what the different approaches are, whether they’re good or bad,” he said. “This is the only time the public gets to weigh in. If you don’t think the Fed should operate in the shadowy corners of the administrative state, this is exactly what accountability looks like.”",Trump’s Latest Show: Choosing a Fed Chairman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-fed-chairman.html

Unlike, say, fine art or coins, the growth in sports memorabilia collecting has been a function of a collision of demographics, economics and technology. For decades, players routinely gave away their autographs and their gear, including balls, bats and jerseys. Babe Ruth, baseball’s biggest titan, signed his name for almost anyone who asked. Trading cards were mostly collected by children, though starting in the 1930s, visionaries like Jefferson Burdick created a cataloging system that became the foundation of the industry years later.

It wasn’t until the go-go years of the 1980s, when the first baby boomers were reaching middle age, that large amounts of money poured into the sports memorabilia market, especially for baseball-related items, which make up about 70 percent of the vintage market. The value of trading cards for the most famous players including Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron jumped. So did autographs and signed photographs. Serious collectors began paying five-, six- and even seven-figure sums for scarce items, like jerseys worn by Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and others, and ballplayers like Pete Rose were paid thousands of dollars to appear at autograph signings.

But like any unregulated market, the risk of fraud was ever-present. To the unsuspecting buyer, an autograph could be forged and an ordinary ball substituted for a rare one. And the internet, which helped match buyers with sellers, was also used to pawn off fakes.

So in time, insurers started writing policies that covered sports memorabilia and authenticators began to verify the legitimacy of cards and other items. Sports leagues, sensing a chance to enhance interest in their games, have also been authenticating game-used bats, balls, jerseys and other items. And while authenticators have not been above reproach, their entry into the market has generally reassured buyers.

“Any industry where authentication has been introduced, the market has flourished, whether it’s baseball cards, comic books or game worn jerseys,” said Troy Kinunen, who is in charge of consignments, sales and purchases at Mears Online Auctions in South Milwaukee. “Authentication created consumer confidence and consumer confidence create higher prices.”

Higher prices, he added, have also attracted thieves, the ultimate backhanded compliment. In recent years, a rash of sports museums have been pilfered, with thieves getting away with Yogi Berra’s World Series rings, Roger Maris’s most valuable player plaque from 1960, the 1903 Belmont Stakes trophy, and a replica of an alligator-skin belt with a solid gold buckle given to the golfer Ben Hogan. None of the items have been recovered.

Perhaps the most brazen theft occurred this year, when a journalist and memorabilia collector from Mexico stole the jersey worn by Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, out of his locker soon after the Patriots Super Bowl victory. After an investigation spanning two countries, the jersey — which some experts said was worth about half a million dollars — was recovered about a month later.

“People are realizing the value and demand of it,” said James Spence, the founder of JSA, a company that verifies the legitimacy of sports memorabilia.

The demand, it seems, is insatiable, at least for the most coveted items, the values of which have risen so reliably in the past several decades that some people are investing in sports memorabilia to diversify their portfolios, according to Chris Ivy, the director of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions in Dallas who is currently selling the only known jersey worn by Jackie Robinson in 1947, his rookie season.

“There’s only so much you can put in real estate and Wall Street,” said Mr. Ivy, whose company handles about $60 million in auction sales annually. “Collectibles in general are seeing a lot of growth and sports is seeing most of that.”

But for every investor looking to make a buck, there are hundreds if not thousands more who collect because they love a sport, team or player. The great thing about sports compared to, say, stamps, which younger people rarely use now, is there is always another generation of fans who turn into collectors.

Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.

But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel. So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans’ bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn. Did one take precedence over the other? If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.

Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.

The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.

To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.

During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them. The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember. This was their mental task.

On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.

Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.

Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task. Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.

But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump. The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.

“Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource,” which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.

And the brain won.

The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly. The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues. They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.

But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.

“For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical,” he says. “An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human. This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.”

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be “a bunch of false promises to the middle class.” Republicans, he said, “know the details — the specifics of what they’re really about — will be hard to argue in the sunlight.”

Lawmakers and committee staff members must still resolve some of the thorniest issues before they can release a bill, including where to draw income lines for tax brackets, how high to set the top personal income tax rate and how to ensure that major changes to the way that multinational corporations are taxed do not encourage them to shift more money overseas. The biggest question is how to offset enough tax revenue that will be lost from cutting rates to remain within the rules of the Senate budget reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster.

The budget measure approved on Thursday would allow for a tax bill that adds as much as $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, at a time when the federal government’s debt has already topped $20 trillion. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

The outline of the tax plan unveiled in September would cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent; collapse individual income tax brackets from seven to three or four, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, and possibly one higher; and nearly double the standard deduction, to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly.

The budget measure passed over the loud protests of House members from New York and New Jersey, who worry that the blueprint will doom the current deduction for state and local taxes — a benefit of great importance to taxpayers in their states. Eleven of the 20 Republicans who voted no were from those two states.

“This isn’t over,” one of those lawmakers, Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, a Republican, said after the vote. “I am confident we’ll reach an agreement. And if we don’t, then I don’t see how we can move forward.”

Mr. Brady told reporters later in the day that while no such agreement had yet been reached, it would eventually be resolved, since families in New York and New Jersey needed to be “better off” after a tax bill passes.

“This is a serious issue, and we’re taking it seriously,” Mr. Brady said. Republican lawmakers from those states “made it clear they need this problem solved before they vote yes on tax reform,” he added.

Democrats were quick to seize on the discord. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had put his party’s control of the House at even greater risk through his “foolish decision to force his most vulnerable members to walk the plank on a toxic tax increase.”

“Anybody who votes for this thing should have their head examined if they live where we do,” said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York.

In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, President Trump and Mr. Brady have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate matter.

House Republicans, over Mr. Trump’s public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year. On Thursday, Mr. Brady hinted that the bill may raise the limit on the total amount Americans can save in tax-preferred accounts but shift the tax preference to the back end, so that a larger share of those contributions are taxed up front, instead of when they are withdrawn, as is the case with 401(k) plans.

Such a change would produce more tax revenues in the short term, at the expense of the long run, which would help Republicans make their tax math work. One possible reason to consider that change would be to offset revenues lost from a deal to preserve some of the state and local deduction for individuals.

A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings. The House’s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit. But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.

House Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.

Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome, but she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.

“President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly,” she said.

And while Republicans expressed cautious optimism that they could resolve their differences, avoid lobbying pitfalls and deliver the bill to Mr. Trump for his signature in December, Democrats warned that the ride could be rough.

“It’s easy to understand why they want to rush a bill like this through, because the more people see it, the less they’ll like it,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat. “It’ll be a lot tougher for them to get it done than they think.”","House Passes Budget Blueprint, Clearing Path for Tax Overhaul",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/house-budget-blueprint-tax-cut.html

Pine Island glacier

Glaciers are essentially long rivers of ice. Just as a river collects water that drains from a specific area, Antarctica’s glaciers collect ice from parts of the great ice sheets that cover the continent. The amount of ice that could flow into the Pine Island glacier and then into the sea would eventually raise the world’s sea level by over a foot and a half.

The animation above shows Pine Island glacier flowing into the Amundsen Sea from 2014 to 2017. Twice in that period, the glacier released an iceberg larger than 100 square miles.

The Pine Island’s flow is accelerating rapidly. Its ice shelf, an expanse of ice that floats on water where the glacier meets the sea, has increased its speed by 75 percent from 1973 to 2010.

“This is a result of the warmer waters in front of them,” said Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who has done extensive research on polar ice.

“In some relatively colder years, we know the melt rate slowed down and the glaciers slowed down. On warm ocean years, the glacier moves really fast.”

In the 1980s, Pine Island gained about as much ice as it lost every year. Now, the glacier is out of balance.

Thwaites glacier

About 100 miles southwest of Pine Island, Thwaites glacier is also shedding more and more ice into the ocean.

The amount of ice that could flow into it and then into the sea would increase global sea level by more than two feet.

Because Thwaites is about 75 miles wide and isn’t confined to a valley the way Pine Island is, there is potential for much larger releases of ice if the glacier’s flow continues to speed up.

“These two glaciers could easily flow two to three times faster — that’s what the models show,” Dr. Rignot said. “If Pine Island’s shelf were to break up, the glacier would respond by speeding up two to three times.”

Thwaites glacier also veered from equilibrium in the late 1980s, but hasn’t been shedding as much ice as Pine Island.

This year’s ice calving events at Pine Island and Thwaites have not caused significant changes in the region, because the shifts have been in areas that did not provide critical support to the glaciers.

The movement of the ice, however, offers scientists a window into how Antarctic ice shelves might respond to rapid changes and how a runaway disintegration of the hundreds of Antarctic glaciers might look.","In Antarctica, Two Crucial Glaciers Accelerate Toward the Sea",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/26/climate/antarctica-glaciers-melt.html

The dinner parties started years ago in an unfinished loft in industrial Brooklyn: chickens cooked in a balky oven and served on a banged-up old table someone found on the street. My wife and I were unmarried then, childless, but already, it seemed, in the process of building a sort of home, the sort we wanted to live in, where there’s always something happening in the kitchen, always a lot of people bustling about and always an extra seat for whoever’s around: friends from college, from work, from the bar. We’d put the call out on a weekend morning: You free for dinner? Then make a salad to go with the meat, roast some potatoes with onions and rosemary, slide a few baguettes onto the table, serve a lot of wine. We did this often enough that the eating became not just simple sustenance but instead a kind of rolling weekly party of six people, eight, 10, informal and slightly disorganized, our room filled with conversation and good cheer. Eventually the calls started coming in rather than going out: You cooking tonight?

Later we cooked in an airy apartment a few miles north, next to a candle factory that filled the air with strange vanilla scents: big feeds of shredded pork or brisket and heaps of steamed greens, as babies slept in their car seats next to their parents’ chairs. We were a family by then, in fact as much as spirit. We moved the babies east, to a tiny old house on the end of Long Island where we would put a dozen or more people around a table for eight to eat epic meals of clams and corn, ribs and rice. Arms got tangled as people who sometimes hardly knew one another reached for the food. Someone put a name to that, to the way you’d have to snake your arm under someone else’s just to get to the butter, the salad, a bottle, the salt: the boardinghouse reach.

Table Talk Go for empathy when you talk politics. Showing how a political issue affects you intimately is more important than data and statistics. Try leading with a personal story.

We took the boardinghouse reach to dinners in Connecticut after that, where we simmered chili and cooked fragrant roast lamb and served it outside on a picnic table under towering oaks after picking up friends at the train. We took it to Maine, where we cooked on a wood stove and ate over a plywood table lighted with kerosene lamps: cod cakes, slaw, chicken paprikash. We reached across tables on sticky urban roofs under the night sky, in suburban yards under string lights, in rooms that were small and dingy, large and luxurious. We cooked for family real and imagined, usually casually, occasionally formally, ideally somewhere between the two. The point was just to cook — or, more accurate, the point was just to get people to gather around a table and eat, and to do so regularly enough that they knew that it would happen again soon.

Is that a proper dinner party, to eat that way? It is when the company’s good and you can have ice-cream sandwiches for dessert. There won’t be coasters for the cocktails, and you’ll need to hold on to your fork between courses — if indeed there are courses. Coats will be piled on a bed or draped over a banister in the hall. You may need to sit on a stool or a box. But there will always be candles set out and hot dogs in the back of the fridge if someone’s kid doesn’t like the mushrooms in the lasagna or the oxtails in the stew. A dinner party to me is just dinner, served to a crowd that can ebb or flood depending on the season or the weather, on whether a call went out or a work schedule changed.

This sort of entertaining requires flexibility in planning. When all are welcome, people bring other people. So you will want to ask your guests to bring beverages and flowers and other markers of good cheer. Asking helps underscore the message of the night: We’re all in this together. (I always ask for dessert.) To that end as well, don’t cook food that’s portioned as single servings — go with things that can easily be spread across more portions than you’d planned, in case someone brings a new girlfriend, some kid’s friends, somebody’s mom or dad. I like tacos for that, huge salads, lots of potatoes.

Table Talk To ensure a guest’s story becomes truly interesting, just ask two questions over and over: what and why. What exactly happened? What did that feel like? Seek emotional specifics. And then: Why? Why is this anecdote important? This is where the guest’s most thoughtful connection to a story lies.

For much the same reason, a dinner party of the sort I enjoy demands a casual approach to setting the table and to setting a time when you’re actually going to eat. You want to edge into the evenings slowly, engaging in a kind of hospitality that encourages repose rather than nervousness that you’re not going to know which fork to use when you eventually sit down. That takes a kind of confidence, the sort you gain only by practice. It requires that you act as a host. Make sure there is music playing, though not so loudly that you can’t hear people talk. Then, as people arrive, make sure they get a glass of wine or a beer or a rather larger cocktail than they’d make for themselves. Introduce the outgoing ones to people they don’t know; lead the shy to their friends or put them to work in the kitchen, peeling vegetables or stirring a pot. And soon enough it happens, right in front of you: Conversation burbles, runs to fishing and novels, to politics and farming, nearly always to real estate, always to laughs. I watch the energy build. It always builds.

And then, when there’s a good, convivial buzz in the air, I call everyone to attention and serve shellfish in the kitchen or out in the yard, steamed clams or shucked oysters or peel-your-own shrimp, meant to be consumed standing up, as if we were animals at a trough, though the sort of animals who drink prosecco with their feed. I do that because it’s delicious and different (we’re not sitting down?) and special, but also because I believe it acts as a kind of dinner bell in the universe, a dog whistle heard by only my knucklehead friends who said they’d be coming at 6 but then got caught up in replacing a water filter on the boat until well after 7.

Dinner at last! The candles are flickering, and everyone’s ready to eat, and you may find yourself nervous that you haven’t made enough food, particularly because you’ve seen the damage that the big fellow who came with Jim’s sister put on the clams. Never worry. Put everything out as a buffet, or arrange platters family-style at the table, and let your guests have at the feast. The modern parable of the loaves and fishes does not require a miracle, merely adherence to a social contract that makes everyone responsible for ensuring there’s enough food for all. I have served these meals for more than 20 years. There is almost always enough food for all. Indeed, and particularly for those just starting out, there are usually leftovers. The best dinner parties offer memories that last a long time, and a few extra meals besides.

Are we somehow complicit when we encounter art in a safe, gilded house? Or, in fact, can grappling with the arts, including this powerful opera, be a way to take action and exert will?

In this audacious opera — for which Tom Cairns, the director of the production, wrote the libretto in collaboration with Mr. Adès — the music digs deep. Mr. Adès’s wild, searing score explores the emotional undercurrents of the story and fleshes out the horror of the characters’ situation.

My one reservation about the opera when I first heard it was that to some degree, Mr. Adès explored the dark side of Buñuel’s tale, which has been seen as a bitter critique of elite classes during Franco’s regime in Spain, at the expense of its bizarrely comic elements.

But after hearing it at the Met, I feel different. Mr. Adès’s thorny, modernist music, played with crackling precision and color by the orchestra, bristled with manic, almost madcap, energy.

Take the crucial opening scenes, which hew pretty closely to the film. The servants of the house, who somehow sense disaster coming, have fled; and the hostess, Lucía de Nobile (the bright-voiced soprano Amanda Echalaz) is frantic with embarrassment. Her prickly husband, Edmundo (the suave tenor Joseph Kaiser), is also utterly indignant.

But Mr. Adès captures both the tension and absurdity of the crisis in a complex ensemble. The hosts greet their guests with unctuous exchanges, while the visitors, in overlapping and comically elongated phrases, voice refrains of “Enchanted, enchanted,” as the orchestra erupts with jumpy outbursts.

Video

The effect here is compounded by a prankish yet gripping touch in Mr. Cairns’s brilliant staging. The set (by Hildegard Bechtler, who also designed the costumes) shows a salon, with fine couches and glittering tables, framed by a large wooden structure that resembles an opera house proscenium. Only when the guests arrived onstage did the chandeliers in the Met’s auditorium start rising to the roof.

Though “The Exterminating Angel” is a true ensemble piece, Mr. Adès gives distinct character traits and defining musical moments to most of the 15 solo roles. The coloratura soprano Audrey Luna, whose stratospheric upper range was put to use by Mr. Adès in his previous opera “The Tempest” (presented at the Met in 2012) excels as Leticia, an opera singer who had starred in the performance the guests have attended: The dinner party is in her honor.

But as hours and days go by, and everyone becomes increasingly confused and degraded, Leticia unravels, dispatching accusations in vocal bursts that reach screechy highs, yet somehow sound angelic.

Another guest, Blanca, a pianist (the mezzo-soprano Christine Rice), agrees to play something. In the film, the character performs a snappy 18th-century keyboard piece. Mr. Adès substitutes his own haunting variations on a song from the Ladino tradition of Sephardic Jews, music that captures the ambiguity of the moment.

It’s as if Blanca is searching through music’s past for clarity and willpower, yet speaking in a confused modern voice. Blanca arrives with her husband, Alberto (baritone Rod Gilfry), a conductor, and Leticia’s colleague, who proceeds to fall asleep on a couch while confusion reigns.

The soprano Sally Matthews brings a radiant voice and natural allure to Silvia de Ávila, a young widowed aristocrat who has a strangely close relationship with her prissy brother, Francesco (the vibrant countertenor Iestyn Davies).

Two tragic guests, in the face of unreality, seek solace together. Beatriz (the soprano Sophie Bevan) and Eduardo (the tenor David Portillo) are engaged and utterly absorbed in themselves. But Mr. Adès enshrouds them in the opera’s most rapturous music, an extended duet with sighing vocal lines and quizzical orchestral sonorities. In a suicide pact, the couple enjoy their first night of love in a closet, where they are later discovered dead.

The veteran bass John Tomlinson commands the stage as the elderly Doctor Conde, who is accompanied by his terminally ill patient Leonora, a needy woman obsessed with the occult, here the compelling mezzo-soprano Alice Coote.

As an opera composer, Mr. Adès often has the orchestra hug every note and syllable of a vocal line. This stylistic trait could easily be overdone. But the chords and sonorities he comes up with at once buttress and shake up vocal lines, so the effect, in his hands, lends intriguing dramatic complexity. Over all, this riveting, breathless, score — full of quick-cutting shifts, pointillist bursts, and episodes of ballistic intensity — may be his best work.

The anguished scene that will stay with me for a long while came late, a moment of motherly longing, when Silvia, now grimy, haggard and delirious, thinks about her little boy. She sings a fractured lullaby while caressing the head of a dead sheep (and how actual sheep come into the picture, I won’t give away). Silvia sounds as if she is recalling some distant, old hymn tune. Yet the disjointed orchestra grumbles ominously in its depths while miniature violins play weirdly high, skittish sounds.

On Thursday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 10 North Korean officials and organizations, including one North Korean diplomat based in China who has been accused of forcing North Korean asylum seekers to return home.
The exercise, scheduled while Mr. Trump is traveling through the region, will undoubtedly be interpreted as another warning toward Pyongyang.
During a brief session with American troops in Seoul, Mr. Mattis said that American military might in the region was meant to back up its diplomacy.
“We’re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can,” Mr. Mattis said.","But even if the United States and South Korea were able to do so, American defense officials acknowledge that North Korea would still have a significant retaliatory capability, including chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as conventional forces. It would be virtually impossible, the officials said, to destroy all of North Korea’s offensive capabilities before it could strike Seoul.

Mr. Mattis’s very helicopter ride to the DMZ illustrated Seoul’s vulnerability. The defense secretary took 30 minutes, by Black Hawk helicopter, to get to the border, though the trip could easily have easily been done in 10, so short is the distance.

Mr. Mattis’s copter circled the hills and flatlands that dot the densely packed region. He flew over a succession of high-rise residential complexes and surveyed armored tank positions. But even by road, the trip from Seoul to the DMZ would have taken under an hour with no traffic.

Both Mr. Mattis and Mr. Song appeared in somber dark suits despite reports in the South Korean news media that Mr. Song had wanted them to wear their old military uniforms. Mr. Mattis “wouldn’t do that,” said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon press spokesman accompanying the defense secretary. Captain Davis said he could not confirm whether Mr. Song actually made the suggestion, but he added that Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, was aware that defense secretary was a civilian post.

The issue underscores the fine line that the United States and South Korea are trying to walk in dealing with North Korea’s recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests.

The last thing that Seoul wants is for the United States to make good on all of President Trump’s threats about military options — South Koreans know that they would be the first to feel the repercussions.

But at the same time, both South Korea and the United States want Pyongyang to think that Washington might launch a strike, in the hope that fears of such action might force North Korea to the bargaining table over its weapons programs.

“Our goal is not war,” Mr. Mattis said, “but rather the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”

He called North Korea an “oppressive regime that shackles its people, denying their freedom, their welfare and their human dignity,” and said that Pyongyang’s “provocations continue to threaten regional and global security.”

As he spoke, patriotic North Korean music wafted through the air from speakers over the border. (The Americans and South Koreans routinely retaliate by blasting Korean pop music.) North Korean soldiers stationed just yards away from Mr. Mattis snapped photographs of him, while others peered through the window of the so-called Joint Security Area, a sort-of neutral spot in the DMZ meant for diplomatic engagements, as Mr. Mattis took a tour.

Mr. Mattis’s boss will be following in his footsteps next month, when Mr. Trump visits Seoul as part of a nearly two-week trip to Asia. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will also travel to the demilitarized zone, a common stop for American presidents.

For the Trump administration, the Korea situation has been complex, in no small part because it now seems as if every time Mr. Trump threatens the North, Pyongyang carries out another nuclear or ballistic missile test. North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test last month. And since Mr. Trump took office, it has launched several missiles, including ones capable of reaching the mainland United States.

On Thursday, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 10 North Korean officials and organizations, including one North Korean diplomat based in China who has been accused of forcing North Korean asylum seekers to return home.

Separately, the Pentagon said it was planning military exercises next month involving three of the Navy’s aircraft carrier strike groups in the Asia-Pacific region. The exercise, scheduled while Mr. Trump is traveling through the region, will undoubtedly be interpreted as another warning toward Pyongyang.

Defense officials said that the show of military might was intended to demonstrate American capabilities in the region. But they cautioned that any American military strike against North Korea would come at a huge cost — one that neither Washington or Seoul may be prepared to pay.

During a brief session with American troops in Seoul, Mr. Mattis said that American military might in the region was meant to back up its diplomacy.

“We’re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can,” Mr. Mattis said. “But ultimately our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.

“Bannon is a smart man,” smiles Cuban, who has huddled with the strategist.

I met the voluble owner of the Dallas Mavericks at Jean-Georges in the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle, where he keeps an apartment. It seemed a bit dicey to be discussing a possible coup at the same elegant eatery where the president-elect tortured Mitt Romney by dangling the secretary of state job over sautéed frogs’ legs.

But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read “Stronger Than Lions.”

When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: “Probably, or a Republican. I’m registered as an independent. I mean, I’d rather do it as an independent.” But running as an independent has not proved successful in modern times. You just become a spoiler like Ross Perot. (Who is Cuban’s neighbor in Dallas, along with W.)

Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump’s election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, “Wow, if that dude can do it…,” and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls “headline porn,” or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?

The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as “Trump without the crazy.” He calls Trump batty but has also written that it’s good to have “the edge,” when “people think you’re crazy and they are right, but you don’t care what they think.”

He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. “I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up,” he says. “When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn’t take much space and they’re expensive.”

He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire — a moment recreated by Cuban’s mentally unhinged doppelgänger on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Russ Hanneman.

“Look, there are people who are saying we don’t need another business person,” he says, sipping iced tea. “But it’s about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I’d want to come in with proof of an agenda, ‘Here’s a health care solution and I’ve already paid my own money to have it scored.’

“They always say that people vote against what they didn’t like about the previous president, right? And I think he’s so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who’s not a politician. If that’s a celebrity, that’s just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?”

He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I’m going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I’m going to need a commitment from you that you’re going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.

“If you did that,” he says, “you’d be a hero.”

Asked if he would send the Mavericks’ former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, “Why not?”

Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.

But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks’ point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on “Shark Tank,” Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.

He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: “I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves.”

In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, “If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it’s late at night, I’m walking to the other side of the street,” and if he sees a white guy who “has tattoos all over his face,” he’d do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.

But Cuban can empathize with Trump. “If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that’s Donald Trump,” Cuban says. “He’s overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where’s the list of entrepreneurs who say, ‘He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me’?”

I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a “neurotic dope” and Cuban an “arrogant, crude, dope” who is “not smart enough to run for president.”

“There are three Donald Trumps,” he says. “Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll.” Trump’s Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy “screaming at a sporting event.” (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)

Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary’s running mate or Trump’s. “I wasn’t a Hillary fan, by the way,” he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.

Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?

“They didn’t see it coming at all,” he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. “I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I’m like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.

“In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement.”

He scoffs: “The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn’t collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?”

Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from “The Apprentice” with Trump’s sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn’t have such a tape.

His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. “Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him,” Cuban says. “And I sent him an email back saying, ‘At some point, you have to learn the issues.’ Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?” He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.

Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. “If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours,” he says, “they’re going to kick our ass.”

Cuban always says he’s lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good.” He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a “smart, funny and beautiful” and “a badass.” His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in “Big.” “We’ve got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom,” he says.

He did well, I say, with his samba to the “I Dream of Jeannie” theme on “Dancing With the Stars,” especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.

“I told my wife,” he says, “I don’t want to look back and say I would’ve, could’ve, should’ve.”

Maybe that’s what Cuban is thinking about 2020.",Mark Cuban’s Not Done Trolling Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/mark-cubans-not-done-trolling-donald-trump.html

The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent — by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.

Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for what’s happening with the entire health insurance market. But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types aren’t rising as fast. Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent. Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.

Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well. The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did. In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.

One morning, I headed upriver, where the Margaree grows more sylvan and intimate, resembling an Adirondack trout stream. At Cemetery Pool, I ran into Todd Karnas and Blair Banton. Karnas is a professor of literature at Memorial University in Newfoundland. He had canceled a few classes to spend the week fishing with Banton, a member of the Canadian Coast Guard. As was the case downriver, the fish were showing but not biting. The duo did not seem disheartened. Banton, who has a tattoo of a salmon fly on his left forearm, intensely watched his line swing through the pool.

“We’ll keep at ’er,” he said.

In the middle section of the river, at Etheridge Pool, I watched Anita Coady make a series of graceful casts. Coady’s family has lived in the Margaree Valley for centuries. Though she travels a bit in other seasons, Coady is always sure to be home in the fall. “This place doesn’t ever change,” she said. “Why would you ever want it to?”

At the hub of much of the activity is Alex Breckenridge, the owner of the Tying Scotsman, the only full-service fly shop in the area. Breckenridge, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, ties flies to match the colors of the fall — deep red marabou streamers and bright orange shrimp patterns. He moved here from Ayrshire, Scotland, in 2003 and opened his shop two years ago. “This river is so accommodating,” he said. “All you need is a license and a place to stay.”

Like many, though, Breckenridge worries about the future of Atlantic salmon. A witches’ brew of maladies — including overharvest, habitat degradation and climate change — has caused a precipitous 30-year decline in worldwide Atlantic salmon populations. The species is now listed as endangered in the United States and is extinct on some rivers in southern Nova Scotia.

The Margaree has not been immune to the troubles. But angling organizations, like the international Atlantic Salmon Federation and the local Margaree Salmon Association, have taken steps to try to mitigate the decline. Recent measures on the Margaree include attempts at habitat restoration and a mandated catch-and-release policy on the river.

The declines in the runs have made some wistful for years past. But Gaines and Child shun the nostalgia. “Every week up here, and every day on the river, grants you a new chance,” Child said.

That optimism is a necessary trait for Atlantic salmon anglers. Its adherents are practiced in the art of rejection. The enigmatic species has been called “the fish of 1,000 casts” for good reason. (Atlantic salmon do not feed when they enter freshwater; many believe they strike flies out of some instinct developed as a juvenile in rivers.) Some anglers endure long stretches without catching a fish — I’d gone a full two weeks on the Margaree over the summer without even a strike.

It’s certainly not a sport for everyone, especially those with a steady iPhone habit. For others, though, the patient, repetitive process — and the ability to simultaneously daydream and pay close attention to your fly — is the entire point. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia and an avid Atlantic salmon fisherman, has likened salmon fishing to being stoned.

I’m firmly in Chouinard’s camp: The process is more important than the result. Still, on the last evening of my October trip, I was going on three weeks without a fish. What I wanted more than anything was to feel the pull of an Atlantic salmon — a jolt, always unexpected, like shaking hands with an overeager Texan.

I walked down to the lower river, tied on one of Breckenridge’s red-and-yellow marabou flies and began to cast. On my third swing, my fly suddenly stopped. The water frothed as the salmon leapt twice, completely clearing the surface of the river. Eventually, I tailed her and held her steady in the current, up to my elbows in the water. Her back was lightly bronzed, her flanks silvery. It was getting dark quickly and the air had chilled. My ritual of the fall was at its end. The salmon, with a flick of her strong tail, shot upstream, continuing on with hers.","When Salmon Return to the Margaree, It’s All Fly Rods and Autumn Glory",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/sports/fly-fishing.html

You’d be surprised how often identity theft comes down to misplaced or stolen documents. A few receipts here, a bank statement there, and someone has enough information to apply for a credit card or a loan in your name.

The best way to go is using a cross-cut shredder, which slices paper two ways into small ribbons rather than long straight ones, which can be pieced back together like a puzzle by (very patient) nefarious actors.

Wirecutter recommends the Amazon Basics 12-Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder, which can also handle CDs and old credit cards.

Tools to Keep Those Cables Under Control

Even if you have a dedicated home office, working from home means cables all over (or under) your desk. Charging cables, keyboard and mouse cables, monitor cables, external hard drives and more. The solution? Velcro cable ties! They’re easy to remove and reapply whenever you need to move things around.

Wirecutter’s favorites — and mine — are Velcro One Wrap Thin Ties. A pack of 100 is only $10, and you can reuse them over and over.

And while you’re getting all of those cables in order, also think about picking up an extra laptop charger and charging cable. The last thing you want is to get home, open your laptop to work and realize you forgot your charger at the office or in another room.

A Quality USB Headset

Working from home often means peace and quiet (if you don’t have kids or pets interrupting you), but it also means checking in with the office occasionally via conference call or video chat. For those moments, you’ll need a solid USB headset with a good microphone so everyone at the office can hear you and good enough audio quality so you can hear them.

A Lap Desk, for Those Couch Working Sessions

I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that working from home sometimes means working in bed or working from the couch in front of the TV. (Call it an office perk.)

When the couch calls, just remember not to keep your laptop on your lap for too long. Some models can get hot enough to burn, and even if yours doesn’t, it can make you clammy and uncomfortable. Grab a lap desk instead: You get a stable work space for your laptop, and your legs get to breathe.

But conservatives are pressing Mr. Trump to seize the opportunity to shift the approach of the central bank by appointing Mr. Taylor.","On Tuesday, he conducted an informal poll of Senate Republicans, asking them to raise a hand for either Mr. Powell or Mr. Taylor. Some refused.

“I don’t think that’s a very good way to pick a Fed chair, so I declined to participate,” said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, an increasingly outspoken critic of Mr. Trump’s style of governance.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought advice from a TV personality, turning the tables on Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network in the middle of an interview.

“Tell me who your preference is,” Mr. Trump said. He pressed repeatedly for an answer from the visibly flustered host. Mr. Dobbs finally endorsed Ms. Yellen.

Mr. Trump responded: “She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it’s somebody that I am thinking about.” But, he continued, “I have to say you’d like to make your own mark,” suggesting that he might be inclined to nominate someone else.

The White House would like to announce a final decision by Nov. 3.

Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the most unusual aspect of Mr. Trump’s deliberations was the diversity of the candidates.

Presidents generally decide what kind of chairman they want and then pick a nominee.

President Jimmy Carter, who chose twice, first decided that he wanted an industrial executive, settling on G. William Miller, the head of Textron. Nearly 17 months later, deciding he wanted someone respected by financial markets, Mr. Carter picked Paul Volcker.

President Ronald Reagan renominated Mr. Volcker, then chose Alan Greenspan, draining the drama from the process for almost two decades. In 2003, President George W. Bush offered Mr. Greenspan a fifth term a year before the end of his fourth term.

When Mr. Greenspan retired in 2006, Mr. Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke from a list of three Ivy League economists who had served as Republican policy advisers.

President Barack Obama renominated Mr. Bernanke, then sought a replacement among Democratic economists who embraced the Fed’s power to reduce unemployment. Supporters of Ms. Yellen and her main rival, Lawrence H. Summers, battled publicly, but it was a contest over personalities, not ideas.

Mr. Trump’s choice, by contrast, could have significant consequences for the direction of Fed policy. Mr. Powell, who supported the Fed’s efforts to stimulate economic growth, now favors a gradual unwinding of those policies. Mr. Taylor opposed the stimulus campaign, and he has called for the Fed to retreat more quickly.

“If you’re taking seriously reappointing Yellen or nominating Powell, well, that’s light years away from Taylor,” Ms. Binder said. “It just raises the question: What is the basis on which the president is conducting the search?”

One possible explanation is that Mr. Trump is struggling with the imperatives of a polarized political environment. He has repeatedly praised Ms. Yellen for her performance as Fed chairwoman. The economy is growing and the stock market is rising, and Mr. Trump wants both trends to continue. But conservatives are pressing Mr. Trump to seize the opportunity to shift the approach of the central bank by appointing Mr. Taylor.

Three House Republicans, including Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday pressing for new leadership at the Fed. Republicans want to constrain the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy, and to install a Fed chairman who is supportive of efforts to reduce financial regulation.

Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, favor the nomination of Mr. Powell as a kind of middle road: a Republican likely to maintain the Fed’s course on monetary policy, but with greater sympathy for relaxing financial regulation.

Ms. Binder said that replacing Ms. Yellen would reinforce the growing tendency to view the Fed as a partisan political institution, with every president picking a new chairman.

“If anything is being broken here it’s the norm of bipartisan continuity at the Fed, and it is always to the Fed’s benefit to look bipartisan and to be bipartisan,” she said. “It raises fewer questions about what is motivating the Fed’s choice of monetary policy.”

But Peter Conti-Brown, a legal studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is writing a political history of the Fed, said that Mr. Trump was simply making explicit the longstanding reality that presidents seek to influence the course of monetary policy.

Indeed, Mr. Conti-Brown said he saw a silver lining in Mr. Trump’s showmanship, and in the diversity of the candidates, because it was providing a rare opportunity for the public to compare and debate different views of the Fed’s role in the economy.

“I think it’s all to the very good to generate discussion about what the Fed is, what the different approaches are, whether they’re good or bad,” he said. “This is the only time the public gets to weigh in. If you don’t think the Fed should operate in the shadowy corners of the administrative state, this is exactly what accountability looks like.”",Trump’s Latest Show: Choosing a Fed Chairman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-fed-chairman.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Mr. Hill raced toward the vehicle — the heroic agent in now-iconic images from that day, climbing aboard Kennedy’s car.

Mr. Hill did not hear the second shot as he hustled to the first family. He heard, and felt, the third. Then he draped his body over the Kennedys. If a fourth shot came, Mr. Hill resolved, it would hit him instead.

“I wish I had been quicker,” he said Thursday.

Making the Washington rounds on the occasion of the documents’ release — somberly greeting well-wishers, signing photographs of his act, demurring at any suggestion of his bravery — Mr. Hill spent his Thursday in search of something more complicated than closure, less tidy than simple vindication.

For decades, Mr. Hill has hoped for clarity on certain questions: Why did Lee Harvey Oswald do it? What was known about his activities in the months before the shooting?

Mr. Hill has not wondered who, precisely, was responsible for the violence of Nov. 22. It was one man, he said — a single gunman, three shots. He believes he is right not because he guessed right, not because he obsessed over it remotely, but because he was there, a fact that has informed every day of his life since.

There has been deep depression, unshakable self-interrogation, a nasty drinking habit.

It was Mr. Hill who could see the hole in the president’s skull that day; Mr. Hill who supplied the instant prognosis, turning to flash his colleagues a frantic thumbs-down; Mr. Hill who informed Robert F. Kennedy by phone, “It’s as bad as it can get.”

Traversing the capital on Thursday, Mr. Hill leaned into the introspection, recounting a career spent serving Kennedy and four other presidents — Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

He wondered aloud why the current one had often floated a baseless theory connecting Oswald to the father of Senator Ted Cruz, a rival for the Republican presidential nomination last year.

“It’s damaging to the presidency, to the office,” Mr. Hill said of President Trump’s handiwork.

He held forth on Caroline Kennedy (“smart girl — I guess I should say ‘lady’ now”), Poland Spring water (“Eisenhower’s water! We used to carry that”) and Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime conspiracy monger and informal adviser to Mr. Trump, whose name was invoked on cable television before Mr. Hill was scheduled to appear on Thursday morning.

“Turn to your left,” he told a seatmate in the MSNBC waiting area, apparently willing to offer a candid assessment of Mr. Stone only if cameras could not decipher any eye contact. “Roger Stone. Ugh.”

For most of his life, Mr. Hill, a North Dakota native who now lives outside San Francisco, has been disinclined to discuss the assassination in public. An exception came in 1975, shortly after he left the Secret Service. During a “60 Minutes” interview with Mike Wallace, Mr. Hill said, he broke down when questions about Dallas caught him off guard.

The next several years were spent largely confined to his basement, he said, sequestered from loved ones and drinking heavily. In the early 1980s, a friend convinced him his choice was clear: Change or die. He cleaned up.

By 1990, while in Texas for a conference, Mr. Hill steeled himself to return for the first time to the site of the assassination. He ventured to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository, where Oswald aimed his rifle at the president, according to the Warren Commission.

“I checked everything,” Mr. Hill said. “Angles. What was the weather like that day? Where exactly was the shooter? Where were we? Everything. And I finally came away knowing that I had done everything I could.”

Guilt and shame persisted, he said, trailing him into old age. In 2009, a friend and former agent asked for his assistance on a book. Talking helped, Mr. Hill found. He decided to do more of it.

His own book followed, a tribute to the woman he protected, titled “Mrs. Kennedy and Me,” written with Lisa McCubbin. They have since written two more books about Mr. Hill’s career.

“Very cathartic,” he said.

By now, Mr. Hill said, the conspiracy theories are little bother, even if he doubts that the document disclosure will discourage them much. On one count, though, Mr. Hill has remained vigilant in defense of his president.

“One last thing,” the TMZ emissary shouted as Mr. Hill returned to his hotel. “Marilyn Monroe!”

Mr. Hill cut him off. “That’s a fallacy,” he said. “Never saw her. And I was there a lot.” He ended the interview, stepping toward the hotel entrance, then turning back to ensure he had dispatched the only cameraman.

Brexit came out of an internal argument Britons have been having since the crash about what their nation is and should be.

The crash increased support for the Scottish Nationalist Party, which won a majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011. In 2014, Scottish voters were asked in a referendum, “Should Scotland be an independent country, yes or no?” The no’s had it. But that wasn’t the end of the story because English nationalism had been aroused.

In 2016, David Cameron, the British prime minister, having won the Scottish referendum, decided to try his luck again by offering a vote on Britain’s continued membership in the European Union: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?”

The argument against continued membership in the union was made in terms of national sovereignty. It was not a new argument. When the European Union began its slow march toward a federal future in the late 1980s, Britain balked at joining the process. In Margaret Thatcher’s view, joining a federal Europe meant the end of Britain’s national independence. Britain, because of its size and importance within the European Union, was able to opt out of the foundational arrangements of this federal Europe: the Schengen Agreement, which allows free movement of people over national borders, as well as the single currency, the euro.

Fear about sovereignty did to normally pragmatic English minds what fear does to most minds: It made them irrational. During the Scottish referendum the European Union made it clear to Scots that if they voted for independence they would not be fast-tracked into the union and could not use the euro as its currency. No greater endorsement of British sovereignty could have been imagined. Didn’t matter.

When the votes were counted, 53 percent of English voters opted to leave while 62 percent of Scots voted to remain. Two very distinct expressions of national will, but only one is being acted on.

How much did Catalonia’s decision to hold an independence referendum vote owe to the Scottish vote? Did Carles Puigdemont, leader of the Catalan Parliament, make a mistake in assuming that the precedent of peaceful voting in Britain on Scottish independence meant Catalans could have their vote in a similarly respectful atmosphere?

Didn’t he know that a European Union pledge to respect the sovereignty of its existing members would not intervene when the Spanish government sent in the Guardia Civil to stop it?

The Catalan crisis leads to a final question about nationhood: Can Western Europe’s nations hope to preserve their wealth and high living standards in a globalized economy without pooling their nationhood into something greater?

The beginning of an answer to this contemporary question comes from the past. Around 500 years ago, at another time of political and economic flux, a Polish nobleman, whose name is lost to history, was asked about his national identity. He responded, “I am of the Polish nation, of the Lithuanian citizenship, of the Ruthenian people, and of Jewish origin.”

The answer anticipates the view of Albert Rivera, who leads an anti-independence center-right party in Catalonia: “Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future.”

Isabella Helen Lugoski was born in Detroit on Dec. 2, 1921, the daughter of Polish immigrants. Her father, Zygmunt Lugoski, worked for the city’s transportation system. Her mother, the former Elizabeth Graczyk, ran a restaurant — eventually with Isabella’s help.

“My mother realized fairly early that I like numbers,” Dr. Karle recalled in an interview in 2015. “I soon became the accountant, so to speak. Fresh meat was delivered every day, and the butcher left the bill that had to be paid once a week. So once a week I added up all the numbers of the money that was owed him.”

She skipped a couple of grades in elementary school. Later, she learned she would need to take a science class in high school to attend a university. By whim, she said, she chose chemistry, and the teacher, a woman, sparked her passion for the subject. (Her father was initially disappointed. He had hoped she would be a lawyer, as he had wanted to be.)

She attended Wayne University (now Wayne State University) in Detroit for a semester before obtaining a four-year scholarship to the University of Michigan, where she received her bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees, all before she turned 23.

She met her husband while an undergraduate: The spaces in the physical chemistry laboratory were assigned in alphabetical order, so Karle was seated next to Lugoski.

“I walked into the physical chemistry laboratory and there’s a young man in the desk next to mine with his apparatus all set up running his experiment,” Dr. Karle said. “I don’t think I was very polite about it. I asked him how did he get in here early and have everything all set up. He didn’t like that. So we didn’t talk to each other for a while.”

Eventually, they did talk again. They married in 1942.

Both worked in Chicago on the Manhattan Project, the government effort during World War II to develop an atomic bomb. Isabella Karle developed processes to synthesize plutonium chloride out of lumps of impure plutonium oxide.

The Karles moved to the Naval Research Laboratory after the war and stayed there until both retired on the same day in July 2009.

Mr. Joyce formally renounced his dual citizenship after the scandal began and is now eligible to run.

“The decision of the court today is clearly not the outcome we were hoping for,” Mr. Turnbull said, “but the business of government goes on.”

The issue erupted in July when Scott Ludlam, a longtime Greens party senator from Western Australia, abruptly resigned after discovering he had retained New Zealand citizenship after becoming a naturalized Australian. While his supporters lamented the loss of a leader who had made a name with his stirring speeches and stern antinuclear stance, opponents accused the party of lackadaisical vetting.

Members of Australia’s most prominent parties began contacting foreign offices and consulates. To a mix of both broad amusement and dismay, five other senators — Matt Canavan of the Liberal National Party, Malcolm Roberts of the One Nation party, Fiona Nash of the Nationals, Nick Xenophon of the Nick Xenophon Team and Larissa Waters of the Australian Greens party — were found to have citizenship of other countries. So was Mr. Joyce, the deputy prime minister and House member.

On Friday, the court ruled that only Mr. Canavan and Mr. Xenophon had been eligible to run.

As the cases wound through the courts, the local news media named the group “the Citizenship Seven.”

Their situations varied. Some were born overseas and incorrectly believed they had renounced their citizenship rights. One senator, Mr. Xenophon, said he discovered that he held a rare type of British citizenship through his father, who left Cyprus before it gained independence from Britain. Another senator, Ms. Nash, said she was unaware she had been granted British citizenship by descent through her estranged Scottish father.

Mr. Joyce said he had not known he could be a citizen of New Zealand through his father until the local news media made inquiries to its Department of Internal Affairs.

Mr. Joyce’s odds of retaining his seat were bolstered after the ruling when his most formidable rival, Tony Windsor, declined to enter the race. But Mr. Joyce is likely to face other challengers.

Tanya Plibersek, the deputy leader of the opposition Labor Party, asked why Mr. Turnbull had allowed Mr. Joyce to stay in Parliament and make decisions despite facing the prospect that he would be declared ineligible.

“It is an extraordinary lapse of judgment from the prime minister,” she said.

Clive Bean, a professor of political science at the Queensland University of Technology, said Mr. Joyce’s party would probably keep the seat.

Still, voters may behave unpredictably in by-elections, he said. “Sometimes even a safe government seat may even be at risk because voters think, ‘Well, we’re going to send a message to the government in what we’re doing.’”

While the government would lose its formal majority in the lower chamber if Mr. Joyce does not win the by-election, it still has a tiebreaking vote in the speaker of the House, Tony Smith, a Liberal ally of Mr. Turnbull.

The government’s grip can be further solidified with the backing of independent members of Parliament. One such member, Cathy McGowan, has already said she would continue to vote in support.

The by-election is not the only concern Mr. Joyce faces, said Anne Twomey, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney.

“There may be legal challenges to decisions he’s made in the past, and that might be problematic,” she said. “This is all uncharted territory.”

In the cases before the High Court, the solicitor general representing the Commonwealth, Stephen Donoghue, had argued that five of the politicians, most of whom inherited citizenship, could not have known they held foreign citizenship without expert knowledge of foreign legal systems in relation to their family roots. Once they were aware, he argued, they had made reasonable efforts to renounce foreign allegiances and thus should not be disqualified from office.

To Mr. Donoghue’s surprise, two of the politicians in the cases — Mr. Ludlam and Ms. Waters — argued that all seven should be disqualified. Both resigned their positions after their dual citizenship came to light. Mr. Xenophon also announced his resignation but for an unrelated reason: to run for the lower house of the State Parliament in South Australia.

Mr. Xenophon said that although he had won his case, he felt sympathy for his colleagues who lost.

Still, the staging gives the illusion that something dynamic and new is happening. In an odd way, Mr. Herrin’s hilarious work on the recent production of “Noises Off” at the Roundabout Theater was excellent preparation. “People, Places & Things” is a kind of inverted farce, with all the doors slamming in the other direction.

But I kept waiting for something bigger than fine stagecraft — and even Ms. Gough’s extreme, ingenious performance — to kick in. In his touching play “Every Brilliant Thing” and in the brutal adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984” he wrote with Robert Icke, Mr. Macmillan demonstrated an eagerness to keep the audience engaged in static stories at all costs, and to send it off with a big finish.

These are usually admirable instincts, and they do, for the most part, keep us from wandering as Emma goes through her recovery laps. Even during the play’s longueurs — it feels a bit padded to achieve its length — you sense that larger questions are being assembled to deliver a gut-punch reversal at the end. When it comes, you must re-evaluate what you thought you knew. But Ben Brantley was right to ask, in his New York Times review of the play’s 2015 premiere at London’s National Theater, whether that effect is “enough to make theatergoers feel that their own long, often tedious path to enlightenment has been worth it.”

His answer was no. Mine is “yes, but.” However valuable and accurate “People, Places & Things” is as a portrait of the addict’s nightmare, in and out of rehab, the play really wants to weigh in on a more fundamental issue about addiction and responsibility. And on this note it seems to waffle as much as I do in responding to it. Perhaps this is the result of a contradiction built into recovery itself, at least as structured along the 12-step model: We play a large part in our own addictions yet we are powerless over them.

Mr. Macmillan develops the argument between these two ideas in a series of confrontations with three women: the recovery center’s doctor; its therapist; and, eventually, Emma’s mother. (It is thematically useful that all are played by Barbara Marten, who is brisk as the doctor, warm as the therapist and jaw dropping as the mother.) The first two women, as advocates for a process that is fundamentally structured around acceptance of a higher power, locate the source of addiction in a breach of humility: Addiction, the doctor suggests, is caused by trauma we flatter ourselves to think we can ignore or control.

Emma furiously rejects this interpretation, in ways that many an atheist and Foucaultian will recognize. “If it’s vital to my recovery that I come to believe in a power greater than me,” Emma fulminates, “then we might all just be wasting our time.” It is, she points out, the 21st century.

And though the doctor explains that her clinic employs a “religiously neutral” modification of the 12-step template — one in which addicts express powerlessness over the three nouns that make up the play’s title — she nevertheless (Emma notices witheringly) wears a crucifix. Further, the play is all too successful in replicating the sententiousness and sanctimony of recovery jargon, at least as overheard by an outsider.

So which is it? Is recovery (as Emma first sees it) a cult of ego deflation or (as she later sees it) a spiritual and medical response to trauma? It may be reasonable to suggest that, as she recovers, her position gradually changes, her punctured actorly narcissism fizzling with a long hiss. She leaves rehab a convert to its philosophy of personal responsibility. But then, as the play closes — I won’t spoil how — we are given devastating evidence that Emma’s addiction is not her fault at all, but rather the mark of the world’s cruelty to sensitive souls.

Are we not then all addicts? Or is the play simply addicted to its own effects?

If I was troubled by Mr. Macmillan’s philosophical opportunism — the story sometimes works like a toggle switch, flipped this way and that to maintain suspense — perhaps it’s because I am leery of a mechanistic approach to “issue drama.” And to recovery. Yet it is not the playwright’s job to provide answers to such questions. It is enough that he leaves you scraping the insides of your soul, looking for your own.","Review: The Horror Show of Rehab in ‘People, Places & Things’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/theater/people-places-things-review.html

Indeed, as much as I hate Flake’s politics, I suspect there’s a connection between his intense political commitments and his bravery. Not long ago, I spoke to Eyal Press, the author of “Beautiful Souls: The Courage and Conscience of Ordinary People in Extraordinary Times,” a book about those who resist immoral authorities and institutions. We tend, Press told me, to “think of these people as iconoclasts, or imagine that they are somehow people with a kind of oppositional spirit,” but in fact, most of them are true believers in the purported ideals of their organizations. It’s because they value those ideals so highly, he said, that they’re moved to break ranks when they see them tarnished.

To recognize the role of Flake’s conservative principles in fueling his dissent is not to absolve the conservative movement for Trump. For decades, Republicans have stoked the culture war to win the support of people hurt by their economic policies. Under the guise of pushing back against left-wing bias, the right has systematically tried to discredit all objective sources of information, ushering in a berserk reactionary postmodernism in which truth loses its meaning. And though the Republican Party’s racial appeals used to be more coded, it’s been capitalizing on white resentment for a long time.

All the same, Trump is not just a vulgar version of a normal conservative. His authoritarianism threatens libertarian ideals as well as progressive ones, he’s personally repugnant in ways that transcend politics, and his incompetence endangers us all. There’s no contradiction between abhorring conservatism and being grateful to the conservatives who stand up to Trump.

Some who’ve criticized Flake have said that, rather than quitting, he should defend his principles in a primary fight. Maybe, but even the strongest-minded people can’t avoid tailoring their words and actions to suit the exigencies of political campaigns. The need to be re-elected can too easily become an excuse not to act.

Talking to a Republican Trump critic recently, I asked, as I often do, how his Republican friends in Congress live with themselves. He said some justify their silence by saying that if they speak out, they could be replaced by Trumpist lunatics. They’re not wrong, but they’re also offering up a common rationale for perpetual acquiescence. As Masha Gessen wrote right after the election, those who collaborate with authoritarianism often insist that they’re trying to ameliorate its excesses. There are always reasons not to speak up for what’s right.

Now that they’ve spoken, the next step for Flake, Corker, Senator John McCain and other Republicans who hope to be remembered kindly by history is to act. Corker, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could hold hearings into how Trump has already eroded America’s position worldwide.

Both Corker and Flake should be willing to support legislation protecting the investigation of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Trump’s ties to Russia. They should also back legislation to curb the president’s ability to launch nuclear weapons unilaterally, and leave the door open to supporting impeachment.

In his speech, Flake promised to use his remaining 14 months in office standing up and speaking out “as if our country depends on it.” If he fails to do that, he’ll deserve progressive dismissals.

It’s two miles to the east of London’s “Theaterland” but it is a world away from the cramped facilities of the West End’s Victorian venues, with their restrictive proscenium arch layouts. The Bridge’s auditorium is fully flexible. The stage for “Young Marx” extends into the audience; the audience sits on three sides, with seats raked over four tiers. Yet the space feels remarkably intimate, and even the cheap seats — costing under $20 — have decent sightlines.

Critics, lukewarm about the play but effusive about the venue, have been quick to point out the irony of opening London’s first wholly new, large-scale commercial theater in 80 years with a play about an critic of capitalism. Yet the theater is attempting to, well, bridge the usual approaches of the commercial and subsidized sectors in the UK.

For starters, it’s largely dedicated to new writing — a notoriously tricky sell at the box office. Few untested plays open in the West End. New writing can also suffer from a reputation for dry worthiness, a notion Mr. Hytner aims to dispel.

“New writing doesn’t have to be a ghettoized, virtuous thing,” he said. “These are new shows that aim to communicate widely. And if we’re ever going to find a ‘Curious Incident’ or ‘The History Boys,’ they’re going to be new things.”

Mr. Hytner also insisted that there is a big audience out there. “They flock to the shows they want to see,” he said. “A lot of them musicals, quite a lot of them not.”

Indeed, a raft of plays have transferred from subsidized theaters to the West End in recent years — including new writing from venues such as the Almeida (“Ink”; “King Charles III”) and the Royal Court (“The Ferryman”; “Hangmen”) as well as the National.

“New writing is always risky, but the work has been so good, audiences are more receptive now,” said Nica Burns, a West End producer who credits the increasing collaboration between subsidized and commercial theaters. “This is why we have such a healthy theater, with so many plays in the West End compared to Broadway.”

The Bridge’s investors seem convinced that if an appetite for bold new plays has been nourished by thriving government-funded theaters and a culture of transfers, they can be originated in a commercial venue in the first place. The £12 million, or about $16 million, construction costs were raised upfront from venture capitalists.

But the model is based on the two Nicks’ experience running a building, and they’re deliberately swerving away from the more usual path of renting a theater.

“A West End producer puts up all the money, takes all the risk, and because there are so many fighting for relatively few theaters, they have to take the terms you’d expect,” Mr. Hytner said. He added that they don’t get the revenue from “the bars, the programs, the ice creams. I know from the National that the profit margin on ice-cream is something you want to keep!”

Owning the Bridge means Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr have the opportunity to rake those retail profits in. But crucially, it also means they’ll avoid the particular pressure of budgeting on a show-by-show basis.

“We don’t have to show a return on every single play,” Mr. Hytner said. “It’s a cash-flow business. That graph can go up and down quite considerably, but if we play at over 75 percent we’re doing brilliantly. That’s not even really a target because if, say, ‘Julius Caesar’ plays to 95 percent it doesn’t really matter what the plays either side of it do.”

Such long-view financial flexibility will allow Mr. Hytner and Mr. Starr to program the work they like: “theater which is ambitious,” as Mr. Hytner defines it. And there’s surely another lesson from the subsidized sector: To be ambitious, you have to be able to afford to fail sometimes.

Mr. Hytner is evidently relieved to have shrugged off the burden of overseeing a national institution, however. “Everybody knows what a National Theater should be, what the repertoire should be,” he said. “The fact is that everyone, of course, knows differently.” Now, he is free to do as he pleases — just so long as what pleases him pleases the audience.",A New London Theater Aims to Stage a Revolution,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/theater/bridge-theater-london-nicholas-hytner-young-marx.html

It has prompted increasingly frustrated members of Congress to demand answers for how a shadowy mission in an austere region of Africa left four Americans and five Nigeriens dead, including the interpreter.

The questions — including the mission’s shifting goals, the intelligence assessment to back it up, how the soldiers were separated and the frantic search for Sergeant Johnson’s body — were at the forefront on Thursday when senior military officers and their civilian Pentagon bosses traveled to Capitol Hill to give separate two-hour classified briefings for members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who heads the Senate panel and who has criticized the Defense Department for failing to provide lawmakers details of the ambush, praised the briefing without divulging details. But he emphasized that he still had “100 questions” that the officials could not yet answer.

Pentagon officials said they would need 30 days to wrap up their inquiry, Mr. McCain said. Other senators on the committee said it could take up to 60 days. Army Maj. Gen. Roger L. Cloutier Jr., the chief of staff of the military’s Africa Command in Germany, is leading the inquiry.

“It’s clearer, but there’s still a lot of things that they don’t know,” said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. “Why did it take 48 hours to find Sergeant Johnson? We don’t know that yet.”

Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said many lawmakers were surprised to learn the scope of American military missions in Africa and, in particular, the size of the military presence in Niger, where 800 United States troops conduct training missions and drone operations. “I don’t think Congress has been completely kept up to date,” Mr. Kaine said.

The mystery of what happened that day only deepened as new details emerged from interviews with more than a half dozen military officers, Pentagon officials and lawmakers this week.

On the night of Oct. 3, two groups set off in rural southwest Niger. One was a team of American, French and Nigerien commandos on a clandestine operation to kill or capture an Islamic State operative, part of a broader mission code-named Obsidian Nomad. The other group — made up of about eight Army Special Forces, three American soldiers in support roles and their interpreter, along with 30 Nigerien troops — was on a separate reconnaissance patrol. At some later point, the team was asked to back up the first group if needed.

Bad weather scotched the raid, intended to be launched from helicopters. But the second group remained in the region, after being asked by commanders to search further for evidence of the Islamic State jihadist, code-named Naylor Road by the military.

On the morning of Oct. 4, the team swung through the village of Tongo Tongo to resupply and met with local elders out of courtesy. Villagers might have tipped off Islamic State militants in the area, Nigerien and American military officials have said. One military official, however, said on Thursday that a villager told the troops that an important Islamic State emir was in the area, possibly alerting them that the extremists were approaching.

Shortly after the American soldiers, who were led by an Army captain, and the Nigerien troops left the village, heading back to base about two hours away, some 50 Islamic State militants armed with machine guns and heavy weapons ambushed the group at about 11:40 a.m. local time.

Lightly armed with no heavy weapons of their own, the American and Nigerien forces tried to defend themselves. Outgunned and taking casualties, the soldiers tried to stand their ground until additional Nigerien troops rushed to the scene.

It was not clear when the Nigeriens, along with French troops, arrived, but American officials indicated that they had made it to the ambush site by the time the seven Americans were evacuated.

When troops from the elite Joint Special Operations Command were alerted to the situation, however, they were told that several Americans were missing. That calls into question Pentagon officials’ earlier assertions that either the Nigerien forces or French helicopters were with the bodies of at least three of the soldiers until they were recovered — an insistence that underscores the mantra that no soldier is left behind.

“The U.S. military does not leave our troops behind,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week.

Eventually, the team of American commandos originally scheduled to target the Islamic State militant the previous night were dropped near the ambush site and found the bodies of three of their comrades: Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright.

But at least one American was still missing. Commandos from Sigonella, Italy, and Djibouti rushed to Niger’s capital, Niamey, while a reserve unit of Special Forces stationed at Africa Command headquarters in Germany prepared to deploy if needed. Sergeant Johnson’s body was found by Nigeriens on the evening of Oct. 6.

After the ambush, American units in the region were forced to change radio frequencies because communications equipment was missing and believed compromised by enemy forces.

The American-backed operations to topple the Islamic State from its strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, could increase the risks in Africa, if Islamic State fighters flee to the continent to continue their mayhem there, as some have begun to do.

“The more we succeed in the Middle East, the more we’re going to see the snakes run to Africa,” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said on Thursday. “We’ve got to be prepared to advise and assist the nations there that are willing to work with us.”

Some lawmakers, including Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called for hearings to help explain what went wrong in Niger.

“I need to be able to look families in the eye and explain what our mission is, what mistakes were made in this incident, who made them and why,” Mr. Blumenthal said.","U.S. Soldiers Were Separated From Unit in Niger Ambush, Officials Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/africa/niger-soldiers-killed-ambush.html

The three-day excursion, arranged by E-World Travel & Tours, began in Manhattan with a stop planned in Niagara Falls. The tour was meant to head on to Washington and then to Philadelphia, but the bus broke down in upstate New York, forcing the passengers to wait for hours at a shopping mall until a replacement, a 1996 Setra, showed up.

The whirlwind nature of the trip was magnified by the tight schedule set by E-World and the breakneck pace kept by the Setra’s driver, Jinli Zhao, whose erratic driving had unnerved many passengers.

Mr. Zhao seemed irritated, angry, even rude, often rushing the passengers at rest stops, some of them later reported. At least once when a passenger returned late to the bus, Mr. Zhao began to drive away, as though he meant to leave them, one passenger told the police.

Mr. Zhao also seemed distracted behind the wheel. He would eat while driving, passengers recalled. He argued frequently with the tour guide and constantly downed energy drinks. And he was frequently on his cellphone, they said.

He veered near cars in adjacent lanes, accelerated dangerously and then stepped on the brakes, passengers said, cutting off other vehicles. He shifted lanes at such high speed that one passenger said he felt the bus swaying back and forth.

The tour guide, Allan Ge, told the passengers that Mr. Zhao had not slept in a while, Melis Seker, a Turkish college student who was then 19, later told the police. Mr. Ge told the group that “if the police ever stopped the bus and found that the driver had not had enough sleep, then they would be forced to stay and rest,” Ms. Seker said.

The crash occurred on a stretch of roadway in Delaware that investigators said the driver was unfamiliar with. Confronted with traffic on Interstate 95, he and Mr. Ge decided to take a different route. Mr. Zhao consulted his GPS and turned onto a long, curving off-ramp leading from State Route 1 toward U.S. Route 13.

As they pulled onto the ramp, several people stood up and shouted for the driver to slow down, one passenger told the police. When the bus began to tip, luggage tumbled from the overhead racks. People started screaming.

An Algerian man, Karim Fellahi, who was with his wife, Ihssene Kerchouche, on their honeymoon, remembered seeing the driver lose control.

“I just had the time to say to Ihssene, ‘Be ready for the impact,’” Mr. Fellahi, 36, testified, “because we were sure that we are going to die. We closed our eyes and we waited to die.”

The bus was off the road now, careening into a sloping area of bushes. It went upside-down, turned on its roof and skidded partway down a grassy embankment, rolling again and landing with a shudder on the driver’s side.

Moments later, Mr. Fellahi said, he opened his eyes to a barely identifiable structure. “I couldn’t recognize the roof,” he said. Ms. Kerchouche, 29, had disappeared; even her seat was gone.

“I heard her screaming my name,” Mr. Fellahi said. “It was like she was far, very far, from me.”

He found his wife outside the bus, facedown in the dirt and covered by other passengers. Her mangled right forearm was dangling, connected to the rest of her arm by a piece of skin.

Another passenger testified that she and her sister were propelled through the air at the moment of the crash, flying forward and slamming into people and broken bus parts.

She could not move her arms or legs and felt an unbearable pain in her pelvis, which had been fractured by a large piece of metal.

The Delaware State Police arrived to a scene of carnage: a twisted metal shell and dozens of bodies strewn around it. A 400-foot-long trail of tire marks streaked across the road.

As passengers struggled to escape, Eyup Bahsi, a 30-year-old Turkish man, looked in vain for his wife, Idil. Also 30, she had been sitting in the window seat beside him. Mr. Bahsi finally found her, conscious and seated with her legs pinned underneath the bus. She was trying to pull herself free.

Ms. Bahsi was also having trouble breathing, Mr. Bahsi said, and he gently helped her lie on her back. He tried to clear her mouth of dirt.

She squeezed his hand, opened and closed her eyes and tried to speak, but Mr. Bahsi said that he could not make out the words. He sought to reassure his wife, telling her to just stay calm, that an ambulance was on its way. Ms. Bahsi eventually reached a hospital, where she underwent several operations. She died later that night.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the crash was excessive speed. Mr. Zhao, the driver, claimed that he was feeling ill before the crash and had “blacked out.” But the safety board said that the evidence suggested he was not incapacitated.

The board eventually determined that Mr. Zhao had driven a total of 14¾ hours that Saturday, exceeding the 10-hour federal limit. He also did not have the requisite eight hours off before he set out on the road again.

The board found that the driver’s cellphone records showed he was routinely making and receiving calls and was using his voice mail when the bus was moving, although not when it crashed.

Mr. Zhao, 56, later pleaded guilty to three counts of operating a vehicle causing death and received probation, Delaware court records show.

This month, when a reporter visited his apartment in Queens, Mr. Zhao loomed silently in the background as a young man, who did not give his name but said he was Mr. Zhao’s son, stood in the doorway. He said his father was so “scarred” by the crash that he hardly spoke of it, even to his family.

“What’s past is past,” the son added.

During the litigation, Mr. Zhao was deposed by victims’ lawyers. He testified that when he arrived from New York to fetch the tour group in the Setra, he informed the guide, Mr. Ge, that he was already “very tired.” Mr. Zhao said he had explained to Mr. Ge that if they kept to their plan, his hours would be “a lot over the limit.” He said that Mr. Ge responded there was “nothing he could do.”

In an interview, Mr. Ge said that he did not recall Mr. Zhao looking “really tired.” An E-World supervisor, David Lo, described the travel agency as “an innocent victim” in the crash. “We cannot control the driver,” Mr. Lo said. “We cannot control the bus company.”

The bus was insured for $5 million — the minimum required by law. The insurers filed court papers saying they anticipated that the claims from the crash would exceed their policies, and they ultimately deposited the full $5 million with the court and left Judge Brown to allocate it.

Lawyers for the victims said that this approach, while hardly ideal, was nonetheless their best chance to compensate their clients. The lawyers had learned that AM USA Express had sold its remaining three buses and gone out of business; E-World, they said, also had few assets.

The process was designed to avoid a lengthy court fight, but because the pool of money was limited, it meant that if some passengers got more, others would get less. “On a certain level, it’s a zero-sum game,” said Brian M. Levy, a lawyer for 21 of the claimants.

In order to understand the impact of the crash, Judge Brown held two days of investigative hearings in April. What had previously been a dry legal matter suddenly became excruciatingly human.

Around 10:30 a.m. on April 26, several of the victims — some having traveled from continents away — filed into the courtroom in Central Islip, N.Y. Judge Brown had set out boxes of tissues, and as the day went on, he stopped the proceedings several times to apologize.

“I understand this was a horrific event,” he said, “and we’re going to do everything we can to get you through this as painlessly as possible.”

The first witness was Shilpa Lagishetty, who told the judge that she had suffered a traumatic injury to her right eye socket. Even after surgery, Ms. Lagishetty said, she had constant headaches and could no longer see things that were more than two feet away.

There had also been an emotional toll. “I still have sleepless nights,” she said. On the morning of the crash, she recounted, a woman had asked her to swap seats; she did. The woman died in the crash, she said, beginning to cry.

“I’m so depressed,” she added. “That lady had a son. I can’t imagine me in that position.”

Addressing the judge next was Mr. Bahsi, who had flown to New York from Turkey. He spoke through an interpreter, recounting how his wife had been trapped beneath the bus and died that night in the hospital.

“She was my everything,” he said, “and she was my best friend and she was my best companion.” He added: “It’s difficult. It’s — you know, to come as two individuals and to go back basically with a coffin.”

The next to testify were the Algerian honeymooners, Ms. Kerchouche and Mr. Fellahi. After the crash, Ms. Kerchouche had numerous surgeries as doctors struggled to repair her right arm, which had suffered extensive nerve and vascular damage, and her other injuries. She ultimately faced several hundred thousand dollars in medical bills. Unable to travel, she and Mr. Fellahi had to stay in the United States for more than four months as she recovered. Ms. Kerchouche, who worked for a bank, could not return to work.

Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy. But she could not hold her child, she testified, because one of her arms was permanently locked at a 90-degree angle. Nor could she write, drive a car or turn a door handle, she said. In time, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic-stress disorder.

“She’s like living, but dead in the same time,” her husband told the judge.

Ms. Seker, the Turkish college student, was unable to come to court, but she sent a letter to her lawyer, Jordan K. Merson, who read it to the judge. In the letter, Ms. Seker said the crash’s impact on her life had been endless. She was in constant pain — the crash broke both of her shoulders and some of her ribs, and she was left with a collapsed lung and other fractures. She had nightmares and was now afraid to sleep.

“Sometimes,” she wrote, “I wake up and feel like I am being thrown, like I was on the bus.”

In a recent interview, Ms. Seker said that before the crash, she had been training to be a competitive swimmer and also loved playing volleyball. Now she cannot engage in either sport.

“They said probably I will never be able to do them again,” she said. Like Ms. Kerchouche, she had also stayed in the United States for more than a month to recover, in her case forcing her to miss a semester of school.

In the courtroom, Judge Brown appeared perplexed by the challenge of comparing these cases.

“How do I do this?” he asked Ms. Seker’s lawyer, Mr. Merson. The judge cited Ms. Kerchouche’s case, mentioning her damaged arm. “She can’t hold her baby,” he said. “She can’t feel anything.”",‘Everyone Lost Something’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/bus-crash-underinsured-victims-compensation.html

Tiger Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving on Friday and will be put on probation for a year and attend a rehabilitation program.

Woods, 41, made the plea in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.

Woods was found by a police officer asleep at the wheel of his parked Mercedes in May. Woods had “extremely slow and slurred speech,” a police report said. He was “sluggish, sleepy and unable to walk alone.”

Woods struggled with sobriety tests at the scene and was later found to have five drugs in his system, including Vicodin, Xanax and Ambien, but no alcohol.

He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly.
He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.
“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

The profound equality of every individual was an idea that flowed directly from the Hebrew Bible. The story Americans told about themselves was a biblical story — an exodus story of various diverse peoples leaving oppression, crossing a wilderness and joining together to help create a promised land.

The American social structure, as Sacks notes, was based on biblical categories. There was a political realm, but the heart of society was in the covenantal realm: “marriages, families, congregations, communities, charities and voluntary associations.”

America’s Judeo-Christian ethic celebrated neighborliness over pagan combativeness; humility as the basis of good character, not narcissism. It believed in taking in the stranger because we were all strangers once. It dreamed of universal democracy as the global fulfillment of the providential plan.

That biblical ethic, embraced by atheists as much as the faithful, is not in great shape these days. As Sacks notes: “Today, one half of America is losing all those covenantal institutions. It’s losing strong marriages and families and communities. It is losing a strong sense of the American narrative. It’s even losing e pluribus unum because today everyone prefers pluribus to unum.…”

Trump and Bannon have filled the void with their own creed, which is anti-biblical. The American story they tell is not diverse people journeying toward a united future. It’s a zero-sum struggle of class and ethnic conflict. The traits Trump embodies are narcissism, not humility; combativeness, not love; the sanctification of the rich and blindness toward the poor.

As other relationships wither, many Americans are making partisanship the basis of their identity — their main political, ethnic and moral attachment. And the polls show that if you want to win a Republican primary these days, you have to embrace the Trump narrative, and not the old biblical one.

The Republican senators went to the White House and saw a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s. But they know which way the wind is blowing. They gave him a standing ovation.

Even Alexander Kerensky didn’t abase himself so humiliatingly.

The people who oppose Trump make a big error: “Let’s Get Togetherism.” This is the belief that if we can only have a civil conversation between red and blue, then everything will be better. But you can’t destroy a moral vision with a process. You need a counter-moral vision.

The people who reluctantly collaborate with Trump make a different error: economism. This is the belief that Trump’s behavior is tolerable because at least Republicans can pass a tax cut. People who believe that value money more than morals. Trumpism is not just economic, and it can’t be thwarted by passing a bit of economic policy.

This is like 1917, a clash of political, moral, economic and social ideologies all rolled into one.

Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years.
Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about 1 million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections.
Those junior workers would mark inspection certificates using the name stamps of qualified supervisors, Subaru said.
“Rules are rules.”","“I’m distressed that our company is responsible for something that could cast doubt on the quality of Japanese manufacturing,” Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, chief executive of Subaru Corporation, said at a news conference on Friday. “This will be reported around the world.”

The inspection problem involves final quality checks that automakers perform on vehicles before they leave factories for dealerships.

After a car rolls off an assembly line, workers look it over and run it on rollers to ensure it is in working order. Points on their checklists include: Do the seats adjust properly? Do the headlights shine at the correct angle? Does the speedometer work accurately?

Such checks are a standard part of automobile manufacturing. But in Japan, the law requires that carmakers produce a special certificate for every vehicle to show it has passed examination; only then can it be registered as road worthy.

Government guidelines specify that workers who conduct these inspections must be “qualified” — though the authorities leave the details up to manufacturers. The car companies have the responsibility of deciding what training is required and of authorizing employees to work as qualified inspectors.

Nissan and Subaru stumbled on that step. They allowed some workers who had not completed training programs or who had not been formally authorized to be “final inspectors” to perform the checks.

The corner-cutting appears to have been long-established. Subaru said company rules designating who was allowed to inspect cars had been inconsistent with government guidelines for 30 years. Nissan says it is still investigating the scope and duration of its failure, but several news reports have suggested that it too may have been using unqualified inspectors for decades.

Independent specialists say it is unlikely that the inspection practices resulted in unsafe cars.

Automotive manufacturers and their suppliers perform multiple safety tests during development and production, and serious but hard-to-find faults — say, unstable chemicals inside an airbag inflater, which are believed to have caused the Takata hazard — are unlikely to be spotted by a limited, mostly external once-over.

Some commentators have suggested that part of the blame belongs with Japanese regulators, whose guidelines regarding inspectors appear simultaneously burdensome and vague. Cars made for export are not subject to the same rules, because governments outside Japan do not require final vehicle inspections to be carried out by workers with special training and qualifications.

“The checks are a formality, and it would not be an exaggeration to say they require no special know-how,” Hisao Inoue, a veteran Japanese automotive journalist, wrote on the website of the magazine Gendai Business after the initial admission by Nissan.

He said the inspection regulations should be reviewed, though he added that it was “absolutely wrong” for Nissan to have broken the rules.

Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry study firm, said Nissan and Subaru had risked their reputations and shown a disregard for following the rules, but had probably not endangered their customers.

“It makes you question how well they are managing what’s happening on the factory floor,” Mr. Tsukuda said. “Even if there is not a safety problem, users of their products will feel uneasy.”

Mr. Tsukuda said a shrinking car market in Japan may have increased the temptation to cheat. The country’s automakers are selling more and more vehicles abroad, as demand at home declines because of Japan’s falling population. Nissan, for instance — a particularly foreign-focused producer — sells 90 percent of its cars outside Japan.

That increases the cost, relative to sales, of complying with domestic-only rules — in this case by putting workers through special courses to become authorized inspectors, a process that can take them away from their normal duties over a period of weeks or even months.

“The Japan market is becoming an afterthought,” Mr. Tsukuda said.

The carmakers’ crisis management capabilities are now being tested.

In particular, critics have complained that Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, failed to show sufficient contrition at a news conference about the company’s lapse. In a country where apologies are highly ritualized, even his bow — briefer and shallower than those of most executives seeking the public’s forgiveness — became a target of criticism.

Subaru, which is one of Japan’s smaller carmakers, with production of about 1 million vehicles a year, said that 245 workers in Japan were authorized to conduct final vehicle inspections. It said a much smaller group of employees — between four and 17 at any given time — who were studying to be inspectors but had not yet qualified, would also certify vehicles, contrary to government guidelines.

Representatives for CVS and Aetna declined to comment. News of the possible transaction, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sent Aetna shares soaring nearly 12 percent Thursday, while CVS’s stock dropped 3 percent.

CVS, which reported revenue of $177.5 billion for 2016, is based in Rhode Island and opened its first store in 1963. It became a billion-dollar company in 1985.

Although it is best known for its chain of storefront pharmacies, it is also one of the nation’s top three pharmacy benefit managers and operates one of the country’s biggest specialty pharmacies, which sells high-priced drugs that often require special handling. The company also runs walk-in MinuteClinics in its pharmacies and Target stores around the country.

CVS has managed Aetna’s pharmacy benefits since 2010, and it announced a deal last week with Anthem, a large insurer, to help it start the insurer’s own pharmacy benefit business. It is unclear how the Aetna deal would affect CVS’s future relationship with Anthem, and an Anthem spokeswoman declined to comment.

Mr. Fein said the acquisition of Aetna, if it went through, would mark an industry shift toward a more seamless approach to managing health care costs. Right now, insurers are typically responsible for managing a patient’s medical bills and outsource the coverage of prescription drugs to a pharmacy benefit manager like CVS. Mr. Fein said that because the fastest-growing part of the pharmacy industry was high-priced specialty drugs for people who have considerable medical needs, “it makes sense to manage those within one coordinated organization.”

“It’s a strategic play,” agreed Paul Keckley, a longtime industry consultant, who said CVS’s goal was not necessarily to be in the insurance business but to offer the ability to manage both medical and pharmacy costs for large employers. In addition to its insurance business, Aetna has partnerships with numerous large health systems and a sophisticated technology operation.

The resulting company could resemble UnitedHealth Group, which has a large insurance operation but also runs a leading pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, and related health service businesses.

The deal would end Aetna’s own ambitions to be a much bigger company. Its proposed $37 billion merger with Humana, another large insurer, was blocked by the Department of Justice and was called off this year.

Also, to the extent that the story makes any sense at all, it’s a story about the very long run.

Oh, and the stronger dollar would also mean much bigger trade deficits — a consequence of tax cuts that Republicans, strange to say, haven’t advertised, even though the same thing happened during the Reagan years.

Realistically, then, the benefits from cutting corporate taxes would overwhelmingly flow into after-tax profits rather than wages, especially in the first few years and probably for a decade or more. And this in turn means that the main beneficiaries would be stockholders, not workers.

So who are these stockholders, exactly? You can guess part of the answer: We’re talking mainly about the very affluent. Even if we count indirect holdings in retirement accounts and mutual funds, the richest 10 percent of U.S. residents account for about 80 percent of American-owned stocks, and the richest 1 percent own about 40 percent. So we’re talking, as always when it comes to Republican plans, about tax cuts heavily tilted toward the wealthy.

But that’s not the whole story, either — it gets worse.

The whole sales pitch for the Trump tax plan rests on the claim that everything is different because we’re now part of a global financial market. The truth is that this makes less difference than many imagine.

But one thing is true: These days there’s a lot of cross-border investment. In particular, as Steven M. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center notes — in a paper I found revelatory — around 35 percent of U.S. equities are now owned by foreigners, triple the level during the Reagan years.

What this means is that around 35 percent of a tax cut from an administration that proudly uses the slogan “America first” — $700 billion over the next decade — wouldn’t even go to Americans. Instead, it would be a windfall to wealthy foreigners, who would probably gain a lot more from the tax cut than U.S. workers. Oh, and it makes all that talk about allies not paying their “fair share” sound kind of silly, doesn’t it?

And meanwhile, the result would be a huge hole in the budget, which Republicans would try to close at the expense of the poor and middle class. The budget resolution the House and Senate passed over the last week called for cuts of $1 trillion in Medicaid and almost half a trillion in Medicare. The resolution doesn’t have the force of law, but it’s a pretty clear indication of what’s next if the big tax cuts pass.

Pine Island glacier

Glaciers are essentially long rivers of ice. Just as a river collects water that drains from a specific area, Antarctica’s glaciers collect ice from parts of the great ice sheets that cover the continent. The amount of ice that could flow into the Pine Island glacier and then into the sea would eventually raise the world’s sea level by over a foot and a half.

The animation above shows Pine Island glacier flowing into the Amundsen Sea from 2014 to 2017. Twice in that period, the glacier released an iceberg larger than 100 square miles.

The Pine Island’s flow is accelerating rapidly. Its ice shelf, an expanse of ice that floats on water where the glacier meets the sea, has increased its speed by 75 percent from 1973 to 2010.

“This is a result of the warmer waters in front of them,” said Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine, who has done extensive research on polar ice.

“In some relatively colder years, we know the melt rate slowed down and the glaciers slowed down. On warm ocean years, the glacier moves really fast.”

In the 1980s, Pine Island gained about as much ice as it lost every year. Now, the glacier is out of balance.

Thwaites glacier

About 100 miles southwest of Pine Island, Thwaites glacier is also shedding more and more ice into the ocean.

The amount of ice that could flow into it and then into the sea would increase global sea level by more than two feet.

Source: Copernicus Sentinel-1 | French National Center for Scientific Research

Because Thwaites is about 75 miles wide and isn’t confined to a valley the way Pine Island is, there is potential for much larger releases of ice if the glacier’s flow continues to speed up.

“These two glaciers could easily flow two to three times faster — that’s what the models show,” Dr. Rignot said. “If Pine Island’s shelf were to break up, the glacier would respond by speeding up two to three times.”

Thwaites glacier also veered from equilibrium in the late 1980s, but hasn’t been shedding as much ice as Pine Island.

This year’s ice calving events at Pine Island and Thwaites have not caused significant changes in the region, because the shifts have been in areas that did not provide critical support to the glaciers.

The movement of the ice, however, offers scientists a window into how Antarctic ice shelves might respond to rapid changes and how a runaway disintegration of the hundreds of Antarctic glaciers might look.","In Antarctica, Two Crucial Glaciers Accelerate Toward the Sea",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/26/climate/antarctica-glaciers-melt.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

MANY OF US, let’s admit it, have gone to a museum or ordered dessert simply to post the experience on social media. Likewise, many interiors on Instagram seem to have been created with a future photo in mind. But these spaces frequently feel inert, overly composed; there is none of the sense of life, of organic coherence, that accrues over time in a place that’s actually been inhabited, not just arranged for a picture. Nuriev’s apartment is certainly photogenic — he has a knack for dividing spaces with color-blocking, essentially creating areas made to be framed — but it also radiates an air of imperfect coziness. That human touch is evident in the black plastic hand-shaped chair he found on the street, or the bowl of McIntosh apples that sits on his desk because their scent reminds him of growing up in Stavropol, an agricultural hub in the Caucasus. Even as his apartment serves as his showroom — “it’s not like a website where you go and see pictures,” he says. “It’s honest.”

For Nuriev, honesty — that intangible virtue — is fundamental to good design. “This sofa,” he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, “it’s pure function, but it’s still beautiful.” His goal when designing a room, he says, is to “leave only what’s only useful.” He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a “machine for living.” These are often the references for Nuriev’s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don’t always realize it. “So many people are riffing on things they don’t know about,” says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev’s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. “Harry’s not like that. He knows exactly what he’s referencing.”

This style, in part, follows last decade’s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It’s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they’ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg’s apartment. And then there’s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don’t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.

Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because “it was very classic — Roman, Italian, Greek,” and he wanted to figure out how to “use it in real life, to make it sexy.” He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, “it looked weird.” The pink, likewise, “looked girlish,” and people would ask him why he was using it. “It’s not that everybody copied me,” he says. “It’s just that I sensed something.”

What’s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev’s Russian upbringing, but they’re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls “the Patti Smith of Russia.” Above the sofa, he’s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood’s Russian Orthodox Church: “In Russia,” he says, “it’s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.” His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.",The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/design/harry-nuriev.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle. Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macy’s department store downtown — a move rich in irony, given how Macy’s has struggled in competing with online retailers — and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the city’s downtown area.

The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon. The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle don’t use motorized transport to get to work. Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation. Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work.

Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office. The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.) It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers.

In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada.

The Alliance for Biking and Walking has ranked American cities based on the percentage of people who walk or ride bikes to work. In order, they are Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Ore., New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Chicago and Baltimore.

Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the company’s DNA.

New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington already have vibrant urban centers, not that they couldn’t be improved. They are also the kinds of places where local opposition to Amazon’s potential arrival would be more likely, based on factors like the impact on their already congested streets and criticism of the company’s workplace practices.

Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message.

“Amazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region,” he said. “That’s easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco. It’s much different than just tapping the talent that’s already there. Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that.”

Next on Amazon’s wish list are capital and operating costs” and “incentives,” which Amazon identifies as “high priority” considerations. That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “Amazon’s first obligation is to its investors,” Professor Elson said, which means finding “the most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters,” one that “will produce the most value for the company.”

Most contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark. Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so.

The accounting and consulting firm KPMG ranks major cities by costs in its biennial “Competitive Alternatives” survey. A score of 100 is equal to the United States baseline, so costs in a city with a score of 105 are 5 percent higher than the baseline; cities with a score of 95 are 5 percent lower.

New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots. (Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.) Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut. Washington’s score is 99.4.

The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austin’s score is 96.2. But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline. Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreal’s score is 85.2; Toronto’s is 85.6. Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies.

“Labor Force” is third on Amazon’s list. The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattle’s talent pool.

The commercial real estate firm CBRE produces an annual ranking of cities based on what it calls “tech talent,” which considers factors like technology positions as a percentage of all jobs, growth in tech jobs and tech-degree completion.

The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York — no surprises there. But other cities also fare well: Washington is No. 4, Toronto is No. 6, Boston is No. 9 and Baltimore is No. 11.

Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders.

Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive. Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants. Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there. Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact.

Amazon adds that “a strong university system is required.”

Many contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology. Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University.

Amazon cites logistics as “critically important,” specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco. (These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)

Virtually every major American airport could use an upgrade, but most big cities have international airports with many direct flights to the cities where Amazon does business. Pittsburgh lacks nonstop flights to Seattle and offers only limited nonstop service to international destinations. But the city was once a major hub for US Air, which made substantial investments in infrastructure there before it was taken over by American Airlines. The number of flights to and from Pittsburgh has dwindled since then, but they could easily be revived.

In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak’s northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.

“Community cultural fit” and “community quality of life” are last on Amazon’s list of preferences. Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions “a diverse population” and, again, “excellent institutions of higher education.” If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit.

Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives.

That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force. Given Amazon’s vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina’s widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights.

For Nuriev, honesty — that intangible virtue — is fundamental to good design. “This sofa,” he continues, pointing to the blue sectional, which is easy to imagine as the site of drunken late-night hangouts, “it’s pure function, but it’s still beautiful.” His goal when designing a room, he says, is to “leave only what’s only useful.” He cites as his influences Japanese architecture (especially Tadao Ando and the firm Sanaa), Scandinavian design and Le Corbusier, who famously called a house a “machine for living.” These are often the references for Nuriev’s cohort of global minimalists, even if they don’t always realize it. “So many people are riffing on things they don’t know about,” says Patrick Parrish, Nuriev’s New York gallerist, nodding to the fact that young designers are bombarded by so many digital images that they often lose sight of where an idea begins. “Harry’s not like that. He knows exactly what he’s referencing.”

This style, in part, follows last decade’s midcentury modern craze, though softens those hard edges, making a space more inviting. It’s also an outgrowth of market forces: The popularity of midcentury furniture rendered the classics too costly for young designers, who were forced to look for more obscure vintage inspiration. Of course, it takes a new generation of designers to see old decades with fresh eyes: Often, they’ve been exposed to only its most superlative examples, and only in magazines and books, as opposed to, say, their Great-aunt Marg’s apartment. And then there’s the fact that simpler forms, like the arch, don’t require the craftsmanship of more complicated designs.

Nuriev, who had six years of training at the Moscow Architectural Institute, says he was first drawn to the arch because “it was very classic — Roman, Italian, Greek,” and he wanted to figure out how to “use it in real life, to make it sexy.” He says that when he first started using them, back in 2014, “it looked weird.” The pink, likewise, “looked girlish,” and people would ask him why he was using it. “It’s not that everybody copied me,” he says. “It’s just that I sensed something.”

What’s difficult to spot are references to Nuriev’s Russian upbringing, but they’re in fact there, if quietly. On the back wall of the kitchen hangs a blue-framed poster of Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet-Korean singer popular in the 1980s whom Nuriev calls “the Patti Smith of Russia.” Above the sofa, he’s taped a small pamphlet, depicting the reformer Sergius of Radonezh, from his neighborhood’s Russian Orthodox Church: “In Russia,” he says, “it’s as customary to hang a gilt-framed icon in the house as it is to hang a painting over the sofa in American homes.” His version glances at both traditions, while adhering to neither.",The Man Designing Spaces for the Instagram Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/design/harry-nuriev.html

The difference between being in ninth grade, or a senior in college, or even a catering grunt on the cusp of 30, and now, when I am an actual, indisputable grown-up, is that I can put together a real straight-up, sit-down dinner party in two hours rather than two months. I still cut branches and collect interesting grasses on a morning walk. And my decades of spending school and rent money on yard-sale cotton cocktail napkins, silver nut picks, pearl-tipped hors d’oeuvres forks and ivory-handled cake servers means I can set a beautiful and interesting table in 10 minutes.

And I am now dead sure that the food of a dinner party wants to be made entirely in the home by that home’s cook, with all of that home’s idiosyncrasies writ large. If there is even a whiff of professional chef on the plate, your dinner party is off to a lousy start and won’t recuperate. Someone will invariably be compelled to take a photograph on her smartphone even before the salad course has been cleared, and then, as far as I’m concerned, we will have gathered for some fetishistic, unsavory purpose not meant for the home.

Table Talk Small talk need not be soporific. Before the dinner party, try to find some recent news items or weird science stories that people most likely haven’t heard about. Did you know that music is beneficial to cats undergoing surgery? Or that there is a library in Norway that is amassing 100 never-before-read books that no one can check out for 100 years?

The Martinez cocktail on this night is batched, not because I want to be slick but because I have a whisper-thin, gorgeous glass pitcher that I found for $11 at a Value Village when I was a grad student and that I am thrilled to have the opportunity to use. And while it may come off as an out-of-reach cheffy move to call for feuille de brick for the borek — and to offer no easy-to-source substitute — that is wholly a reflection of the Type A, rather rigid facet of my personality, not of my profession. I am just not ever going to be the kind of girl who says, “Go ahead, if you can’t find pigeon, make the pigeon pie with boneless chicken breasts.” Go find the brick; it’s an uncommon delight, shatteringly crisp and unusual, and most important, it’s the correct ingredient for the recipe.

But just because the cocktail is ready to pour over ice upon guests’ arrival, and the fried borek with halloumi and parsley and grape leaves is even better if fried a few minutes in advance of the party’s start, I’m still, always and forever, going to be about 10 minutes late. I’ve come to believe this is a necessary part of the successful dinner party — these decades later my good friends know this, too. They know to shepherd the uninitiated guests. Pile the newbies’ coats in the bedroom, take their flowers and get them right into water while I am still toweling off and combing my hair. And then we will roll out from there, take our seats around the table, open the wines and pour. The braised leeks and the lentils and the roasted rabbits will be resting on the sideboard. People will pass their plates to be served. At some point, you will tell your one good joke, which you got from your father. And the dessert — walnuts and tangerines and bars of bitter chocolate — will be set out when the candles have shrunk. By now, almost everyone at the table will know that there are more candles in the drawer, and that there is more brandy to be poured, and that we will be sitting around that table for many more hours, twisting the foils in our fingers as we linger.

Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.

Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”

The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.

Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.

The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a massive fraud scheme involving Russian officials.

In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors. “They protect themselves in this way,” he said.

A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment. Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.

How Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to Trump campaign, is a tangled tale. A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York. The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered. Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecution’s evidence.

While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russia’s top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.

Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.

In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaika’s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general’s office gave a memo detailing the charges — stamped “confidential”— to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.

Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas. She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.

The next month, Mr. Chaika’s office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor general’s website.

Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute. She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarov’s attorney, Scott Balber.

She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov’s son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.

In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor — an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika — had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian government’s effort to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and said a “government lawyer” would fly to New York to deliver the documents.

Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstone’s emails as “goosed-up.” Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting. “Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues,” he said.

Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign. “I love it,” he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.

Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier. Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was “not related at all to the fact” that Donald Trump Jr. “was the son of the candidate.” But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.

Last week, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: “Of course they don’t like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, ‘Guys, what is happening with you at home? Who is in charge of your politics? Who is paying these politicians, and for what?’”

In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used “Russian money” to lobby for the sanctions law.

Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin. But a number of well-known Russian analysts called it inconceivable that Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.

One of the bright lights in this celebration has been the series of crosswords made by celebrity and veteran constructor teams, paired up by crosswords editor Will Shortz.

All of the celebrities that created puzzles for The New York Times were avid solvers, but none had undertaken the task of constructing a crossword before, except for former president Bill Clinton, who had a slight advantage after making one with constructor Cathy Allis (then Millhauser) for The New York Times Magazine in 2007 (answers to that puzzle are here).

LA BELLE SAUVAGE, by Philip Pullman. (Knopf, $22.99.) Pullman’s “His Dark Materials” trilogy, written nominally for young adults but just as suited to older ones, sold nearly 18 million copies, was translated into 40 languages, and was adapted for both stage and screen. “La Belle Sauvage” is the first volume of a new trilogy that starts before “His Dark Materials” begins and will continue, the author says, nearly a decade after it finishes. “It’s a stunning achievement, the universe Pullman has created and continues to build on,” our reviewer Sarah Lyall writes. “All that remains is to sit tight and wait for the next installment.”

TENEMENTS, TOWERS & TRASH: An Unconventional Illustrated History of New York City, by Julia Wertz. (Black Dog & Leventhal, $29.99.) Wertz has become a cult favorite for her graphic memoirs, which take on serious themes — her alcoholism and chronic illness — while leaving room for silly stoner humor. Her new book is a departure, focusing on her great love, New York. “It’s a passionate anatomy of the city,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “a book of dramatic streetscapes and hidden histories — mostly of infamous women, like the 19th-century celebrity abortionist Madame Restell, who catered to socialites and built her Fifth Avenue mansion a block away from a Catholic church, supposedly to taunt the faithful.”

RIGHTEOUS, by Joe Ide. (Mulholland, $26.) “Last year, Joe Ide became the best thing to happen to mystery writing in a very long time,” with his debut, “IQ,” our reviewer Janet Maslin writes. “He writes thumbnail descriptions that rival Elmore Leonard’s,” and “His dialogue, much of it unprintable here, has bite that puts him in the Winslow/Lehane league.” This follow-up again concerns Ide’s leading man, Isaiah Quintabe, this time investigating the death of his brother, who may not have been all he seemed. “Righteous,” like “IQ,” has “an ending that will make you hope for the arrival of another installment, pronto.”

Bad news, bears. Hibernation is no longer the coolest thing animals do to survive the winter.

As cold weather approaches, tiny mole-like creatures known as red-toothed shrews will shrink their own heads, reducing their skull and brain mass by as much as 20 percent, according to new research published Monday in Current Biology. When warm weather returns, they will regrow the region nearly to its original size, giving new meaning to the phrase “spring ahead.”

Though it is not yet clear why the shrews go down a few sizes for the winter, the authors of the study speculate that the reduced head and brain size helps them conserve energy when resources are scarce.

“These tiny mammals cannot migrate long distances to avoid winter, nor can they enter any kind of energy-saving state” like hibernation, said Javier Lazaro, a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and an author of the study. They also have high metabolic rates and very little fat stored in their bodies. “Therefore, they starve within a few hours if they do not hunt constantly.”

The researchers say the shrinkage is a survival strategy.

“Brain tissue is energetically very expensive, so reducing overall brain size might decrease energy demands and thus food requirements,” he said.

Take the subway to the Jiriho z Podebrad station, where you’ll find one of the city’s best farmers markets in full swing in front of the remarkable Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord, a 1932 modernist construction by the Prague Castle architect Joze Plecnik. For an old-school breakfast, stop by the Antoninovo Pekarstvi, a bakery offering excellent kolace (22 koruna), the traditional Czech pastries that inspired the kolache trend in Texas and elsewhere. Then buy a brown-butter (56 koruna), maple-bacon (54 koruna) or vegan chai (56 koruna) doughnut from the new Donut Shop, and sample a similar tale of international pastry conquest in reverse.

6) Noon. Shots and Streetwear

The party-friendly Vinohrady and Zizkov neighborhoods around Jiriho z Podebrad square are known for great bars, but the area also has several alternative clothing boutiques. The new NeverEnough shop sells funky T-shirts from brands like Berlin’s The Dudes, Warsaw’s Turbokolor and Paris-based Yeaaah! Studio, as well as its own line of hoodies. An in-house bar offers cocktails and shots of Bulleit rye. Nearby, Sugar Bat sells women’s rockabilly, goth and swing fashions, including crinoline petticoats (around 1,000 koruna) and an array of vintage-inspired dresses. Farther north, the Botas 66 shop on Krizkovskeho sells footwear modeled on the classic Botas sneakers of Communist Czechoslovakia, a perfect match for a new backpack (1,750 koruna) from the Borivojova street showroom of cult Czech brand Playbag.

Try the fluffy, Hokkaido-style milk bread toast, with rose hip and fragrant orange-blossom jams (130 koruna). More substantial meals include an eye-opening bowl of spicy laksa noodles, redolent with coconut milk and chiles (245 koruna).

Don’t worry about walking off lunch just yet: Next door, the year-old Book Therapy offers Prague’s best collection of reading material on art, architecture and design, most of which is in English. For a local souvenir, ask for the coffee-table volume on the great photographer Josef Sudek (1,699 koruna) or Vladislav Rostoka and Dusan Junek’s “Typografikum,” a masterpiece of graphic design (1,890 koruna), or choose from the small collection of home furnishings, like the set of hand-turned wooden bowls from the east Bohemian town of Dobruska (699 koruna).

9) 4 P.M. By the Bite

Until recently, the area to the north of Wenceslas Square and east of the trendy shopping on Na Prikope street has been relatively uninteresting. But new attractions like Spejle are luring people to Jindrisska street. Spejle takes its name from the skewer used to serve almost everything it offers. Ask for a glass of a dry Czech white wine from a producer like Horak (90 koruna) and pair it with any of the dozens of tapas-style dishes, all priced at 29 koruna per skewer. You can sample Czech classics in just a few bites: Traditional recipes include gingery roast duck with braised red cabbage, and juicy baked bucek, or pork belly, with a dollop of mashed potatoes and apple-horseradish sauce.

His most recent has changed the atmosphere on somewhat rundown Havlickova street, installing the comfortable bistro and deli La Bottega Linka in the overlooked area just north of the Masarykovo Nadrazi train station.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

SPECIAL POST — The 12th World Sudoku Championship, which I’ve attended in Bangalore, India, has just ended. It was the largest WSC to date — 206 competitors from 32 countries. Most countries were represented by four-person teams, although individual solvers could take part as well.

The contestants tackled almost 150 tough sudoku and sudoku variations over two days, scoring points for correct solutions. Point values varied according to the difficulty of the puzzles.

When it was over, the top five teams were China, Japan, France, USA and Czech Republic. China and Japan towered over everyone else.

The top individual solvers were Kota Morinishi of Japan (4,890 points) and Tiit Vunk of Estonia (4,887), with only 3 points separating them.

We spend time ruminating on how to get ourselves unstuck and then, as if by magic, we figure it out and the puzzle falls for us. That’s a good feeling.

Today, we get to experience that feeling nine times in one puzzle. Ten, actually, if we count the meta that Alan Arbesfeld has neatly tucked inside his grid. Mr. Arbesfeld debuts a puzzle called “Walls and Doors,” and the idea behind it is that we are given nine 5x5 “rooms” that need to be filled in. Each answer is five letters long and the clues are not hard to solve. The roadblock occurs because the clues are not given in any particular order, so it is up to us to figure out where each word goes.

For me, that was the hardest part of the puzzle. One letter in each grid is filled in (spelling out the phrase “floor plan”), but that was only of nominal help to me. After much erasing — you want to do this one in pencil — I was able to get the central grid No. 5. That was encouraging, but then I needed to start all over again and solve another grid. I knocked out No. 8. And so on, until I had experienced seven of the nine “Aha!” moments.

But that last sentence in the instructions bothered me: “When the puzzle is done, six familiar 15-letter phrases will read through the openings across and down.” What could that mean? I stared at my mostly finished grid and then I saw it. Running down the center of the grid was the phrase HEAVY METAL BANDS.

In fact, it seemed so natural that I began to wonder what other kinds of dedicated pet spaces animal lovers might have made for their pets. If I, with my limited funds and square footage, had devoted a room — albeit a very small one — to my furry friends, what kinds of over-the-top spaces were animal enthusiasts with larger budgets creating for their pets?

With a little research, I discovered such efforts could range from a living room wall transformed into a cat jungle gym to an entire studio apartment dedicated to a family of pets, including three parrots, a feral cat and a 35-year-old tortoise. Many animal lovers in New York and beyond, it seems, think nothing of the cost involved in creating a special space for their pets — even when that sort of customization might cut into the profits when it comes time to sell their homes.

Hunt Slonem, an artist celebrated for his whimsical paintings of animals (particularly bunnies), carved 1,200 square feet out of his 30,000-square-foot studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for his bird family.

Mr. Slonem has kept birds as pets for most of his life, and he currently has about 60 of them, all rescues, including a 75-year-old macaw called Sebastian and a cockatoo named Clyde that follows him everywhere.

The space he has devoted to the birds features dozens of suspended cages, often left open so the birds can fly free, and tile imported from Nicaragua that Mr. Slonem said helps to “define the space and stylishly conceal the droppings.”

Inside this indoor avian community, Mr. Slonem’s birds are free to talk, spat and mate — some for life, as they see fit. The space is so open and accommodating that many of the more social birds, including a close-knit clique of Amazon parrots, make regular house calls to each other’s cages. Feeding the birds, which takes up to five hours a day, requires the full-time services of a professional bird minder who has worked for Mr. Slonem for 35 years and who serves them a fresh salad of leafy greens, melons, bananas, grapes and tofu.

In Mr. Slonem’s latest book, “Birds,” he describes them as his muses and confidantes. He regularly paints among them, and whenever he is within earshot of the aviary, he said, the birds begin to chant his name in unison. “They’re as smart as three-year-olds,” Mr. Slonem said. “And they have huge personalities. They’re my dear friends, a relief from the humdrum of life.”

While Mr. Slonem shares his sprawling studio with the birds, he hasn’t given up any of his own living space. But other New Yorkers have.

In New York by Gehry building in Manhattan, Lucy Swift Weber’s 10-year-old Yorkie, Chauncey, is recovering from cancer. When things got particularly rough last year, Ms. Weber decided to convert the guest bedroom in her two-bedroom apartment into Chauncey’s room, to “give him the space to heal.”

Photo

Along with an en-suite bathroom — good for quick water refills and easy cleanup — the dog’s bedroom has a set of customized pet stairs, a plush floor-pillow lounge and a six-foot-tall headboard that Ms. Weber upholstered in a fabric she designed herself. “It’s become this warm, comfortable world where Chauncey can relax and rehabilitate,” Ms. Weber said. “I tried to make the room both calming and cheerful enough that he would want to spend time there, and it worked. He’s in there all of the time by choice.”

But even once he is in better health, Ms. Weber said, Chauncey will continue to have a room of his own; she and her boyfriend just moved into a larger, three-bedroom apartment on another floor of the same building, so that her boyfriend’s college-age sons won’t have to sleep in Chauncey’s room when they visit.

Caroline Stern, who owns three condos on the same floor of her building on Central Park West, went a step further and dedicated an entire 650-square-foot studio to her pets, where they can sleep and roam free when they’re not with her.

Next door to Ms. Stern’s apartment, the pet condo is home to three parrots — Apricot, Sinbad and Roxanne (a Moluccan cockatoo that serves as an emotional support animal) — a feral cat named Butch and an Russian tortoise named Alberta.

To accommodate these animals, Ms. Stern filled the condo with hand-built oversized aviaries, towering bird trees and an ultraviolet-lighted reptile area with a special water bath for Alberta. “Birds are loud,” Ms. Stern said. “It’s comforting to have a soothing place to put them when I can’t deal with the screaming.”

Ms. Stern’s neighbors are more than aware of her pet condo, but for the most part, she said, they are more charmed than perturbed. “It’s an animal-friendly building,” she said. “People stop by to visit; they know they’re lucky pets.”

Such devotion raises an obvious question: When designing extravagant spaces for pets, is property value even worth taking into consideration? As adorable as some of these animal rooms are, they often come at a hefty real estate cost.

“Whether it’s for a person or a parrot, customizing a property always makes it more difficult to sell,” said Ryan Serhant, of Nest Seeker’s Serhant Team. “An animal-dedicated space makes it even more challenging, because they often leave behind lingering smells and damaged surfaces that scare prospective buyers into thinking they’d have to renovate.”

There are, however, less expensive and less intrusive ways to create inviting pet habitats.

In Penfield, N.Y., Jill Sanders sacrificed a single wall in her 15-foot-wide living room to accommodate Nadia, a one-year-old Siberian cat she has been fostering for the last seven months and plans to adopt. Three months ago, when Mrs. Sanders decided to bring home two puppies, she knew she would have to get creative to keep Nadia comfortable. So she called on Mike Wilson and Megan Hanneman, founders of Catastrophic Creations, to devise a dedicated space for Nadia along the living room wall, where the cat could play and escape from the dogs when necessary.

More than 10 feet tall and five feet off the ground, the cat playground is composed of several floating sisal post steps, scratching posts, landing shelves, canvas hammocks and a rope bridge. “Everyone that sees it is blown away by its design-savviness,” Mrs. Sanders said. “I just wanted to give her something that brought her as much joy as she brings our family.”

And in Chicago, Guita Griffiths enlisted the help of Shelley Johnstone, of Shelley Johnstone Design, to create a practical but comforting place for Margaux, her 70-pound yellow Labrador retriever, in her 110-square-foot mudroom.

“Margaux’s a big dog,” Mrs. Griffiths said. “We needed a space to keep her when guests came over, where she wouldn’t feel trapped or anxious.” The result is a 5-by-8-foot space devoted entirely to the 3-year-old dog.

Along with luxuries like heated marble floors, an overstuffed dog bed and canine-printed wallpaper, the room has a spacious sink for Margaux’s baths, storage for her leashes and toys, and a Dutch door, so she can be shut inside without feeling claustrophobic.

And why not?

As Mrs. Griffiths said, “Margaux is just like any other member of our family.”","A Bedroom for Rover, Maybe Even a Condo",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/a-bedroom-for-rover-maybe-even-a-condo.html

After coming so close to the World Series, they now expect to get there, and win, within the term of the next manager’s contract. Girardi took this group to the edge of a title, and now his successor — they hope — will haul it over the top.

For all the niceties in the five-sentence statement from General Manager Brian Cashman announcing the move — he praised Girardi’s work ethic and heart, and wished him well — he gave no explanation for the move.

“Everything this organization does is done with careful and thorough consideration,” the statement said, leaving open the question of what Cashman considered to be lacking in Girardi.

After a decade of working with him, Cashman knew precisely what he had in Girardi. He is said not to have held Girardi’s tactical blunder in the division series against him (Girardi failed to ask for a video review that could have prevented a Cleveland Indians grand slam), but he knows what kind of team he has built, and he decided not to have Girardi lead it.

To Cashman, Girardi’s style might not mesh well with a team of players in their 20s. The veterans Girardi managed for most of his tenure, essentially, were fully formed major leaguers before they played for him. A younger group may respond better to a manager who projects less tension and more outward calm.

In the A.L.C.S., the Yankees got a close look at a manager who does that, one with renowned communication skills: A. J. Hinch of the Astros, who recovered from three losses at Yankee Stadium to take the final two games in Houston. Hinch’s Astros also eliminated the Yankees in the 2015 A.L. wild card game, the Yankees’ only other playoff appearance in the last five years.

“He just believes in every single one of us, and he shows you that,” Alex Bregman, the Astros’ 23-year-old third baseman, said on Thursday. “He shows that he has confidence in everybody on our roster. He’s a motivator and a guy that you want to play for — a guy that you want to run through a wall for.”

Girardi speaks often of believing in his guys. But he showed no faith in Dellin Betances, a four-time All-Star reliever, when he yanked him after he had faced two batters in his final appearance of the regular season — with a four-run lead in the ninth inning.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Betances had seemed to be turning around an inconsistent season, but after that outing he became a playoff afterthought. Twice Girardi pulled him after two batters in the postseason when the Yankees held a big lead, and by the fateful Game 7 of the A.L.C.S. — after burning Chad Green for two and a third innings in Game 6 — Girardi was left with limited options.

Of course, the Yankees did not score in Game 7, so their pitching options made little difference. And bullpen management, in general, has always seemed to be a strength of Girardi’s, along with his meticulous preparation.

Yet over Girardi’s tenure, managers increasingly became extensions of the front office, and the Yankees, with their increasing emphasis on analytics, were no different. If Girardi and Cashman were still in lock step — on overall philosophy, game management or both — their partnership would most likely still be intact.

Instead, Cashman severed it, as the Washington Nationals did with Dusty Baker and the Boston Red Sox with John Farrell, both after having made the playoffs two years in a row. In one of his final acts on the job, Girardi made a point to seek out Hinch in the home clubhouse in Houston after Game 7 to congratulate him and wish him well.

“He’s a real class act,” Hinch said on Thursday, adding later, “I don’t think anyone goes through what Joe goes through in New York.”

Girardi went through it all as a winner — 10 seasons, 10 winning records and a somewhat puzzling departure. Fans once wondered how anyone could adequately replace Joe Torre, who won four championships. Now we could ask the same question about replacing Girardi, who won just one title but kept a stable, successful atmosphere for a decade.",The Yankees Had a Steady Winner in Girardi.

Even without clothes, books and photographs, “The moment you walk in, you know this is a habitable unit,” Mr. Hassan said.

Mr. Charles declined to say whether the apartment had been rented — or if a new tenant knew that the space might be illegal.","Newcomers, unschooled in city rules and the unscrupulous ways of some landlords, may also find themselves in illegal housing. These situations tend to happen in neighborhoods undergoing rapid gentrification where the rents are rising fast and landlords see a way to squeeze more money out of a space.

In 2016, the city’s Department of Buildings received 18,844 complaints about potentially illegal conversions in the city. If an inspector finds tenants living in an illegal apartment in dangerous conditions, for example, if the apartment does not have adequate fire safety measures, a vacate order could force tenants out. However, in most cases, an inspector will issue the building owner a violation with a court summons, ordering the owner to correct the problem. Tenants living in such apartments may be able to withhold rent.

Over the past year, William J. Gribben, a tenant lawyer and a partner at the Manhattan law firm Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue and Joseph, has noticed a spike in calls to his office from tenants complaining about illegal apartments. Most of the calls come from tenants who have rented out a single bedroom in a larger apartment.

With strangers living together, bedroom doors often have deadbolt locks, a violation of city occupancy and fire rules. The arrangement may also create a de facto single room occupancy hotel, which would likely violate the city housing maintenance code. “It’s dangerous for tenants,” Mr. Gribben said of a phenomenon that he said “has snowballed.”

Some apartments, like the one where I lived, raise red flags from the moment you step inside. But other illegal arrangements are harder to spot. Paint the walls, add a kitchen and a bathroom to the fourth floor of a three-family townhouse, and who would ever know that the certificate of occupancy limits the number of legal apartments to three, not four?

That’s what happened to Mr. Hassan, a marketing manager who moved to New York from Denver in May 2016. He found the Bedford-Stuyvesant studio listed on Craigslist for $1,350 a month. Located on the top floor of a brownstone, the apartment looked ordinary. “When I signed the lease, there was nothing in there that said, ‘This is not a rentable unit,’” said Mr. Hassan, 51.

But in July 2017, the city’s Department of Buildings posted a notice at the entrance to the building alerting tenants to a complaint about an illegal unit. Mr. Hassan was baffled. His apartment had polished wood floors, full-size windows and a renovated bathroom. The kitchen, however, lacked a stove, a detail that might have given another renter pause. But Mr. Hassan’s apartment in Denver did not have a stove either, so he did not find the setup unusual.

Mr. Hassan’s landlord, Kwabena Charles, explained to Mr. Hassan that the building’s certificate of occupancy only permitted three rentable units. In order to pass a buildings department inspection, Mr. Hassan would have to pack up his possessions and remove his name from the door to the building. Mr. Hassan doubted the plausibility of the scheme. Even without clothes, books and photographs, “The moment you walk in, you know this is a habitable unit,” Mr. Hassan said.

Mr. Hassan also worried about what would happen if he erased all evidence of his residency. Without a lease or his name on the door, how could he prove that he lived in the apartment if, say, he came home to find his belongings missing?

Illegal apartments “hurt the tenants who get involved,” Mr. Gribben said.

In a rambling conversation that Mr. Hassan recorded and later shared with me, Mr. Charles blamed Mr. Hassan for creating a fire hazard because he kept too many possessions in his apartment. He also said that if a fire were to start in Mr. Hassan’s apartment, “the whole building goes up in flames, everybody dies.”

Yet Mr. Charles did not want Mr. Hassan to vacate the space. Instead, he told him to purge his belongings and help mislead the inspectors. “How to get rid of an inspector is to overdo it or to dumb it down so they’re not smart enough” to realize that anyone lives in the space, Mr. Charles explained on the tape. “I could do anything. This could be my clubhouse,” he said of the fourth-floor space.

But after inspectors visited the building twice but failed to get into the apartment, the Department of Buildings closed the investigation. The buildings department typically closes investigations after two unsuccessful inspection attempts. A new complaint would trigger a new investigation.

In late September, Mr. Hassan left and moved into a two-month sublet elsewhere in Brooklyn. “Things were not improving,” Mr. Hassan said. “I just wanted to get away.”

In early October, the apartment was listed for $1,500 a month on Craigslist as a “charming studio.” Mr. Charles said to me, “I haven’t violated anything.” He explained that even though the building is zoned as a three-family home, he could rent out the fourth unit because it had a hot plate instead of a stove. Without a complete kitchen, “there’s nothing wrong with it.” But according to the city buildings department, the fourth floor attic of a three-family home must remain unoccupied, even without a stove.

By mid-October, the listing had been removed from Craigslist. Mr. Charles declined to say whether the apartment had been rented — or if a new tenant knew that the space might be illegal.",Could You Be Living in an Illegal Apartment?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/could-you-be-living-in-an-illegal-apartment.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

So we tested Google’s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses.
Setting Up Advanced ProtectionAnyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Google’s Advanced Protection webpage.
Google’s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys.
When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google’s keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: “No comment.”","The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you. Google was one of the first companies to start offering two-factor authentication back in 2010, not long after it learned that it had been hacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers.

After the attack, Google’s security team came up with a motto: “Never again.” The company later rolled out two-factor authentication for Google customers’ Gmail accounts. It involved text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password in order to log in.

Unfortunately, those text messages can be hijacked. Last month, security researchers at Positive Technologies, a security firm, demonstrated how they could use vulnerabilities in the cellular network to intercept text messages for a set period of time.

The idea of Google’s Advanced Protection Program is to provide people with a physical device that is much harder to steal than a text message. Google is marketing the program as a tool for a tiny set of people who are at high risk of online attacks, like victims of stalking, dissidents inside authoritarian countries or journalists who need to protect their sources.

But why should extra-tough security benefit such a small group? Everyone should be able to enjoy stronger security.

So we tested Google’s Advanced Protection Program and vetted it with security researchers to see if the program could be used by the masses. The verdict: Many people should consider signing up for the security system and buying a pair of keys. But if you are married to some non-Google apps that are not yet compatible with the keys, you should wait and see if the program matures.

Setting Up Advanced Protection

Anyone with a Google account can sign up for the security program on Google’s Advanced Protection webpage. To get started, you will have to buy two physical keys for about $20 each. Google recommends buying one from Feitian and another from Yubico.

The keys, which look like thumb drives and can fit on your key chain, contain digital signatures that prove you are you. To set one up, you plug the key into a computer USB port, tap a button and name it. (The Feitian key wirelessly communicates with your smartphone to authenticate the login.) This process takes a few minutes.

On a computer and a smartphone, you need to log in with the key only once, and Google will remember the devices for future logins. That is more convenient than traditional two-factor authentication, which requires entering a unique code each time you log in.

But there are trade-offs. Google’s Advanced Protection cuts off all third-party access by default, allowing only applications that support its security keys. For the time being, that means only Google’s Gmail mail app, Google’s Backup and Sync app, and Google’s Chrome browser.

On an iPhone, for example, you will have to use Google’s Gmail or Inbox apps for email, and on a computer, you can use only the Chrome browser when signing in with a browser. So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you’re out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.

Testing the Security

Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.

Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.

On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don’t have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.

Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google’s requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.

But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.

Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google’s program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.

“It’s something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,” Ms. Sandvik said. “I don’t see a reason you shouldn’t turn this on.”

The Bottom Line

While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.

It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google’s apps from Apple’s and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google’s mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature — Apple’s V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google’s iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.

Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won’t work with the keys.

If using Google’s security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online. Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Google’s lead.

If you decide to wait, don’t procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages. While it is hackable, it is still much safer than relying on a password alone to protect you.

The question is how long it will take security researchers to find a way to hack the physical keys as well. When asked if he had already circumvented physical multifactor authentication devices like Google’s keys, Mr. Sabin would offer only: “No comment.”",How Google’s Physical Keys Will Protect Your Password,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/personaltech/google-keys-advanced-protection-program.html

Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami.
For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.
Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything.
But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.","Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centra’s founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world. They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.

Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year’s total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.

Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O. boom. The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens — Centra, Stox and Hubiits — has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.

But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.

“It’s undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. “But I’m not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects. I worry they are bringing attention to the scams.”

Coins of the Digital Wild West

The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token — with no physical backing — that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.

Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum. People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.

Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks — like the next generation of the internet.

But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.

The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company’s chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.

The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built. Mr. Trapani’s old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.

“You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!” he wrote in one post.

The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centra’s founders. In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.

“Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world’s first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,” the announcement said.

Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.

The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up. The photo on Centra’s website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra — and none of the details on Mr. Edward’s LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.

Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company’s marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted.

The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.

“When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,” Mr. Sharma said in an interview.

Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company’s site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.

There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.

After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.

But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.

“Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,” Mr. Gendron said.

Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company’s credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.

Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn’t own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.

The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla. who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.

“He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,” Mr. Fern said. “It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.”

Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was “a kid.”

He said the landlord’s statements were “not accurate.”

Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati

For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.

The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati. According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had “a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.”

Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma’s trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.

“As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,” the indictment said.

Mr. Sharma said that he couldn’t speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.

“I’m obviously not comfortable with that situation,” he said. “But it’s not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.”

He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.

Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra’s technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.

“He’ll do anything we ask,” Mr. Trapani said. “He’ll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.”

The boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid.

After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.

Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather’s spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. “We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,” Mr. Sharma said. “It was a very direct, individual deal.”

Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.

Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.

In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: “Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!” Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.

Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project — a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.

For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.

Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.

Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything. But they say that won’t happen.

Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.

“I see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,” Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. “Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.”

Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma’s enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.

“What’s important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product,” a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment. “That’s what matters to investors!”",How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/how-floyd-mayweather-helped-two-young-guys-from-miami-get-rich.html

Mr. Gleis pointed out that even “The Thinker,” of which the museum owns a 30-inch-tall bronze that was cast in the early 1880s, captures the artist’s endless search for intellectual fodder. The marble sculpture “Man and His Thought,” another item from the Alte Nationalgalerie’s permanent collection, shows a man breathing life into an androgynous figure.

Catherine Chevillot, director of the Musée Rodin, explained that the moment of inspiration is inextricably linked to the act of creation in the sculptor’s figures. “Rodin is permanently haunted by the question of what constitutes art,” she said by phone from Paris. “The idea that the artist has to decide at the moment that a creation arises — also that life arises — is key to understanding his work.”

Ms. Chevillot noted the particularly spontaneous nature of “The Hero,” in which the female muse emerges like “smoke or waves from the male figure, a continuity of form which mocks his realism.”

“Whether or not she has a head is of no importance to him,” she said of Rodin. “What is important is the deep expression of the composition as a whole.”

In the poem “Nike” — the exhibit will display the original manuscript, on loan from the Swiss National Library in Bern — Rilke tried not to respond directly to the sculpture but to create a work of art in its own right. In a 1920 letter to his patroness Nanny Wunderly-Volkart, he even tried to obscure the connection.

Photo

“It is never about translating a painting or a sculpture” into words, the Rilke scholar Torsten Hoffmann said by phone from Frankfurt. “He finds that boring. He is interested in what a painting or sculpture can do for him as a poet and human being.”

“Nike” emerged after a period from 1916 to 1919 that Rilke described as “the most hopeless years” of his life. By 1922, Rilke had finished his most famous works, the “Duineser Elegien” and “Sonnets to Orpheus,” both of which were published in 1923. Mr. Hoffmann said, however, that it would be inaccurate to credit Rodin’s “Hero” with a phase of renewed creativity.

“Rilke senses his own condition in the sculpture, with this angel, genius or muse,” Mr. Hoffmann said, citing “the decisive turning point” for the poet as the end of World War I and his return to Paris. But Rilke’s first encounter with Rodin in the early 20th century had a direct effect on his aesthetic. The “New Poems” of 1907 and 1908 stand as a case in point.

“Rilke tries to create a very clear form — with 14 lines, 14 verses — something similar to a sculpture,” Mr. Hoffmann said. “Just as Rodin creates things with his hands, Rilke takes up external subjects at this time. In previous work, he is more introspective.”

Photo

Rilke not only handled the sale of Rodin’s work in the German-speaking world as his personal secretary from 1905 to 1906, but also defended him against conservative criticism in a 1907 lecture delivered in cities including Dresden and Bremen. A series of watercolors in particular had caused a scandal in Germany for their graphic nudity.

As early as 1896, the Alte Nationalgalerie acquired its first Rodin works. Its director at the time, Hugo von Tschudi, also became the first to purchase a Manet painting (“In the Winter Garden”) for a museum. “Rodin-Rilke-Hofmannsthal” will be set up among French Impressionist works as a kind of “exhibit within an exhibit,” said Mr. Gleis, paying homage to the farsighted vision of Mr. Tschudi and previous directors.

He acknowledged the challenge of contributing to the dialogue about Rodin after a glut of centenary events but said he hoped that the exhibit’s interdisciplinary approach would raise questions not just about art, but also about literary history.

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, whom Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people, apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly set child advocates’ hair on fire. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s who we are turning our backs on first.

Lesli is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state tuition. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she says, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who crawls into bed with Lesli when she wakes herself up screaming with nightmares — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Lesli is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Lesli and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress scrap a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers, and they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent — a remedy that has been the most successful path to legalize these children.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian are allowed into the United States and spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes as authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a border patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that border patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have failed to identify hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that border patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration partially canceled a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. Some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the address and name of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

In the midst of all of this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, says Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally. But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are standing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

Dreamers, despite having the most to lose, have been most adamant in rejecting Trump’s proposals. “It’s a white nationalist racist wish list,” says Cristina Jiménez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream.","To Help a Dreamer, Why Do We Have to Hurt Her Cousin?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/dreamers-children-immigration-congress.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours.

Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that “a store should be a social center.” To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.

During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art. Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.

Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.

With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.

“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.

You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.

Although the mourners are unlikely to be comforted, Lord & Taylor will not disappear entirely from New York’s streetscape; the famous Christmas windows should survive.

Literally speaking, of course, the movie is a string of such events, though it manages to fool, or at least to tease, the characters as well as the viewers. The robbery that sets the main plot in motion seems at first like an art-world provocation, and before he quite understands what has happened, Christian experiences the kind of thrill that art is supposed to elicit. His one night stand with an American journalist (Elisabeth Moss) is not so thrilling, but its very awkwardness has an arch, knowing quality. Staff meetings at the museum have a similar feel. Is the baby whom one of Christian’s colleagues brings into the room really his child? Is its presence a commentary on the persistence of innocence in a fallen world?

These situations tend to happen in neighborhoods undergoing rapid gentrification where the rents are rising fast and landlords see a way to squeeze more money out of a space.

In 2016, the city’s Department of Buildings received 18,844 complaints about potentially illegal conversions in the city. If an inspector finds tenants living in an illegal apartment in dangerous conditions, for example, if the apartment does not have adequate fire safety measures, a vacate order could force tenants out. However, in most cases, an inspector will issue the building owner a violation with a court summons, ordering the owner to correct the problem. Tenants living in such apartments may be able to withhold rent.

Over the past year, William J. Gribben, a tenant lawyer and a partner at the Manhattan law firm Himmelstein, McConnell, Gribben, Donoghue and Joseph, has noticed a spike in calls to his office from tenants complaining about illegal apartments. Most of the calls come from tenants who have rented out a single bedroom in a larger apartment.

With strangers living together, bedroom doors often have deadbolt locks, a violation of city occupancy and fire rules. The arrangement may also create a de facto single room occupancy hotel, which would likely violate the city housing maintenance code. “It’s dangerous for tenants,” Mr. Gribben said of a phenomenon that he said “has snowballed.”

Some apartments, like the one where I lived, raise red flags from the moment you step inside. But other illegal arrangements are harder to spot. Paint the walls, add a kitchen and a bathroom to the fourth floor of a three-family townhouse, and who would ever know that the certificate of occupancy limits the number of legal apartments to three, not four?

That’s what happened to Mr. Hassan, a marketing manager who moved to New York from Denver in May 2016. He found the Bedford-Stuyvesant studio listed on Craigslist for $1,350 a month. Located on the top floor of a brownstone, the apartment looked ordinary. “When I signed the lease, there was nothing in there that said, ‘This is not a rentable unit,’” said Mr. Hassan, 51.

But in July 2017, the city’s Department of Buildings posted a notice at the entrance to the building alerting tenants to a complaint about an illegal unit. Mr. Hassan was baffled. His apartment had polished wood floors, full-size windows and a renovated bathroom. The kitchen, however, lacked a stove, a detail that might have given another renter pause. But Mr. Hassan’s apartment in Denver did not have a stove either, so he did not find the setup unusual.

Mr. Hassan’s landlord, Kwabena Charles, explained to Mr. Hassan that the building’s certificate of occupancy only permitted three rentable units. In order to pass a buildings department inspection, Mr. Hassan would have to pack up his possessions and remove his name from the door to the building. Mr. Hassan doubted the plausibility of the scheme. Even without clothes, books and photographs, “The moment you walk in, you know this is a habitable unit,” Mr. Hassan said.

Mr. Hassan also worried about what would happen if he erased all evidence of his residency. Without a lease or his name on the door, how could he prove that he lived in the apartment if, say, he came home to find his belongings missing?

Illegal apartments “hurt the tenants who get involved,” Mr. Gribben said.

In a rambling conversation that Mr. Hassan recorded and later shared with me, Mr. Charles blamed Mr. Hassan for creating a fire hazard because he kept too many possessions in his apartment. He also said that if a fire were to start in Mr. Hassan’s apartment, “the whole building goes up in flames, everybody dies.”

Yet Mr. Charles did not want Mr. Hassan to vacate the space. Instead, he told him to purge his belongings and help mislead the inspectors. “How to get rid of an inspector is to overdo it or to dumb it down so they’re not smart enough” to realize that anyone lives in the space, Mr. Charles explained on the tape. “I could do anything. This could be my clubhouse,” he said of the fourth-floor space.

But after inspectors visited the building twice but failed to get into the apartment, the Department of Buildings closed the investigation. The buildings department typically closes investigations after two unsuccessful inspection attempts. A new complaint would trigger a new investigation.

In late September, Mr. Hassan left and moved into a two-month sublet elsewhere in Brooklyn. “Things were not improving,” Mr. Hassan said. “I just wanted to get away.”

In early October, the apartment was listed for $1,500 a month on Craigslist as a “charming studio.” Mr. Charles said to me, “I haven’t violated anything.” He explained that even though the building is zoned as a three-family home, he could rent out the fourth unit because it had a hot plate instead of a stove. Without a complete kitchen, “there’s nothing wrong with it.” But according to the city buildings department, the fourth floor attic of a three-family home must remain unoccupied, even without a stove.

By mid-October, the listing had been removed from Craigslist. Mr. Charles declined to say whether the apartment had been rented — or if a new tenant knew that the space might be illegal.",Could You Be Living in an Illegal Apartment?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/realestate/could-you-be-living-in-an-illegal-apartment.html

San Francisco — Every day, American citizens are detained in windowless rooms at international airports with little to no scrutiny. I am not referring to airports in some foreign country; I am referring to our airports here in the United States. I know, because it happened to me.

Earlier this month, I was returning to San Francisco from a trip to Armenia and Greece. Without a single question, but with careful scrutiny of my face and Middle Eastern features, an agent from the Department of Homeland Security at San Francisco International Airport ordered me to a room in the back of the terminal. As I headed to the detention area, I had many thoughts racing through my head. The biggest one, however, was practical: How does detaining, based on his appearance, a San Francisco prosecutor who has spent most of his professional career advancing public safety, make America safer?

After about an hour of waiting, my interrogator came to ask me some questions. He asked me about my trip to Armenia, whether I had attempted to sneak into Turkey or Syria during my vacation, whether I had visited any refugee camps and whether I had joined any groups like ISIS. These are astoundingly ignorant questions. For one thing, I am an Armenian-American whose family escaped the Lebanese Civil War over 35 years ago. As a descendant of the Armenian Genocide, a genocide perpetrated by Turks, there is absolutely no logical reason I would sneak into Turkey from Armenia (especially since Turkey has blockaded that border). Furthermore, as an Armenian, I am a Christian, and as Armenians in Syria and Iraq have experienced, meeting with jihadist groups would have led to my kidnapping and possible beheading.

It wasn’t until some time into my questioning that the officer asked what I did for a living. I told him I was a prosecutor in the San Francisco district attorney’s office, a fact that could have been revealed with a simple Google search. My detention ended shortly after that information came to light. What never came to light, however, is why they detained me in the first place. They never gave me a straight answer, and I have very few avenues for recourse. My detention was well within the rules.

The ham-handed nature of my interrogation is worth recounting, because it points to the nature of racial profiling, and its widespread use at our borders. Even if I had been a Muslim American, what connection would my appearance or religion have to my potential risk to national security?

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

To answer that question, one must first try to understand why racial profiling occurs. It is born from misplaced and unjustified fear, among other more morally bankrupt reasons. That fear creates racist policies in our country, and not just at our borders: You can see it in the over-policing of predominantly African-American neighborhoods, the over-incarceration of African-Americans, the calls for mass deportations of Latino immigrants and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. In each case, one’s identity, or skin color, or religion is taken as sufficient evidence of a dangerous intent. Some will try to disavow the racism by saying that these traits are simply a convenient proxy, but it amounts to the same thing. If you detain Muslims at the airport because of a stereotype about Muslims and terror, the problem isn’t them.",Seeing Danger in a Face,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/danger-racial-profiling-america.html

But Mr. Bain, an airline publicist at the time and a pilot himself, invented most of it, including the authors’ names, Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones. (Mr. Bain’s “help” was credited on the cover with the line “with Donald Bain.”)

“I suppose you could say that I became the world’s oldest, tallest, bearded stewardess,” he told Killer Nashville magazine last year.

Perhaps sensing that “Coffee, Tea or Me?” would become a best seller, his fanciful stewardesses dedicated their book to “Don Bain, writer and friend, who’s flown enough to know how funny it really can be.”

Photo

After the book was published in 1967, one of the two real-life Eastern Airline attendants legally changed her name to Rachel Jones to capitalize on her newfound fame.

The book’s title, Mr. Bain said, was derived from a sexist punch line: A stewardess asks the pilot whether he would prefer “coffee, tea or me?” To which he replies leeringly, “Whichever is easier to make.”

Mr. Bain promoted one of several satirical sequels, “How to Make a Good Airline Stewardess” (1972), by another fictitious author, by organizing a Stewardess Anti-Defamation Defense League to denounce the book as chauvinistic.

His more than 125 books included 46 “Murder, She Wrote” mysteries, inspired by the television series of the same name starring Angela Lansbury. Many were written in collaboration with his second wife, Renee Paley-Bain.

He began secretly collaborating with Margaret Truman, the daughter of former President Harry S. Truman, in the early 1980s; the first book they wrote together was “Murder on Capitol Hill” (1981). Ms. Truman — she was otherwise known as Margaret Truman Daniel — died in 2008, but the series continued with two dozen books under her name, followed by six under Mr. Bain’s.

“With the ‘Margaret Truman Capital Crimes’ series,” Mr. Bain explained, “I operate from the standpoint that there is absolutely nothing that I can make up that is far-fetched when it comes to Washington, D.C., and the political climate there.”

“Lights Out,” the first full-length work of fiction that he wrote under his own name and that came solely from his own imagination, was not published until 2014.

“That it took me 50 years to see my own novel published was not due to a paucity of ideas, or a half-century of writer’s block,” Mr. Bain told Publishers Weekly in 2014. “It was because I didn’t want Samuel Johnson to consider me a blockhead: ‘No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money,’ the esteemed Mr. Johnson once said.

“I’ve made a living all these years as a ghost who makes others sound good,” Mr. Bain continued. “I’ve been a journeyman writer and proud of it. I’ve attacked every book with the philosophy that it’s the most important book I’ve ever written, and maybe the last I will write, no matter whose name is on it.”

Donald Sutherland Bain was born on March 6, 1935, in Mineola, N.Y. His father, George, whose family came from Scotland, manufactured milk cans. His mother was the former Constance Dailey.

Growing up on Long Island, he graduated from Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park, earned a bachelor’s degree from Purdue University in Indiana and served in the Air Force as a lieutenant.

His first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Pamela, he is survived by another daughter, Laurie Bain Wilson, who, like Pamela, is from his first marriage; a stepdaughter, Marisa Brown, and a stepson, William Paley, from his marriage to Renee Paley-Bain, who died at 71 last year; four grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren. Mr. Bain had recently moved from Danbury, Conn., to an assisted living home in Westchester County, N.Y.

Mr. Bain served in the Air Force while working as a disc jockey and announcer for radio and television stations in Texas. He then moved to New York, where he struggled to support his new family by selling children’s shoes at a department store and peddling typewriters. His fortunes changed when a cousin, a freelance writer who was overloaded with assignments, referred a writing project to him and connected him with a book editor.

His first book was a history of stock car racing, written under the name of a Nascar executive. The editor later introduced him to the two flight attendants.

Mr. Bain was among a stable of writers enlisted by Hans Ashbourne, a magazine publisher, to produce short stories that were then promoted as if they were excerpts from forthcoming books — except that the books did not exist.

“I Fly the Charter Passion Route” was one, supposedly adapted from “Flight From Erotica.”

His eclectic career also included a stint as a co-host of Long John Nebel’s all-night syndicated radio program, and voice-over work for public service announcements by the American Cancer Society. (During meetings with its executives, he would disappear into the men’s room to smoke.) He played the vibraphone for fun.

In 1988, Mr. Bain became the alter ego of television’s most famous contemporary mystery writer, Jessica Fletcher, the character played by Ms. Lansbury on “Murder, She Wrote,” which ran on CBS from 1984 to 1996. In the mid-’90s, he solved one enduring mystery by revealing that he was the author of the books that had been inspired by the series.

His manuscripts were vetted by the TV studio that owned the series. It protected Ms. Lansbury’s character so scrupulously, Mr. Bain said, that it once ordered him to excise a passage in which Jessica kissed a Scotland Yard inspector.

Mr. Bain’s favorites among the books he wrote, he said, were “A Member of the Family” (1993), a novel whose author is listed as Nick Vasile, a former undercover police officer, and “Charlie and the Shawneetown Dame” (originally published as “War in Illinois” in 1978), a nonfiction book about a 1920s gang war written under his own name.

He also wrote a memoir, originally published in 2002 as “Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume,” a reference to an aborted publicity stunt. It was reissued in 2006 as “Murder, He Wrote.”

Mr. Bain typically produced 2,500 words a day, sometimes dictating into a tape recorder, and beginning each morning by editing the previous day’s draft.

He cautioned against too much meddling by editors, though, quoting H. G. Wells: “No passion in the world is equal to the passion to alter someone else’s draft.”

“A global conversation about sexual harassment, toxic masculinity and the institutional sexism that envelops the industry is much needed,” she said.

Some women in the audience raised a fist in solidarity. One shouted, “Topple the patriarchy!” A few men shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

During a cocktail hour before the ceremony — Women and Hollywood held a similar event in New York last week and will host one in London next month — honorees like Lenora Lapidus, director of the Women’s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, networked over coconut chicken skewers and cilantro steak empanadas.

“There’s a teeny silver lining,” Ms. Lapidus said about the deluge of allegations. “It’s reached such a crescendo that there’s no going back.”

A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he co-founded, has repeatedly denied “any allegations of nonconsensual sex.”

The ArcLight, an upscale movie theater and event space in the heart of Hollywood, was simultaneously hosting a premiere for “Jigsaw,” which Lionsgate hopes will restart its “Saw” franchise. As women at Ms. Silverstein’s gathering cited statistics about gender inequality in moviedom — women buy 50 percent of movie tickets in the United States, but only 7 percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2016 were directed by women — several dryly noted that it seemed appropriate to have a torture-themed horror movie as a backdrop.

One honoree, Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at the University of Southern California and author of damning reports about gender discrimination in the movie and television business, called Hollywood “a cesspool of humanity.” But Ms. Smith had high praise for Ms. Silverstein, whom she referred to as the entertainment industry’s “chief agitation officer.”

Ms. Silverstein, who grew up on Long Island and works from her Brooklyn apartment, has long focused on women’s causes. After graduating from Brandeis University in 1989 and earning a master’s degree from Columbia University in 1993, she worked for organizations like the Ms. Foundation and the White House Project, a now-defunct nonprofit dedicated to increasing female representation in business and government.

In 2007, she started a blog to push for gender diversity in the global film industry. She called it Women and Hollywood.

“I didn’t trust my voice at first, but I slowly put myself out there and started to get noticed,” Ms. Silverstein said. “Now I’m kind of a rabid dog,” she added with a chuckle.

On Twitter, where Ms. Silverstein has 33,500 followers, she has been encouraging abused women to come forward. On Thursday, she tweeted “#catchthebastards” and “#BelieveWomen.”

Although it has evolved into a larger organization, Women and Hollywood is still mostly known as a blog. Ms. Silverstein has a small staff of editors, and the site publishes articles by a range of freelancers. She does not sell advertising and depends on funding from sponsorships and people like Barbara Dobkin, a philanthropist dedicated to women’s issues.

Ms. Silverstein is also artistic director and co-founder of the Athena Film Festival, which programs films, like “Suffragette” and “Hidden Figures,” that highlight women in leadership roles. The eighth annual festival will take place at Barnard College in February.

Ms. Weingarten, the school union president, said in an interview on Thursday that Ms. DeVos’s calendar was a case study in her priorities.
The daily log of Ms. DeVos’s activity since February, when she was confirmed by the Senate, also shows extensive travel.
In addition, Ms. Hill said, Ms. DeVos also does not accept reimbursement for lodging or other travel-related costs.","Then, that same day, there was a meeting with the South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce, according to Ms. DeVos’s calendar, to discuss “her agenda for school choice and how we engage more African-American communities in that work to include charter schools.”

The appointment books also include discussions related to traditional public schools, such as a telephone call in February with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.7 million public schoolteachers and other employees nationwide. Ms. DeVos then had a follow-up visit in April with Ms. Weingarten to a public school in Ohio.

But the emphasis, a review of the calendar shows, is on the same kinds of alternatives that Ms. DeVos promoted when she was a conservative philanthropist donating money to groups like Alliance for School Choice and the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which advocate school choice.

Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, said she had met with a variety of players from the world of education, including state education chiefs, superintendents, principals and teachers. He also said that Ms. DeVos has visited more public schools since she started than religious or private schools.

“Secretary DeVos is focused on ensuring all students have equal access to a great education,” he said in a written statement, adding, “She has made no secret that giving parents more options is a critical way to help improve outcomes, and America’s families have been clear in their demands for more and better choices.”

The detailed calendar entries suggest Ms. DeVos remains closely involved with some of the people helping to lead or advise leaders in the school choice movement. Among them are Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, whom Ms. DeVos was scheduled to meet on June 21 to discuss language she could use to promote school vouchers without generating as much resistance to the effort, according to the notes in her agenda.

“Frank has a 60 slide deck of the words to use and the words to lose regarding parental choice, vouchers, charter schools, teacher pay and all the other issues in education reform,” the notes say.

On July 10, Ms. DeVos met with a Republican state senator from Tennessee, Brian Kelsey, according to her calendar, to discuss the “federal government’s plans for school vouchers.” In her first weeks on the job, she also had a call with former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. The topic was listed as “School Choice in Texas.”

According to the calendar, Ms. DeVos also met with Tim Keller and Richard Komer of the Institute for Justice, a conservative nonprofit that has joined lawsuits in Montana, Nevada and additional states to defend the ability of parents to use taxpayer-funded vouchers to cover tuition for their children to attend private religious schools. The goal of the meeting: “suggest a few areas where the Department could facilitate school choice efforts and offer the Sec. help in those areas.”

Mr. Komer said he had known Ms. DeVos for a decade and was glad to see her maintain her commitment to school choice.

“We would like to see them promote parent choice and parent power to choose,” Mr. Komer said of the 30-minute meeting he had with Ms. DeVos.

Her schedule also shows various appointments with representatives from the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Christian Schools and the Christian Academy for Reaching Excellence; with the education chairman from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and with officials from other religious groups.

Ms. Weingarten, the school union president, said in an interview on Thursday that Ms. DeVos’s calendar was a case study in her priorities.

“She has very much undermined public schooling, which 90 percent of children in America attend and which is the foundation to America’s democracy,” Ms. Weingarten said.

The daily log of Ms. DeVos’s activity since February, when she was confirmed by the Senate, also shows extensive travel. Ms. DeVos has said she pays for the trips herself since she typically goes on a privately owned plane.

Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that Ms. DeVos “travels on personally owned aircraft, accompanied by her security detail and whenever possible, additional support staff” without charging the government. In addition, Ms. Hill said, Ms. DeVos also does not accept reimbursement for lodging or other travel-related costs.

An examination of Ms. DeVos’s calendar shows that she frequently leaves Washington on what appear to be long weekends, as her work calendar indicates no appointments on certain Fridays or Mondays surrounding these trips to destinations that have included Vero Beach, Fla., Aspen, Colo., and Grand Rapids, Mich. All are places where Ms. DeVos or a member of her family owns a home.

The records show that Ms. DeVos took long weekends on at least 11 occasions, meaning that her work calendar indicates no appointments on at least one workday around the weekend.

On Friday, March 3, for example, the records show that Ms. DeVos went to Aspen — where her family owns a ski-in, ski-out home in Snowmass Village — and that she did not return to the office, or have any work appointments, until Tuesday, March 7.

She then left on March 8, for Sea Island, Ga., where she attended an American Enterprise Institute World Forum, with her calendar showing that she did not return to the office for work appointments until Monday, March 13.

On Thursday, March 30, Ms. DeVos’s calendar shows that she left her office at 3 p.m. for Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington on her way to Vero Beach, where she and her husband, Dick DeVos, have a home.

Austin Evers, a State Department lawyer during the Obama administration who now serves as the executive director of a liberal nonprofit group, American Oversight, which sued the Education Department for the records and provided a copy of them to The New York Times, said Ms. DeVos’s frequent days out of the office with no appointments on her calendar amounted to “truancy.”

Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, called the analysis of Ms. DeVos’s days away from Washington with no appointments “fatally flawed.” The entries, he said, only reflect formal appointments. Ms. DeVos is routinely working, he said, even if nothing is listed on her work calendar.

“Secretary DeVos isn’t a creature of Washington and prefers to spend her time in communities across the country with America’s students, parents and educators,” Mr. Bailey said in a statement. “She travels often to make that possible, and she travels at no expense to taxpayers.”",Betsy DeVos’s Schedule Shows Focus on Religious and Nontraditional Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/betsy-devos-work-schedule-education.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

(RED FAMINE: Stalin’s War on Ukraine)

作者：安妮·阿普尔鲍姆(Anne Applebaum)

461页。双日出版社(Doubleday)，35美元。

《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)专栏作家安妮·阿普尔鲍姆长期以来一直住在东欧，撰写关于那里的文章，她最著名的作品是获得普利策奖的《古拉格：一部历史》(Gulag: A History)。但我最喜欢的是她1994年出版的《东西之间：跨越欧洲边界》(Between East and West: Across the Borderlands of Europe)，这本书怪异而新颖，讲述她从波罗的海旅行至黑海的经历，她所经过的地区和城市在20世纪里曾先后属于好几个不同的国家。例如，今天的乌克兰西部城市利沃夫(Lviv)曾是苏联的Lvov；之前在两次世界大战之间曾是波兰的Lwow；1914年之前，它又是奥匈帝国的莱姆堡(Lemberg)。这还不包括它曾在一战期间被沙皇俄国占领，在二战期间被纳粹德国占领，1918年被一个短命的乌克兰民族主义组织占领的经历。

在那次旅行中，她走访的大多数人都感到自己的民族身份受到现在所属的国家的威胁、这个国家在过去曾是他们的压迫者。他们觉得自己不公平地变成了立陶宛化的波兰人，或者是白俄罗斯化了的立陶宛人或鲁塞尼亚人——鲁塞尼亚人没有自己的国家，而其他人似乎都有自己的国家。这本书很有先见之明，因为近几年崛起的政治人士精心培养的正是这种怨愤的、受伤的民族或国家自豪感，从布达佩斯的维克托·欧尔班(Viktor Orban)、莫斯科的弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)，到华盛顿的唐纳德·特朗普。

这种冲突的民族主义幽灵也贯穿在阿普尔鲍姆的新书《红色饥荒：斯大林对乌克兰的战争》之中，该书详细讲述了于1933年达到顶峰的大饥荒，据估计，它导致500多万苏联人死亡，其中390多万为乌克兰人。斯大林从之前几年开始，无情地强迫数百万独立的小农进入新的集体农场，他确信这样能够提高生产力，养活苏联的城市。那些农民当然拒绝放弃自己的土地，纷纷屠杀和吃掉被要求跟他们一起带走的家畜，他们被带去集体农场后——有时是被枪逼着去的——几乎毫无劳动积极性。

阿普尔鲍姆写道，甚至在实施灾难性的集体农业生产之前，俄罗斯的新统治者就已“再次遵循沙皇设定的先例”，“他们查封了乌克兰语报纸，禁止在学校使用乌克兰语，关闭了乌克兰语剧院”。1920年代中期，苏联政权稳固确立后，开始尝试一项新政策，就像在苏联的其他非俄罗斯地区一样，给予乌克兰语官方语言的地位，允许出版权威的乌俄词典。

Under its formula, the prime minister’s post, along with the interior and foreign ministries, are reserved for Shiites. Kurds get the presidency and finance ministry.

Iranian-trained Shiite militias are part of Iraq’s armed forces and have battled Islamic State militants since they seized nearly a third of Iraq in 2014. The militias have been accused of atrocities against Sunni civilians, and their presence near Sunni areas has alarmed many residents. A Shiite religious flag fluttered last week at an Iraqi military checkpoint outside Karmah.

Kurds have their own army as well, known as the pesh merga. But Sunnis have no national armed force, only tribal militias blended into Iraqi security forces to fight the militants.

Some Sunni politicians have advocated an autonomous Sunni region, but those proposals have gone nowhere amid partisan bickering.

“Sunnis have no unified leadership,” said Wathiq al-Hashimi, the head of the Iraqi Group for Strategic Studies, an independent research group in Baghdad. “And Sunni politicians seem to care only about narrow personal interests.”

A Kurdish referendum on independence last month further divided Sunnis. Most opposed it, preferring to keep Kurds inside Iraq as a counterweight against Shiite domination; virtually all Iraqi Kurds are Sunni. Many Sunnis cheered the government takeover of contested areas, where Sunni Arabs had seethed under Kurdish control.

But even Sunnis opposed to the Kurdish vote were alarmed when Iraqi forces conducted military maneuvers with Iranian troops inside Iran along the Iraq border.

“We won’t tolerate that kind of foreign interference on top of everything else,” said Sheikh Ahmed al-Karim, a Sunni lawmaker who generally supports the government of Mr. Abadi, the prime minister.

In Parliament, the Sunni-led bloc has 78 seats, roughly proportionate to their share of the population, but is dwarfed by the Shiite bloc, with 182. The Kurdish bloc has 65 seats. Parliament has fallen increasingly under the sway of Iran, which is locked in a regional power struggle with Sunni countries led by Saudi Arabia.

Mithal al-Alusi, a Sunni lawmaker, has called the government “a cardboard state” because of its ties to Iran. He has asked, acidly, whether Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite overseas military forces who has advised Iraq’s Shiite militias, had a proper visa to enter Iraq.

Shiites seem driven by a sense of religious grievance and a pan-Shiite destiny. Kurds are motivated by nationalism and dreams of independence. And Sunnis?

“For the Sunnis, there’s a lack of political cohesion about exactly what they want,” said Maria Fantappie, a senior analyst for Iraq at the International Crisis Group.

David L. Phillips, a former State Department adviser who has worked on Iraq for 30 years, said Sunnis had failed to organize as effectively as Shiites and Kurds.

“Baghdad is perfectly content to see the Sunnis in disarray,” he said.

There are a few hopeful signs. Because some Shiite factions will oppose Mr. Abadi in April, and Kurdish politics are in upheaval, he will have to court the Sunni bloc to help ensure re-election.","As ISIS Is Driven From Iraq, Sunnis Remain Alienated",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/middleeast/iraq-isis-sunni.html

Hundreds of millions of people around the world have grown to rely on it for news and information. Now Twitter and Facebook are facing a moment of reckoning. They, as well as Google, are being called to account for their role in the deception and chicanery that has surrounded the 2016 campaign, especially from accounts linked to Russia.

How much damage did those accounts do in the months leading up to the presidential election? No one knows, not even the companies themselves, which are slowly and grudgingly releasing data about what happened. Next week, they will send executives to testify at congressional hearings, the beginning of an attempt to calculate an answer.

Google and Facebook are powerful and wealthy companies that are skilled enough to ride out this controversy. But for Twitter — influential, yet smaller and far less financially successful — the situation is more vexing. Its devotion to open discourse is drawing an abundance of troublemakers who threaten to drive out the well-intentioned.

Many of Twitter’s users have long been frustrated with the site’s scattershot efforts at preventing abuse and harassment. Twitter’s critics have counted at least a half-dozen times over the last few years when the company has said it was taking an issue seriously but little seemed to change.

The debate about abuse and harassment has even fed complaints about Twitter’s most prominent fan, President Trump, and his use of the site as a cudgel against everyone from Kim Jong-un of North Korea to Jemele Hill of ESPN. Twitter’s guidelines forbid “threats of violence” and “targeted abuse” prohibitions that some users have tried to hold up against the rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump’s account.

In recent weeks, Twitter has updated its terms of service to better fit the company’s evolving views on hosting the president. That includes allowing tweets under the “newsworthy” label it might otherwise ban. But the platform was forced to apologize for the confusion it generated in trying to explain the changes, tweeting “We need to do better.”

Twitter declined to comment this week on President Trump. Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder, was dismissive of concerns over the president’s Twitter habits in an interview shortly before rejoining the company in the spring. “It’s too early to say we’re all going to die because Trump has a smartphone and can say what he wants to a lot of people,” he said.

There are already signs that Twitter’s bottom line is feeling the effects. An analysis by the research firm eMarketer this week anticipated the number of worldwide Twitter users growing ever more slowly in the years to come: 4 percent this year, 3 percent in 2018, 2.5 percent in 2019. Since other parts of social media — most notably Facebook — are growing faster, fewer than one out of 10 social media users will be on Twitter by 2019, eMarketer suggested.

“Hate speech and harassment are real impediments to attracting new users,” said Michael Pachter, managing director of the investment firm Wedbush Securities. “If you think about why are people alcoholics, it’s because they don’t acknowledge they’re alcoholics.”

He added about Twitter, “It has never managed to come to grips with harassment.”

Twitter said Thursday that it added four million users in the third quarter of this year. But it also said that it had overstated its user base by two million in the previous quarter, meaning the total user base rose by only two million, to 326 million, in the third quarter.

Its revenue dropped in the quarter from 2016, the company said, but not quite as much as expected. Its net loss narrowed, however, and the company suggested that a profitable quarter may come soon, pushing the stock up more than 20 percent in midday trading.

Twitter’s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, will represent the company in at least one congressional hearing next week. When the company originally briefed congressional investigators a month ago, the reviews were bad. Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence committee, called it “inadequate at every level.” He added that Twitter had “failed to understand how serious this issue is.”

On Tuesday, Twitter said it would “dramatically” increase ad transparency on the platform while also allowing people to report inappropriate ads or ads they simply do not like. Political ads will be specially marked. Mr. Warner called Twitter’s plan “a good first step.”

On Thursday, Twitter banned all advertising by two Russian news outlets, Russia Today and Sputnik, saying they “attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government.”

But the real problem facing Twitter is less with ads than with trolls, who take advantage of the anonymity the platform provides to wreak havoc. The still-incomplete history of @TEN_GOP bears out how reluctant or unable Twitter is to police such activity.

@TEN_GOP sprang to life in November 2015 bearing the seal of the state. It billed itself as the “Unofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans” but from the beginning, state Republican leaders knew something was fishy.

“We thought the handle, @TEN_GOP, was particularly weird,” said Mr. Leatherwood. “That’s not how you abbreviate Tennessee. Also, Tennessee law prohibits using the seal for political purposes.”

The real problem, though, was the vitriol it spewed. “It was using anti-immigrant and outright racist sentiments,” Mr. Leatherwood said. “It offended me as a conservative and a Christian, and went counter to what we were trying to do here.”

Since the account did not represent the Republican Party, even unofficially, Mr. Leatherwood twice reported it to Twitter for misrepresentation. He said others had as well. He never heard back.

After the election, the account ridiculed the idea that Russia had tried to affect the voting, celebrated President Trump’s firing of F.B.I. director James Comey by suggesting that Mrs. Clinton be arrested, and tweeted, “I love my whiteness. And yours.”

@TEN_GOP was a hot topic in Tennessee political circles.

“I can’t tell you how many conversations I had with editors, colleagues, political types about who was behind this crazy troll account,” said Cari Wade Gervin, a reporter with Nashville Scene who said she had also told Twitter that @TEN_GOP was misrepresenting itself. “But it never occurred to me it was the Russians.”

Twitter is, as ever, a work in progress. After it was harshly criticized this month for temporarily banning the actress Rose McGowan when she was speaking out about sexual harassment, chief executive Jack Dorsey pledged, “We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust.”

When asked about troll sites like @TEN_GOP, however, a Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. Instead, she pointed to a few recent company blog posts for background. One of them presented the company’s long-held philosophy: “We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth.”","Russia Fanned Flames With Twitter, Which Faces a Blowback",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia.html

SPECIAL POST — A team from Japan won the 26th World Puzzle Championship, which ended Saturday in Bangalore, India. The U.S.A. and Germany finished second and third.

The three-day competition — a companion to the World Sudoku Championship, held earlier in the week — drew 169 contestants from 27 countries. Over three days, the competitors tackled more than 300 pencil-and-paper puzzles involving logic, numbers and pictures. There were no crosswords or other puzzles testing vocabulary or knowledge, so everyone could compete on an equal basis irrespective of language or nationality.

In some rounds, lasting up to 60 minutes, the puzzles were so challenging that many contestants scored zero points. Three example puzzles from the competition, not the hardest ones, appear below.

Today’s Theme

We’re taking “Selfies” at each of our vacation stops, with a hilarious editorial acknowledgment of the selfie phenomenon in the circled/shaded squares (they all say “ME.”)

Each of the theme entries is a destination where Ms. Gray takes a selfie and then updates her Facebook status with the photo and a description of where she is. For example, at 16D she waxes (sorry) eloquent about visiting MADAM TUSSAUD’S museum: “Facebook Status: ‘Vegas, baby!

Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket.

New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration.

In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress. Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened. Clamping their shells to screen out noise pollution or other artificial irritants could prevent oysters from perceiving important biological cues, said the authors of the study.

Oysters “must be able to hear breaking waves and water currents,” which could trigger their biological rhythms, said Jean-Charles Massabuau, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an author of the study. “To hear the current arriving could prepare them for eating and digesting, possibly as when we hear and smell that somebody is preparing dinner.”

The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat.","This is not the first time that the Auto Alliance has dismissed the need for regulation. In 2011, for example, Robert Strassburger, vice president for vehicle safety at the organization, made a similar argument. “We shouldn’t overemphasize the effectiveness of technology,” he said, adding that a government requirement for warning devices would initially have minimal impact, because the vast majority of cars on the road are years old.

The Auto Alliance, like some other industry groups, calls for education rather than technology. For 10 years, it has pushed messages, both online and in print, that describe why cars overheat when parked in the sun and that advise parents never to leave children in a car.

But advocates for stronger rules say the years of educational efforts have not slowed the number of deaths. And in almost all cases, they say, the action is a matter of distraction and simple forgetfulness.

“You can’t teach people not to forget,” said Janette Fennell, president of KidsandCars.org, an organization dedicated to protecting children in and around motor vehicles. “There is a scientific reason why this is happening. It’s not that people don’t love their kids.”

David Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida who has studied the issue, said a child in the back seat could easily be forgotten. Habit memory can take over during the drive home from work, causing a person to forget to stop on the way for an important prescription. Police officers, he said, have forgotten their guns after laying them down on the toilet paper roll in public bathrooms, so it should not be surprising that parents forget their child in the back seat.

“The brain process is the same,” Dr. Diamond said. “All involve an interaction between our habit and conscious memory systems.”

General Motors and Nissan have introduced technologies that remind the driver that a child is in the back seat by analyzing door sequencing. If the rear door is opened before the car is started but not after it is turned off, a warning sounds. The GM reminder is standard or available on numerous 2017 models and will be offered on others for the 2018 model year. The Nissan system is standard on the 2018 Pathfinder and will be on other models in the future.

This technology does not meet the standard of the legislation, however, because it does not detect the presence of a child. Hyundai’s technology, which is scheduled for release on some 2019 models, can detect someone in the back seat.

Some companies that sell equipment to the auto industry have developed warning devices. One such system, the VitaSense, uses low-power radio to sense movement and breathing. The technology, developed in Luxembourg by IEE, a manufacturer of automotive sensors, can reportedly detect even a sleeping infant in a rear-facing child seat. If a child is detected after the vehicle has been turned off, it alerts the driver by several means, including flashing lights, beeps, and messages sent to cellphones and computers.

Ms. Fennell applauded independent efforts to produce a warning device but argued that the only real solution was legislation that required the technology in all new vehicles.

When she got an alert from her car that she had left her gas tank open, Ms. Fennell said, “I realized that while my car can tell me that, it can’t tell me if a child has been left in the back seat.”

“We get buzzers and warnings for everything,” she said. “How in the world do you not develop a reminder for what is indisputably the most important thing?”",Forgetting a Child in a Back Seat Can Kill.

The transit agency, which said it never considered making the ransom payment, reported that its network was not breached.","“Card clash” happens when a passenger waves a wallet or purse containing an Oyster card (in London) or a Ventra card (in Chicago) — and a credit or debit card enabled for near-field communication, a form of electronic transmission that lets a reader in the turnstile receive information about the card. The card reader does not know which card to read, the card from the transit agency or the credit or debit card, and it could charge a payment to the wrong card. Transport for London’s website says a passenger who falls victim to “card clash” could be charged two maximum fares — on the way in and again on the way out.

Officials say that should not happen in New York with the new system, which will be installed starting late next year. When the fare-reading devices for New York pick up more than one credit card signal, a screen will display a message telling the passenger to choose one. Depending on how often it happens, it could replace “Please swipe again” in the commuter lexicon of dread.

The transportation authority in New York will sell an as-yet unnamed card of its own for riders who choose not to use a smartphone or credit card. New York will also have another feature that London’s system uses: payment with a smartphone app, which security specialists say carries fewer security risks.

“I would worry more about turnstile jumping,” said Bruce Schneier, a security technologist who divides his time between Minneapolis and Cambridge, Mass. “If I have a phone in my hand anyway, I’d rather wave it at a reader than fish in my wallet for something else.”

He also said that New York would benefit by piggybacking on others’ experience. In other words, by not being the first to adopt the technology. “It feels like the system has been shaken out in a bunch of cities,” Mr. Schneier said, “and it feels much more convenient.”

Other data experts echoed the idea that modernizing New York’s fare-payment system involved balancing the risk of a catastrophic breach and the disclosure of passengers’ credit card information against moving millions of people around the city.

“Our infrastructure’s creaky,” said Mike Flowers, who oversaw data analytics for the Bloomberg administration from 2009 to 2013, and is now an executive at a data-technology company. “They’ve got to do something. If enabling far greater communication between rider and ride provider is part of the grease to the cogs of that currently creaky system, I think it’s a great idea and should move forward.”

He said the transit agency did need to be “mindful of the responsibility of getting that deeper reach into people’s day-to-day activity.”

Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the transit agency, called safety the “No. 1 priority, whether it’s transporting our riders or protecting their personal information,” adding that the agency and the companies it hired would safeguard passengers’ information “with the most stringent security standards and protocols.”

The company behind the new New York payment network, Cubic Transportation Systems — also the company behind the MetroCard — says its equipment processes $18 billion for transit operators around the world every year and has built layers of defense to minimize the risks. Its system encrypts data and transmits personal data like credit card numbers using a “token,” not the old-fashioned currency of the subway but a unique digital code generated by the system.

The president of Cubic, Matt Cole, said that the original Oyster Card in London, introduced in 2002, was cracked by researchers in Holland who set out to show it could be done. But in London, “there were zero applications” by hackers. He said that the company put in safeguards that would have called attention to anyone trying to use a fake card.

Transport for London, which operates the transit system, later switched to a more modern system “that has not had any vulnerabilities,” Mr. Cole said, but New York will get an even newer system based on banking industry standards. That, too, has been introduced in London, and, he said, there have not been hacking incidents there.

Still, Cubic is not immune to the perils of the information age. Last November, Cubic’s system in San Francisco was hobbled by a virus that affected 900 office computers at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The virus sent a message threatening to dump data stolen from the agency unless a ransom of about $73,000 in Bitcoin was paid.

Mr. Cole of Cubic said the company’s system was disconnected from the transit agency’s computers “out of an abundance of caution” to be certain the ransomware did not spread. The transit agency, which said it never considered making the ransom payment, reported that its network was not breached. That left open the possibility that the malware was activated through a link in an email.

Cubic expects more passengers in New York to wave smartphones more often than credit or debit cards. On the London Underground, contactless trips made with smartphones or with credit or debit cards now account for about 25 percent of the fares. At about 80 stations, including the one at Gatwick Airport, contactless payments outnumber Oyster Cards.

Data experts say that smartphones are less vulnerable to what Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, called “near-field mischief,” which involves credit or debit cards enabled for near-field communication, a technology that is more common in Europe than in this country.

“It’s like skimming,” she explained. The thieves are “looking to add money to their own cards. Stealing people’s identities is not the goal. There are easier ways of doing that.”

But “near-field mischief” remains a concern, as became apparent when she flew to Hong Kong recently for a conference of data experts. She said one of the experts who gave a presentation handed out Octopus cards, Hong Kong’s version of Oyster cards, along with protective sleeves that prevent thieves from siphoning money off the fare cards.","New Fare System Raises Security Concerns, but Officials Promise Safety",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/new-fare-system-metrocard-security-hacking.html

Morris Pearl in Democracy Journal:



“While the Trump tax plan is a long, complex series of changes to the tax code, the elimination of the federal estate tax ranks high among the most egregious ideas.”

Mr. Pearl is the chairman of the Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy individuals worried about economic inequality. He defends the estate tax, which the Trump administration is seeking to revoke in its plan. “Were every child to be able to succeed in this country regardless of their family circumstances, perhaps concern over concentrating wealth would be unfounded,” he writes. “That is unfortunately not the case.” Read more »

Justin Miller in American Prospect:

“Quietly, Republicans are also pushing a territorial taxation provision that would make it far easier for multinational corporations to avoid paying even a new 20 percent rate by providing further incentive to stash profits in offshore tax havens.”

Mr. Miller argues that a provision in the Republican tax plan will encourage corporations to shift their profits to overseas tax havens. Republicans want to move to a territorial system that mirrors how much of the world structures its corporate taxes — a system that does not tax foreign profits at all. However, Mr. Miller says he is unconvinced that Republicans will install adequate protections against corporations storing their profits in offshore tax shelters. If they were serious about this, he writes, they would “simply end the deferral of corporations’ foreign profits and tax them annually like domestic profit.” Read more »

Helaine Olen in The Washington Post:

“It’s already hard enough to make the American system of saving for retirement more difficult, confusing or disadvantageous for lower- and middle-income savers. But Republicans just might be on the verge of accomplishing this — all in an effort to game the budget process.”

Even though President Trump said on Twitter that there would be no changes to 401(k) plans, Ms. Olen explains, the issue is not as resolved as he would have you believe. On Wednesday, there were reports that the retirement savings plans were still up for negotiation. Ms. Olen argues that the problem is not just Mr. Trump’s shifting positions on the retirement accounts, but, more broadly, how willing Republicans are to toy with retirement plans “all in an effort to game the budget process.” Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Veronique de Rugy in Reason:



“The good news is that there’s a debate in Washington about how to make the tax code less destructive. The bad news is that lawmakers will be able to achieve much less than they otherwise could because of bad policy priorities.”

Ms. de Rugy, writing for the libertarian Reason, accuses Republicans of being fiscally irresponsible with their tax plan. She says she worries that “failing to restrain spending today while cutting taxes means that taxes will have to go up in the future to pay for larger deficits.” She adds that while it may be politically expedient, giving the middle class a large tax cut is counterproductive: “There’s very little economic growth to be expected from reducing the marginal tax rates on middle-income earners.” Read more »

Justin Fox in Bloomberg:

“I figure this is as good a time as any to run through what’s wrong with the 401(k), or at least what’s wrong with having made it a centerpiece of our country’s retirement savings system.”

Mr. Fox explains why the 401(k) tax break should not be “untouchable,” even if it is politically popular. Millions of taxpayers benefit from the plan, he writes, but far more get nothing from it. “If the idea is to actually reduce the tax deductions for retirement savings, not just shift them across time,” he argues, “it’s maybe not so crazy.” Read more »

Josh Barro in Business Insider:

“If you’re going to give a tax break for business income, you have to clearly define what’s a business and what’s just work. That’s surprisingly hard.”

Mr. Barro applauds the Republican goal of simplifying the tax code. However, he notes, one provision in the plan will complicate a lot of people’s taxes. The preferential tax rates for so-called pass-through businesses, which allow owners to be taxed on the income from their business, can be abused, or worse, put business owners at a disadvantage. The solution? “Don’t enact the tax preference in the first place.” Read more »

The House on Thursday narrowly approved a budget that Republican leaders and President Trump hope to use as a legislative vehicle to cut taxes. Very wealthy American families will be the biggest beneficiaries of these cuts while many in the upper middle class could actually see their taxes go up.

While Republicans still have not produced a detailed proposal, a tax framework they published last month and their public comments make clear that they are doing everything they can to enrich the 1 percent – a group that would receive 80 percent of the benefits, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

One change is getting a lot of attention: Republican leaders want to eliminate the state and local tax deduction. This would hurt many Americans, especially those who live in states like California and New York with high state and local taxes.

That group clearly includes many rich families, but more than half of this deduction benefited taxpayers with incomes of less than $200,000 in 2015, according to Government Finance Officers Association, which represents officials from local and state governments. Some of these people might do fine under the framework, but tax experts say many will clearly be hurt because their total itemized deductions exceed the new, higher standard deduction proposed by the framework – $24,000 for couples and $12,000 for singles.

Some Republican lawmakers are upset that party leaders are trying to eliminate the deduction. But others are happy to use the savings – about $1.3 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center – to help pay for their beloved tax cuts.

The constituents of many Republicans who voted for the budget use this deduction.

House Republican Leaders Paul Ryan Wisconsin 33% of tax filers in his district use the deduction Kevin McCarthy California 29% of tax filers in his district use the deduction Steve Scalise Louisiana 25% of tax filers in his district use the deduction Cathy McMorris Rodgers Washington 23% of tax filers in her district use the deduction Luke Messer Indiana 20% of tax filers in his district use the deduction Kevin Brady Texas 26% of tax filers in his district use the deduction House Democratic Leaders Nancy Pelosi California 38% of tax filers in her district use the deduction Steny Hoyer Maryland 48% of tax filers in his district use the deduction James Clyburn South Carolina 27% of tax filers in his district use the deduction Joseph Crowley New York 25% of tax filers in his district use the deduction Richard Neal Massachusetts 32% of tax filers in his district use the deduction

It is pathetic that GOP lawmakers would be willing to hurt the very people who put them in office. But the tax cutting obsession has never really been about doing what most voters want. Just 28 percent of people who are aware of the tax plan say they support it, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll; 41 percent oppose it and 31 percent don’t know what to think about it.",Who Does Benefit From the Tax Cut Anyway?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/26/opinion/tax-state-local-trump.html

What I started to realize with the new one is, once somebody has this heroic moment, this kind of savior moment, the danger then becomes: What are the limits to your heroism?

[Laughs] Occasionally. And I will say, occasionally it’s super embarrassing. They’re becoming teenagers now — they’re like 14 and 15 — and so of course there are girl issues and body issues. They want to know about girls or a little bit about sex. They’re hormonal teenage boys, and I get it, I was that way, too, but I don’t feel like it’s appropriate that I have those conversations with them. So I offer them little bits of advice and then generally go off and get a cup of coffee and wait until it dies down.

You’re like a cool uncle.

Sometimes when they get a little out of hand, I also am the guy who’s able to be on set saying, “All right, come on kids, let’s get down to work.” So in some ways I’m a cool uncle, and in some ways I’m like a nasty physics teacher.

Did you have any initial trepidation about playing a supporting role on a show focused on kids?

No, from reading the pilot I knew that Hopper was a great, great character that they would do justice to. One of the things going into Season 2 is there is a father aspect to Hopper, but I certainly didn’t want to become the dad on “Full House,” or whatever, who’s just a dad. Hopper gets to go do very heroic things, and he gets to have this relationship with Joyce — you get to see him as full-fledged human being, and that was really important to me.

You’ve said that you were once told that you were “too fat” to play the Blob. Now you’re playing a shirtless superhero. How hard is it to maintain a healthy body image as a man in Hollywood?

The interesting thing about my career is for years I was trying to do that thing of getting in shape and looking cool — I would look at myself in camera angles and think how my chin looked the best and all this stuff. And I really couldn’t get that much work.

Then “Stranger Things” came along, and I had to really reinvest and go back to acting class and say to myself, “O.K. I’m going to throw my heart and my soul into this piece.” And part of that was letting go of a lot of my narcissism. In that first scene [in Season 1], where he’s shirtless, I had wanted to get all in shape, and this acting coach was like: “Come on, this guy doesn’t work out. Play the character. Don’t play the five roles in front of the character, just play that actual character.”

And that was where things turned around for me. It was like, “Oh, people want to see real human beings,” and I’ve been cynical about that, and here I have this opportunity.

MONDAY PUZZLE — The crossword editor Will Shortz has called this period of time the “golden age of puzzles,” which makes it especially funny to me that a crossword puzzle then goes ahead and declares six of its own ages. It’s very meta, to use a colloquialism, and a decent start to our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Timothy Polin offers us a theme set of six words that all end in -AGE, and separates the suffix from the base word to make a new AGE, as it were. Mr. Polin manages to pack a lot of theme material comfortably within his grid.

For example, at 39A, the word BONDAGE is split into BOND AGE and clued as “Period known for its 007 movies?” Similarly, at 50A, the word COVERAGE is split into COVER AGE and clued as “Period when tribute bands thrived?” because tribute bands play covers of songs.

I liked this set, although the top entry, 17A’s ANCHORAGE, stood out to me as a place name in a set of nonplace name words. And we have OWIE crossing BOBO, which in itself is not an issue, but they are not great entries. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, I enjoyed seeing the debut of SAFE SPACE and am glad that it was not clued derogatorily.

LA BELLE SAUVAGE, by Philip Pullman. (Knopf, $22.99.) Pullman’s “His Dark Materials” trilogy, written nominally for young adults but just as suited to older ones, sold nearly 18 million copies, was translated into 40 languages, and was adapted for both stage and screen. “La Belle Sauvage” is the first volume of a new trilogy that starts before “His Dark Materials” begins and will continue, the author says, nearly a decade after it finishes. “It’s a stunning achievement, the universe Pullman has created and continues to build on,” our reviewer Sarah Lyall writes. “All that remains is to sit tight and wait for the next installment.”

TENEMENTS, TOWERS & TRASH: An Unconventional Illustrated History of New York City, by Julia Wertz. (Black Dog & Leventhal, $29.99.) Wertz has become a cult favorite for her graphic memoirs, which take on serious themes — her alcoholism and chronic illness — while leaving room for silly stoner humor. Her new book is a departure, focusing on her great love, New York. “It’s a passionate anatomy of the city,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes, “a book of dramatic streetscapes and hidden histories — mostly of infamous women, like the 19th-century celebrity abortionist Madame Restell, who catered to socialites and built her Fifth Avenue mansion a block away from a Catholic church, supposedly to taunt the faithful.”

RIGHTEOUS, by Joe Ide. (Mulholland, $26.) “Last year, Joe Ide became the best thing to happen to mystery writing in a very long time,” with his debut, “IQ,” our reviewer Janet Maslin writes. “He writes thumbnail descriptions that rival Elmore Leonard’s,” and “His dialogue, much of it unprintable here, has bite that puts him in the Winslow/Lehane league.” This follow-up again concerns Ide’s leading man, Isaiah Quintabe, this time investigating the death of his brother, who may not have been all he seemed. “Righteous,” like “IQ,” has “an ending that will make you hope for the arrival of another installment, pronto.”

During the debate that preceded their vote, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as “historic” and “happy,” or else “tragic” and a violation of Spain’s Constitution, perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.

Within an hour of the Catalan vote, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution, granting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy extraordinary powers to take direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, who may now be subject to charges of rebellion.

In a speech on Friday before the vote, Mr. Rajoy had said he had “no alternative” because Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist government had pursued an illegal and unilateral path that was “contrary to the normal behavior in any democratic country like ours.”

Undeterred by the government’s threat, and after a bitter debate, separatists in the Catalan Parliament passed a resolution to create “a Catalan republic as an independent state.” Most of the lawmakers opposed to independence walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote.

Since the region’s referendum on Oct. 1, Mr. Puigdemont had been squeezed in a tightening vice of his own creation, and seemed at times to contradict his own declarations as he squirmed for a way out.

On the one hand, the inexperienced, former small city mayor was trapped between demands from Catalan hard-liners to declare independence, and on the other by a stiffening response from a Rajoy government determined to preserve the nation’s constitution and territorial integrity.

Despite pleas for mediation, he and his region’s independence bid were shunned and condemned, not only by the Madrid central government but also European Union officials wary of encouraging similarly minded secessionist movements around the Continent.

European leaders made clear on Friday that they would not be recognizing Catalan independence and would support Mr. Rajoy, as leader of one of the bloc’s most important member states. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a Twitter post that “nothing changes” and “Spain remains our only interlocutor.”

Searching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections — which Mr. Rajoy has said he, too, wouldnow call within six months — in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia’s autonomy.

But Madrid would offer no guarantee that it would not clamp down on the region, Mr. Puigdemont said, as he immediately faced a revolt in his own ranks from secessionist die-hards who called him a traitor.

After hours of wavering on Thursday, he relented and threw the decision on independence to Catalan lawmakers, who took the fateful plunge on Friday.

Addressing the Catalan Parliament in Spanish, Carlos Carrizosa, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos, a party that opposes secession, told Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers that, far from creating a new Catalan republic, “you will go down in history for having fractured Catalonia and for sinking the institutions of Catalonia.”

In front of the assembly, he tore apart a copy of the independence resolution. “Your job is not to promise unrealizable dreams but to improve the daily lives of people,” he said.

Before the independence vote, Marta Rovira, a separatist lawmaker, told the assembly that “today we start on a new path” to build “a better country.” She added: “We are creating a country free of repression.”

Catalan lawmakers who voted for independence could face prosecution for sedition, or even rebellion.

Marta Ribas, a Catalan lawmaker, said that Madrid’s use of Article 155 was unjustified, but also argued that “it’s a mistake to respond to one outrageous act with another outrageous act.”

She added: “A declaration of independence won’t protect us from the 155, quite the contrary.”

In the streets outside Parliament in Barcelona, not far from a boisterous pro-independence rally, a few Catalans quietly expressed similar frustrations.

The Oct. 1 referendum did not give the Catalan government the legitimacy to vote to secede, said Federico Escolar, 53, a cafe owner.

“Most of the people who would have voted no did not participate,” Mr. Escolar said, while smoking a cigarette outside his cafe. “It was not a proper referendum. It was illegal.”

Walking into a nearby subway station, Christina Juana, a 38-year-old social worker, agreed.

“Neither Puigdemont nor the Catalan government knows exactly what the Catalan people’s opinion is,” Ms. Juana said.

Before the Catalan Parliament’s vote for independence on Friday, large crowds had gathered outside in anticipation of what they hoped would be a historic day for Catalonia.

Many were draped in flags as they watched the parliamentary debate on two large screens, cheering during speeches by pro-independence lawmakers and hissing those of their opponents. When proceedings hit a lull, the crowds cycled through a series of pro-independence chants.

“Spanish occupiers!” was one, a reference to the national police officers who tried to stop the Oct. 1 referendum by force. “Leave Catalonia!”

“I feel very, very happy,” said Emili Ara, a 79-year-old retired realtor, who said he had hoped for Catalan independence for most of his life, even in the days when the concept had little widespread appeal.

“The people living here, both those who voted yes and those who voted no, will be able to see their sons and grandsons enjoy a much better future,” he added.

The optimism of Mr. Ara and his family was not dented by the prospect of the Spanish government’s moving to take over administration of the region.

“We have to declare independence even if we end up with less autonomy than we have now,” said Eulalia Ara, Mr. Ara’s 39-year-old daughter. “We can’t continue in this situation because we are being repressed by the Spanish state.”

And even “if they steal our Parliament and our government,” said Jordi Ara, Mr. Ara’s 18-year-old grandson, “we will still have our beliefs!”

Elsewhere in the crowd, separatist protesters saw little problem with declaring independence even though less than 43 percent of voters had participated in the referendum.

“Two months ago, I would have said that 43 percent was not enough,” said Ester Romero, 25, a sales manager who had come to the rally after picking up her degree certificate.

In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.
Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue.
Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out.
Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.","“This was an idea that I had, where if we can teach young people not to take drugs,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s really, really easy not to take them.” He shared the story of his brother Fred, who he said had struggled with alcohol addiction throughout his life and implored Mr. Trump never to take a drink — advice the president said he had heeded.

“We are going to overcome addiction in America,” the president said.

The designation of a public health crisis, formally made by Eric D. Hargan, the acting health secretary, would allow for some grant money to be used to combat opioid abuse, permit the hiring of specialists to tackle the crisis, and expand the use of telemedicine services to treat people in rural areas ravaged by opioid use, where doctors are often in short supply.

Mr. Trump said his plan would include a requirement that federally employed prescribers be trained in safe practices for opioid prescriptions, and a new federal initiative to develop nonaddictive painkillers, as well as intensified efforts to block shipments of fentanyl, a cheap and extremely potent synthetic opioid manufactured in China, into the United States.

He also said he would act to suspend a rule that currently prevents Medicaid from funding many drug rehabilitation facilities.

“We cannot allow this to continue,” Mr. Trump said. “It is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction.”

Congressional Republicans as well as law enforcement and physicians’ groups said the president’s announcement was a crucial first step in building awareness about the opioid crisis and confronting its causes and devastating effects.

In a statement, Patrice A. Harris, the chairwoman of the American Medical Association’s opioid task force, described it as “a move that will offer needed flexibility and help direct attention to opioid-ravaged communities.”

“There is plenty of work ahead,” Dr. Harris added, “and the emergency declaration adds further urgency to this epidemic.”

But Democrats criticized Mr. Trump for what they characterized as a tepid response to an urgent calamity, arguing that his failure to request funding for the effort revealed a lack of seriousness about addressing the issue.

“America is hemorrhaging lives by the day because of the opioid epidemic, but President Trump offered the country a Band-Aid when we need a tourniquet,” said Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. “Instead of a commitment to emergency funding for our states and communities, President Trump offered empty words and half-measures.”

Andrew Kolodny, the co-director of opioid policy research at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, said that no emergency declaration would do much to alleviate the impact of opioids without a substantial commitment of federal money and a clear strategy for overhauling the way the country treats addiction.

“What we need is for the president to seek an appropriation from Congress, I believe in the billions, so that we can rapidly expand access for effective outpatient opioid addiction treatments,” Dr. Kolodny said in an interview. “Until those treatments are easier to access than heroin or fentanyl, overdose deaths will remain at record-high levels.”

Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to focus on the opioid crisis helped propel him to a crucial victory in New Hampshire’s primary last year. As president, he appointed an opioid commission in March, installing Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a rival for the Republican nomination who had championed the issue during the 2016 race, as chairman.

In July, the commission recommended that the president declare a national emergency — either under the Stafford Act, which would have allowed the allocation of Federal Emergency Management Agency funds, or the Public Health Service Act, the option Mr. Trump chose.

Although Mr. Trump called the opioid crisis a national emergency over the next month, he did not sign a formal declaration of the designation, and the idea ran into stiff resistance in his administration to making an open-ended commitment of federal funds to deal with an issue that has shown no signs of abating.

Administration officials argued that a national emergency declaration was not necessary or helpful in the case of the opioid crisis, and that the powers associated with a public health emergency were better suited to address the issue. They said the White House would soon send Congress a request for money to combat opioids, with the goal of including it in a year-end spending package.

Mr. Christie praised the president on Thursday for what he called “bold action” to address the opioid crisis, and said the commission would put forth a comprehensive plan next week.

Beyond the lack of funding, it is unclear how much impact the public health declaration will have in the short term, given that Mr. Trump has yet to name central players who would carry it out. That includes a “drug czar” to steer a broader strategy on opioids and a secretary of health and human services who would tailor policies and identify sources of funding.

Among the questions left unanswered by the president’s announcement is whether the Department of Health and Human Services will use its authority under the public health declaration to negotiate lower prices for naloxone, a drug that quickly counteracts the effects of opioid overdoses. Lawmakers and public health and anti-addiction organizations have argued that such a measure is crucial to expand access to the drug.

Jim Hood, a founder and the chief executive of Facing Addiction, who lost his 20-year-old son, Austin, to an accidental overdose five years to the day before Mr. Trump’s announcement, said he was grateful that the president took the time to talk about a crisis that had too often been ignored, but worried that his message missed the mark.

“That undercurrent that if all of you just decided not to do this, we’d be in a better place — I can tell you, my son did not decide that he wanted to become addicted, much less die,” Mr. Hood said. “We might have been much better served by framing this as a very serious illness, a very serious health issue.”",Trump Declares Opioid Crisis a ‘Health Emergency’ but Requests No Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html

Mather, 37, founded The Athletic with Adam Hansmann, 29. They worked together at Strava, an app and website for weekend warriors and elite competitors that calls itself the social network for athletes.

That experience, along with their frustration at the difficulty of finding high-quality sportswriting that wasn’t bogged down by pop-up ads, informed their big bet. They believe there are hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions, of enthusiastic sports fans willing to pay $60 annually — less with frequently offered discounts — for good reporting and writing, a clean app and no ads.

They have raised almost $8 million in venture capital funding and have recurring subscription revenue, ensuring the site won’t shutter soon. But the question everybody in sports media is asking is, What happens in three, five, seven years? Will The Athletic’s business model allow it to survive that long?

Newspapers are a classic example of a bundle. Subscribers might read just one section, but their subscription gets them the entire paper. Mather and Hansmann believe that sports is an undervalued part of that bundle, and that there are tens of thousands of sports fans in each city who don’t care about the other sections, and would rather jettison their subscription and pay for The Athletic instead.

“I think the sports page has carried local papers for a while, and they don’t treat it well,” Mather said.

After waiting nine months to debut its second local site, Toronto, and another five months for its third, Cleveland, the company planned to grow the number of local sites slowly, before tackling national ones. But that timeline was drastically altered after layoffs at ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Yahoo Sports, Fox Sports, Bleacher Report, Vice Sports and Vocativ this spring and summer put dozens of talented, well-connected journalists on the market.

“I’d say it’s probably the largest talent displacement in sports media ever,” Hansmann said.

The Athletic raised $5.6 million in venture capital financing in July to take advantage of the moment, adding to the $2.3 million seed round it raised in January.

“It was really hard to see everything that was happening in terms of the layoffs,” said Deepen Parikh, an executive at Courtside Ventures, one of The Athletic’s largest investors, “and knowing we really, genuinely had an opportunity to capitalize on it and not take it.”

The Athletic did not need to raise any financing, its executives said. Only one of the local sites, Toronto, breaks even — Chicago and the Bay Area and “a few smaller markets” are on track to do so by the end of the year, executives said — but most subscribers pay upfront for an annual subscription, so The Athletic had cash in hand to continue operations.

The company has wasted no time spending the new money. It started sites in Detroit, Philadelphia, the Bay Area and Minnesota, brought on the former Fox Sports writer Stewart Mandel to lead a national college football site and hired the former Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis to head up another for national college basketball.

Paul Fichtenbaum, a former top Sports Illustrated editor who had been working for The Athletic as a consultant, was hired to oversee the national sites and start a longform vertical, called Ink. “Building a company is exciting,” he said, but the “bigger opportunity to change an industry is really something that we all aspire to.”

Now the plan is to raise even more money soon, and to gain a foothold in every American and Canadian professional sports market within two years. “If there is a hockey, basketball, baseball or football team” in a city, Hansmann said, “that’s the starting point.”

It is that kind of ambition, in an industry that has sustained a decade of retrenchment, that has most of the sports media industry rooting for The Athletic’s success. Every writer knows he or she could be the next victim of a naïve pivot to video.

But Mather and Hansmann have displayed sharp elbows, and not everybody is happy with them. Newspaper sports editors have been left smarting after losing reporters to The Athletic — four writers for The Athletic Bay Area worked at the Bay Area Newspaper Group a few months ago. And then there is Dejan Kovacevic, a longtime Pittsburgh sportswriter who started DK Pittsburgh Sports, a subscription-based local sports site that in some ways is a model for The Athletic, three years ago.

In an email, Kovacevic said that Mather and Hansmann had approached him to be an adviser but that they couldn’t agree on compensation. The Athletic, he said, promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. Instead, The Athletic Pittsburgh hired a second writer away from DK Pittsburgh Sports recently. Kovacevic also said that Mather and Hansmann were unhappy when he sold a copy of his publishing platform to Greg Bedard, who launched a subscription sports site in Boston this summer, because they said it raised their cost of doing business.

Mather said that when The Athletic’s executives spoke with Kovacevic, they had no intention of expanding into Pittsburgh in the near term, and that he and Hansmann “only make ‘promises’ to our customers, employees, investors and partners.”

“We are doing great work,” Mather said. “We treat our writers really well, we pay them well, and we are doing amazing journalism. If someone has a problem with that, that’s on them.”

Mather and Hansmann also don’t hew to traditional — they would say antiquated — norms about the separation of business and advertising efforts, and are already cozier with the teams they cover than many outlets. They have an agreement with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, for instance, whereby Argonauts season-ticket holders can receive a trial subscription to The Athletic, paid for by the Argonauts.

Hansmann said The Athletic pulled no punches in its reporting on the Argonauts, while Mather suggested The Athletic could partner with teams on insider video or events in which subscribers go to the stadium early for exclusive access. Fichtenbaum said his understanding was that the Argonauts partnership was a one-off.

Similarly, many of The Athletic’s representatives sang the virtues of its digital presentation, which shuns banner ads. But Parikh, the investor, said, “Advertising has a very real opportunity down the road with The Athletic,” before adding that it would have to be “customer centric.”

Mather and Hansmann declined to disclose subscription numbers, but they have said Toronto, their most successful local site, has more than 15,000 subscribers. The national sites figure to boost local subscription numbers.

As The Athletic’s costs rise — it will soon need a bigger office, and the company is beginning to hire nonrevenue-generating support staff like accountants and human resources personnel — the company will seemingly need to attract casual sports fans. But Mather and Hansmann are not convinced.

“In a city like Chicago, there are 100,000 die-hard fans,” Mather said. “That is a very lucrative subscription business. There are over 100,000 die-hard fans of Chicago teams outside of Chicago,” he added, and he says they aren’t served well. “Bleacher Report is empty calories. SB Nation is empty calories. The newspapers are doing nothing.”

More journalists and investors will pay attention if The Athletic can get to the point that it can rely only on its own revenue, rather than having to turn to venture capital. Successful online media subscription products usually either cost hundreds or thousands of dollars annually and appeal to information-starved professionals — like The Information and Politico Pro — or have relatively inexpensive subscriptions that support relatively few writers — like DK Pittsburgh Sports and Stratechery.

While The Athletic aspires to be the Spotify or Netflix of sports media, the only media companies that have achieved scale with a relatively low price point (and the help of ads) are the very same newspapers The Athletic is intent on destroying.

Bleacher Report was the big sports media winner of the era when scale and online advertising revenue seemed like the future of media. It was rarely profitable and raised $40 million in venture capital funding before being bought by Turner in 2012 for about $175 million. According to skeptical media executives and investors interviewed for this article, something similar is most likely the best-case scenario for The Athletic.

Mather and Hansmann insist that they, and their investors, are in it for the long haul, and that the time is finally right for a subscription media product to go big. “The advertising business model does not align with quality,” Mather said. “It’s hot takes instead of objective analysis, it’s short-term instead of long-term, it’s serving sponsors instead of users, it’s thinking big instead of great.”

“It really comes down to the business model,” he added. “That is our core belief.”",Why The Athletic Wants to Pillage Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?","This year is the 65th anniversary of Aperture, which has shaped the conversation around photography through its magazine and books. Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Solvers are naturally curious when entries appear frequently or on the same day in different puzzles. Do constructors and editors really get together in secret, Oreo-fueled meetings to compare notes? Are repetitions committed deliberately, to send messages to puzzle solvers?

The answer is no, there aren’t enough Oreos in the world to make them do that. Any commonalities between puzzles, be they entries like OWIE or even an entire theme, are purely coincidental.

I bring this up because Damon Gulczynski, the constructor of today’s puzzle, explains in his notes below that a theme very similar to his own ran in The Wall Street Journal recently, and the truth is, these things happen all the time. It’s not because of laziness on the part of the constructor. More than one person can have the same great idea, and because editors work at different companies and don’t consult each other, sometimes identical entries or themes run close together.

Today’s puzzle by Mr. Gulczynski is a fresh, three dimensional take on an interesting topic.

You’d be surprised how often identity theft comes down to misplaced or stolen documents. A few receipts here, a bank statement there, and someone has enough information to apply for a credit card or a loan in your name.

The best way to go is using a cross-cut shredder, which slices paper two ways into small ribbons rather than long straight ones, which can be pieced back together like a puzzle by (very patient) nefarious actors.

Wirecutter recommends the Amazon Basics 12-Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder, which can also handle CDs and old credit cards.

Tools to Keep Those Cables Under Control

Even if you have a dedicated home office, working from home means cables all over (or under) your desk. Charging cables, keyboard and mouse cables, monitor cables, external hard drives and more. The solution? Velcro cable ties! They’re easy to remove and reapply whenever you need to move things around.

Wirecutter’s favorites — and mine — are Velcro One Wrap Thin Ties. A pack of 100 is only $10, and you can reuse them over and over.

And while you’re getting all of those cables in order, also think about picking up an extra laptop charger and charging cable. The last thing you want is to get home, open your laptop to work and realize you forgot your charger at the office or in another room.

Working from home often means peace and quiet (if you don’t have kids or pets interrupting you), but it also means checking in with the office occasionally via conference call or video chat. For those moments, you’ll need a solid USB headset with a good microphone so everyone at the office can hear you and good enough audio quality so you can hear them.

Wirecutter likes the Jabra UC Voice 550 Duo, which is light enough to wear for long periods, and also offers superior voice and sound quality. It’s also easy to set up: Just plug it in to your computer and it’s ready to use.

A Lap Desk, for Those Couch Working Sessions

I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that working from home sometimes means working in bed or working from the couch in front of the TV. (Call it an office perk.)

When the couch calls, just remember not to keep your laptop on your lap for too long. Some models can get hot enough to burn, and even if yours doesn’t, it can make you clammy and uncomfortable. Grab a lap desk instead: You get a stable work space for your laptop, and your legs get to breathe.

That is the type of performance that the Detroit companies must achieve to win over investors, who remain leery of the domestic manufacturers because of their roller-coaster financial histories.

It was just eight years ago that both G.M. and the former Chrysler needed bankruptcies and government bailouts simply to survive.

For its part, Ford weathered the last recession without the benefit of Chapter 11 or federal aid — but only after it borrowed heavily and sold off divisions to generate the capital it needed to stay alive.

Now all three manufacturers are committed to reining in costs, aligning production volumes with demand, and reducing unprofitable sales of slow-moving vehicles to corporate fleets and rental-car companies. The Chrysler half of the Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler has gone a step further by dropping most small and midsize passenger cars from its lineup.

Its focus on Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups helped Fiat Chrysler post record third-quarter earnings of about $1.1 billion, an increase of 50 percent over the same period a year ago.

The results drew praise from one analyst because of the company’s aggressive approach to maximizing shareholder value. “Fiat Chrysler has continued a relentless restructuring of its brand portfolio to de-emphasize areas where it couldn’t make money,” the analyst, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.

The earnings announcements this week were welcomed on Wall Street, with Ford’s shares gaining almost 2 percent on Thursday.

But attacking costs and shifting investment to more popular products may not be enough for automakers to sustain strong profits if market conditions continue to weaken.

Overall sales of new vehicles in the United States have fallen about 2 percent so far this year, after back-to-back record years. An overhaul or abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement — which is being renegotiated by the United States, Canada and Mexico — could also upset the delicate balance of production and parts manufacturing spread over the region.

Competition is also getting stiffer, as companies such as the Japanese automaker Nissan expand their S.U.V. lineups and underperforming automakers like the German giant Volkswagen rev up their expansion plans.

Still, the healthy profit reports out of Detroit are becoming a proof point that the major domestic carmakers are better prepared than ever for a longer-term downturn in demand.

Some of the biggest changes are underway at G.M., the nation’s largest automaker. The company has made major moves in recent months, such as selling its unprofitable Opel-Vauxhall unit in Europe. Moreover, G.M. slashed its third-quarter production in North America by about 25 percent to respond to weak demand for many of its passenger car models.

The company reported a loss of $3 billion for the quarter, mostly because it is still absorbing hefty charges for the sale of the European assets to the French carmaker PSA Group. But G.M. reported 8 percent profit margins on vehicles it did sell in its home market, and pledged to stay focused on selling fewer, but higher-priced, vehicles.

G.M.’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, told analysts on a conference call that the results demonstrated “the resilience of our core business” in the face of declining consumer demand. “This was a solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes,” he said.

But as overall sales in the United States continue to slowly erode, the companies must maintain discipline on production schedules and refrain from piling sales incentives on poor-performing models. “The market is more challenging than expected,” Mr. Stevens said.

Strong balance sheets are essential if the automakers are going to dedicate more spending and resources to expensive strategies for self-driving and electric cars. G.M., for example, is continuing to build on its acquisition of the software firm Cruise Automation in its efforts to put fully autonomous vehicles on the road.

The company recently acquired a small laser-imaging company to augment Cruise’s work on outfitting all-electric Chevrolet Bolts with the most advanced self-driving equipment. And G.M. is building more Bolts for autonomous-driving tests in New York and elsewhere.

Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, told analysts that the company was also looking at potential markets for self-driving vehicles outside the United States. “Absolutely, we are going to be looking globally,” she said.

And even Fiat Chrysler, which has been slow to join the race to develop autonomous vehicles, served notice that it was now in position to accelerate its self-driving program in partnership with the German automaker BMW and suppliers like Delphi and Intel.

“We’re not laggards here,” the company’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said on an analyst call. “We’ve just chosen our spot carefully before we started playing.”",Automakers Build War Chests to Finance a Self-Driving Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/business/detroit-automakers.html

MONDAY PUZZLES — If you make odd connections between things as I do, the crossword might bring out different things for you. Jennifer Nutt, who wrote today’s lovely Monday crossword, probably did not have this in mind when she created it, but her puzzle brought this up for me, so I’m going to tell you a story.

The first time I visited Cape Town, I took the ferry to Robben Island to see the prison — now a museum — where former South African president Nelson Mandela and many others who resisted the National Party during the apartheid era were held. It’s the kind of thing that is expected of first-time visitors (“Oh, you must go!”) and I’m a student of history, so I climbed aboard the boat and off I went.

Cape Town is a very windy city because of its location between the mountains and the sea, and on that day, the wind was working against the ferry as it made its way across the water. With no warning, a pod of humpback whales appeared in the water at the front of the boat, and skimmed over the water toward the island, almost as if to lead us in. When we slowed down, they would loop back and continue to guide us. It was a very touching sight, almost as if they were saying, “Follow us. There are secrets to be told here.” Once we were close to the shore, they dispersed and made their way back out to sea.

The tour, which is more a heartbreaking example of man’s inhumanity to man than a tourist trap curiosity, lasted about an hour and included talks by both former prisoners and the Afrikaaner guards who had held them captive. They had returned to educate mostly foreign visitors about a relatively recent period in history (1948 — 1994) where a nationalist government had succeeded in discriminating despicably against black Africans and criminalizing interaction between the races. There were also a surprising number of white South Africans in our group.

Mueller III, as he investigates Russian efforts to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. At least one participant at the meeting has already testified before a federal grand jury.

Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”

The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.

Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.

The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a massive fraud scheme involving Russian officials.

In his speech to Western academics at a Black Sea resort last week, Mr. Putin said that American authorities had ignored the allegations against Mr. Browder and his investors because the Ziff brothers were major political donors. “They protect themselves in this way,” he said.

A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment. Mr. Browder said the charges were concocted to discredit him and to undermine the Magnitsky Act sanctions.

How Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations made their way to the upper reaches of the Russian government, and then to Trump campaign, is a tangled tale. A former prosecutor for the Moscow regional government, Ms. Veselnitskaya lives and works in Moscow but has traveled frequently to the United States in recent years, partly to lobby against the Magnitsky Act.

She was also the lead defense lawyer in a civil fraud lawsuit brought by the Justice Department against a Russian firm in New York. The firm, which ultimately settled the case for about $6 million without admitting fault, was accused of using real estate purchases to launder a portion of the profits from the tax fraud that Mr. Magnitsky had uncovered. Mr. Browder provided much of the prosecution’s evidence.

While investigating Mr. Browder and his investors, Ms. Veselnitskaya unearthed what she considered evidence of a financial and tax fraud scheme. In October 2015, she took her findings about Mr. Browder and the Ziff brothers directly to Mr. Chaika, Russia’s top prosecutor and a man whom she has said she knows personally.

Mr. Chaika was highly pleased with her report, according to a former colleague of Ms. Veselnitskaya who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions.

In April 2016, Ms. Veselnitskaya teamed with Mr. Chaika’s office to pass the accusations to an American congressional delegation visiting Moscow. An official with the Russian prosecutor general’s office gave a memo detailing the charges — stamped “confidential”— to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is considered to be one of the most pro-Russia lawmakers in Congress and who heads a subcommittee that helps oversee U.S. policy toward Russia.

Ms. Veselnitskaya handed a nearly identical memo to Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas. She has said she also met with Mr. Rohrabacher then, although he said that he does not recall the encounter.

The next month, Mr. Chaika’s office described the alleged scheme on the prosecutor general’s website.

Precisely how Ms. Veselnitskaya ended up at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting to present her findings remains in dispute. She asked Aras Agalarov, a well-connected Russian oligarch who knows the Trump family to help her share her allegations with the Trump campaign, according to Mr. Agalarov’s attorney, Scott Balber.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

She may have told Mr. Agalarov that she had previously conveyed the same information to Mr. Chaika, Mr. Balber said. Mr. Agalarov’s son then enlisted his publicist, Rob Goldstone, to broker the meeting.

In emails to Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Goldstone wrote that a Russian prosecutor — an apparent reference to Mr. Chaika — had met with Mr. Agalarov and wanted to offer the Trump campaign official documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Goldstone described the proposed meeting as part of the Russian government’s effort to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and said a “government lawyer” would fly to New York to deliver the documents.

Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed Mr. Goldstone’s emails as “goosed-up.” Mr. Balber blamed miscommunication among those arranging the meeting. “Mr. Agalarov unequivocally, absolutely, never spoke to Mr. Chaika or his office about these issues,” he said.

Donald Trump Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer of information that might damage the Clinton campaign. “I love it,” he wrote in an email agreeing to meet the Russian lawyer.

Ms. Veselnitskaya came to Trump Tower with a memo that closely resembled the document that prosecutors had given to Mr. Rohrabacher in Moscow two months earlier. Some paragraphs were incorporated verbatim, according to a comparison of both documents, which were provided to The Times.

By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”

After the meeting came to light last summer, Ms. Veselnitskaya insisted it was “not related at all to the fact” that Donald Trump Jr. “was the son of the candidate.” But by last weekend, she was describing herself as a kind of whistle-blower who was trying to expose American political corruption.

Last week, she told Rossiya 24, the state television network: “Of course they don’t like it when somebody says, even in a friendly tone, ‘Guys, what is happening with you at home? Who is in charge of your politics? Who is paying these politicians, and for what?’”

In a follow-up television interview broadcast early this week, Mr. Chaika charged that Mr. Browder and the Ziffs had illegally used “Russian money” to lobby for the sanctions law.

Russian elites have been known to mount independent initiatives to curry favor with the Kremlin. But a number of well-known Russian analysts called it inconceivable that Ms. Veselnitskaya would have bypassed her own government to deliver what are now unmistakably official allegations to an American presidential campaign.

“Suburbicon,” a jaundiced, hard-sell comedy, wants you to know that the American dream was always a crock. This may not be news, even in the movie industry, which loves white-picket fences in principle but remains a gated community in fact. Still, every so often a filmmaker restates the case for the prosecution. The latest complainant is George Clooney, who in directing “Suburbicon” has turned back the clock to the 1950s for a story about the good old American days of prosperity and prejudice, of race hate and white people who are always just one clenched fist away from becoming a mob.

The title refers to the ticky-tacky Potemkin suburb where it all goes down. You know the place: It’s as American as apple pie and quiet desperation. It’s the post-World War II wasteland with the identical homes, lawns and faces that has been grist for critique and caricature, novels and movies, ever since suburbs were invented. In “Little Boxes,” a 1960s lament about conformity, Pete Seeger warbles about that sprawling wasteland, where all the “boys go into business and marry and raise a family.” That these little boxes look a lot like coffins gives his song the tenor of a dirge, one that “Suburbicon” delivers anew with cruel laughter, violent enthusiasm and acres of dark-wood paneling.

Matt Damon plays Gardner Lodge, some kind of executive who has his own office and secretary at work and a wife, Rose (Julianne Moore), and son, Nicky (a good, appealing Noah Jupe), at home. It all looks neat and tidy, especially Suburbicon, a planned community dotted with houses as square as Gardner’s sack suits and yards that look as if they’d been landscaped using a compass and protractor. There are a few midcentury modern flourishes, but the sheer, overriding, bland whiteness underscores that this entire world has been drawn along the antiseptic lines of a period sitcom like “Father Knows Best” rather than a riposte like “Mad Men.”

Video

The story opens just as the Mayerses, Suburbicon’s first black family, move into the area, an event the neighborhood treats as a collective home invasion. Women whisper and stare, men sputter and rage, and soon all their white faces have gone red. Before long, unneighborly clusters begin gathering around the family’s home, edging around the perimeter and transforming it into a kind of stage. And then the fences go up, and the clusters develop into a pack. The whispers morph into jeers, and the progressively, dangerously impatient crowd howls for the show to begin. Any resemblance to the audience watching “Suburbicon” is as intentional as it is obvious.

Mr. Clooney, who wrote the movie with Grant Heslov — reworking a script by Ethan and Joel Coen — has embraced symmetry as his guiding principle. Everything looks picture perfect in Suburbicon, and the story is so ordered that at first the movie seems to be a tale of two families, twinned peoples whose only sons dress alike and play catch in yards that face each other as if mirrored images. That there aren’t any movie stars in the Mayers family, though, is an early sign that all isn’t quite as balanced as it seems.

Mr. Zhao consulted his GPS and turned onto a long, curving off-ramp leading from State Route 1 toward U.S. Route 13.
Mr. Zhao, 56, later pleaded guilty to three counts of operating a vehicle causing death and received probation, Delaware court records show.
Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.","“Even today,” Gary R. Brown, the magistrate judge who oversaw the settlement of that crash, wrote in June, the victims were still grappling with “getting on with the difficult process of healing.”

The 50 passengers were from all over: India, Romania, Turkey, Ecuador, Australia as well as New York, New Jersey and California. They included students and sisters-in-law, single friends and married couples. Among them were newlyweds from Algeria.

The three-day excursion, arranged by E-World Travel & Tours, began in Manhattan with a stop planned in Niagara Falls. The tour was meant to head on to Washington and then to Philadelphia, but the bus broke down in upstate New York, forcing the passengers to wait for hours at a shopping mall until a replacement, a 1996 Setra, showed up.

The whirlwind nature of the trip was magnified by the tight schedule set by E-World and the breakneck pace kept by the Setra’s driver, Jinli Zhao, whose erratic driving had unnerved many passengers.

Mr. Zhao seemed irritated, angry, even rude, often rushing the passengers at rest stops, some of them later reported. At least once when a passenger returned late to the bus, Mr. Zhao began to drive away, as though he meant to leave them, one passenger told the police.

Mr. Zhao also seemed distracted behind the wheel. He would eat while driving, passengers recalled. He argued frequently with the tour guide and constantly downed energy drinks. And he was frequently on his cellphone, they said.

He veered near cars in adjacent lanes, accelerated dangerously and then stepped on the brakes, passengers said, cutting off other vehicles. He shifted lanes at such high speed that one passenger said he felt the bus swaying back and forth.

Photo

The tour guide, Allan Ge, told the passengers that Mr. Zhao had not slept in a while, Melis Seker, a Turkish college student who was then 19, later told the police. Mr. Ge told the group that “if the police ever stopped the bus and found that the driver had not had enough sleep, then they would be forced to stay and rest,” Ms. Seker said.

The crash occurred on a stretch of roadway in Delaware that investigators said the driver was unfamiliar with. Confronted with traffic on Interstate 95, he and Mr. Ge decided to take a different route. Mr. Zhao consulted his GPS and turned onto a long, curving off-ramp leading from State Route 1 toward U.S. Route 13.

As they pulled onto the ramp, several people stood up and shouted for the driver to slow down, one passenger told the police. When the bus began to tip, luggage tumbled from the overhead racks. People started screaming.

An Algerian man, Karim Fellahi, who was with his wife, Ihssene Kerchouche, on their honeymoon, remembered seeing the driver lose control.

“I just had the time to say to Ihssene, ‘Be ready for the impact,’” Mr. Fellahi, 36, testified, “because we were sure that we are going to die. We closed our eyes and we waited to die.”

The bus was off the road now, careening into a sloping area of bushes. It went upside-down, turned on its roof and skidded partway down a grassy embankment, rolling again and landing with a shudder on the driver’s side.

Moments later, Mr. Fellahi said, he opened his eyes to a barely identifiable structure. “I couldn’t recognize the roof,” he said. Ms. Kerchouche, 29, had disappeared; even her seat was gone.

“I heard her screaming my name,” Mr. Fellahi said. “It was like she was far, very far, from me.”

He found his wife outside the bus, facedown in the dirt and covered by other passengers. Her mangled right forearm was dangling, connected to the rest of her arm by a piece of skin.

Another passenger testified that she and her sister were propelled through the air at the moment of the crash, flying forward and slamming into people and broken bus parts.

She could not move her arms or legs and felt an unbearable pain in her pelvis, which had been fractured by a large piece of metal.

The Delaware State Police arrived to a scene of carnage: a twisted metal shell and dozens of bodies strewn around it. A 400-foot-long trail of tire marks streaked across the road.

As passengers struggled to escape, Eyup Bahsi, a 30-year-old Turkish man, looked in vain for his wife, Idil. Also 30, she had been sitting in the window seat beside him. Mr. Bahsi finally found her, conscious and seated with her legs pinned underneath the bus. She was trying to pull herself free.

Ms. Bahsi was also having trouble breathing, Mr. Bahsi said, and he gently helped her lie on her back. He tried to clear her mouth of dirt.

She squeezed his hand, opened and closed her eyes and tried to speak, but Mr. Bahsi said that he could not make out the words. He sought to reassure his wife, telling her to just stay calm, that an ambulance was on its way. Ms. Bahsi eventually reached a hospital, where she underwent several operations. She died later that night.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the crash was excessive speed. Mr. Zhao, the driver, claimed that he was feeling ill before the crash and had “blacked out.” But the safety board said that the evidence suggested he was not incapacitated.

The board eventually determined that Mr. Zhao had driven a total of 14¾ hours that Saturday, exceeding the 10-hour federal limit. He also did not have the requisite eight hours off before he set out on the road again.

The board found that the driver’s cellphone records showed he was routinely making and receiving calls and was using his voice mail when the bus was moving, although not when it crashed.

Mr. Zhao, 56, later pleaded guilty to three counts of operating a vehicle causing death and received probation, Delaware court records show.

This month, when a reporter visited his apartment in Queens, Mr. Zhao loomed silently in the background as a young man, who did not give his name but said he was Mr. Zhao’s son, stood in the doorway. He said his father was so “scarred” by the crash that he hardly spoke of it, even to his family.

“What’s past is past,” the son added.

During the litigation, Mr. Zhao was deposed by victims’ lawyers. He testified that when he arrived from New York to fetch the tour group in the Setra, he informed the guide, Mr. Ge, that he was already “very tired.” Mr. Zhao said he had explained to Mr. Ge that if they kept to their plan, his hours would be “a lot over the limit.” He said that Mr. Ge responded there was “nothing he could do.”

In an interview, Mr. Ge said that he did not recall Mr. Zhao looking “really tired.” An E-World supervisor, David Lo, described the travel agency as “an innocent victim” in the crash. “We cannot control the driver,” Mr. Lo said. “We cannot control the bus company.”

The bus was insured for $5 million — the minimum required by law. The insurers filed court papers saying they anticipated that the claims from the crash would exceed their policies, and they ultimately deposited the full $5 million with the court and left Judge Brown to allocate it.

Lawyers for the victims said that this approach, while hardly ideal, was nonetheless their best chance to compensate their clients. The lawyers had learned that AM USA Express had sold its remaining three buses and gone out of business; E-World, they said, also had few assets.

The process was designed to avoid a lengthy court fight, but because the pool of money was limited, it meant that if some passengers got more, others would get less. “On a certain level, it’s a zero-sum game,” said Brian M. Levy, a lawyer for 21 of the claimants.

In order to understand the impact of the crash, Judge Brown held two days of investigative hearings in April. What had previously been a dry legal matter suddenly became excruciatingly human.

Around 10:30 a.m. on April 26, several of the victims — some having traveled from continents away — filed into the courtroom in Central Islip, N.Y. Judge Brown had set out boxes of tissues, and as the day went on, he stopped the proceedings several times to apologize.

“I understand this was a horrific event,” he said, “and we’re going to do everything we can to get you through this as painlessly as possible.”

The first witness was Shilpa Lagishetty, who told the judge that she had suffered a traumatic injury to her right eye socket. Even after surgery, Ms. Lagishetty said, she had constant headaches and could no longer see things that were more than two feet away.

There had also been an emotional toll. “I still have sleepless nights,” she said. On the morning of the crash, she recounted, a woman had asked her to swap seats; she did. The woman died in the crash, she said, beginning to cry.

“I’m so depressed,” she added. “That lady had a son. I can’t imagine me in that position.”

Addressing the judge next was Mr. Bahsi, who had flown to New York from Turkey. He spoke through an interpreter, recounting how his wife had been trapped beneath the bus and died that night in the hospital.

“She was my everything,” he said, “and she was my best friend and she was my best companion.” He added: “It’s difficult. It’s — you know, to come as two individuals and to go back basically with a coffin.”

The next to testify were the Algerian honeymooners, Ms. Kerchouche and Mr. Fellahi. After the crash, Ms. Kerchouche had numerous surgeries as doctors struggled to repair her right arm, which had suffered extensive nerve and vascular damage, and her other injuries. She ultimately faced several hundred thousand dollars in medical bills. Unable to travel, she and Mr. Fellahi had to stay in the United States for more than four months as she recovered. Ms. Kerchouche, who worked for a bank, could not return to work.

Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy. But she could not hold her child, she testified, because one of her arms was permanently locked at a 90-degree angle. Nor could she write, drive a car or turn a door handle, she said. In time, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic-stress disorder.

“She’s like living, but dead in the same time,” her husband told the judge.

Ms. Seker, the Turkish college student, was unable to come to court, but she sent a letter to her lawyer, Jordan K. Merson, who read it to the judge. In the letter, Ms. Seker said the crash’s impact on her life had been endless. She was in constant pain — the crash broke both of her shoulders and some of her ribs, and she was left with a collapsed lung and other fractures. She had nightmares and was now afraid to sleep.

“Sometimes,” she wrote, “I wake up and feel like I am being thrown, like I was on the bus.”

In a recent interview, Ms. Seker said that before the crash, she had been training to be a competitive swimmer and also loved playing volleyball. Now she cannot engage in either sport.

“They said probably I will never be able to do them again,” she said. Like Ms. Kerchouche, she had also stayed in the United States for more than a month to recover, in her case forcing her to miss a semester of school.

In the courtroom, Judge Brown appeared perplexed by the challenge of comparing these cases.

“How do I do this?” he asked Ms. Seker’s lawyer, Mr. Merson. The judge cited Ms. Kerchouche’s case, mentioning her damaged arm. “She can’t hold her baby,” he said. “She can’t feel anything.”",‘Everyone Lost Something’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/bus-crash-underinsured-victims-compensation.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

The Alexander-Murray legislation would make it easier for states to meet Section 1332’s affordability requirement, expedite the review of waiver applications and create an automatic approval process for waivers that mirror previously approved ones from other states. These changes, while laudable, do not fundamentally reform the state-innovation-waiver process to empower states and help them engage in the type of bold reforms that could benefit both red and blue states.

There are two ways to make more dramatic improvements to Section 1332 as part of a deal on subsidies.

First, lawmakers can give states greater flexibility on the scope of health benefits that plans must provide. The law now requires that state waivers establish plans to provide coverage that is as “comprehensive” as that provided for under the law’s essential health benefits requirement. But some states may wish to mandate coverage of a different set of benefits than that specified, or choose to minimize the benefits that plans are required to cover. It is unclear, at best, whether this would be permissible under current law. Congress could either clarify what is meant by “comprehensive” in Section 1332 or, more helpfully, simply specify that states have greater flexibility in determining the benefits that must be covered.

These changes would not permit states to eliminate the A.C.A.’s protections for those with pre-existing health conditions nor allow them to introduce differential pricing for health plans based on health status.

Second, Congress can make it easier for states to put their own reform plans into effect and narrow the discretion given to the administration to approve or deny waiver applications. Lawmakers could do this by deeming waiver applications presumptively valid, so long as they certify that a similar number of people will be covered and at a comparable level of affordability as under the law and that the state reforms will not increase the federal deficit. This would apply regardless of whether an application comes from a progressive or conservative state. Vermont, for example, considered a Section 1332 waiver to install a single-payer health system but stopped because it could not come up with a funding mechanism to support the plan.

Federal authorities would then be responsible for evaluation of the state’s reform plan as soon as six months after the waiver is approved and on an as-needed basis thereafter. States not meeting thresholds of affordability or the number of people covered would then be required to adjust their reforms accordingly.

We are on the cusp of a rare health care bipartisan agreement. Still, conservatives will (and should) insist on fundamental reforms to Obamacare as part of the deal. In so doing, they should aim for an approach that will truly give more states the opportunity to become what Justice Louis Brandeis once called the “laboratories of democracy.”",How Republicans Can Make a Deal on Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/how-republicans-can-make-a-deal-on-health-care.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.","Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centra’s founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world. They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.

Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year’s total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.

Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O. boom. The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens — Centra, Stox and Hubiits — has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.

But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.

“It’s undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. “But I’m not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects. I worry they are bringing attention to the scams.”

Coins of the Digital Wild West

The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token — with no physical backing — that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.

Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum. People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.

Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks — like the next generation of the internet.

But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.

The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company’s chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.

The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built. Mr. Trapani’s old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.

“You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!” he wrote in one post.

The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centra’s founders. In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.

“Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world’s first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,” the announcement said.

Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.

The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up. The photo on Centra’s website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra — and none of the details on Mr. Edward’s LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.

Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company’s marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted.

The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.

“When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,” Mr. Sharma said in an interview.

Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company’s site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.

There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.

After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.

But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.

“Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,” Mr. Gendron said.

Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company’s credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.

Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn’t own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.

The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla. who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.

“He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,” Mr. Fern said. “It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.”

Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was “a kid.”

He said the landlord’s statements were “not accurate.”

Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati

For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.

The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati. According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had “a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.”

Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma’s trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.

“As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,” the indictment said.

Mr. Sharma said that he couldn’t speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.

“I’m obviously not comfortable with that situation,” he said. “But it’s not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.”

He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.

Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra’s technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.

“He’ll do anything we ask,” Mr. Trapani said. “He’ll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.”

The boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid.

After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.

Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather’s spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. “We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,” Mr. Sharma said. “It was a very direct, individual deal.”

Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.

Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.

In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: “Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!” Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.

Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project — a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.

For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.

Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.

Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything. But they say that won’t happen.

Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.

“I see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,” Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. “Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.”

Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma’s enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.

“What’s important is Centra is being endorsed and they have a product,” a Reddit user named islandsurf wrote back to the critics, explaining his own investment. “That’s what matters to investors!”",How Floyd Mayweather Helped Two Young Guys From Miami Get Rich,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/technology/how-floyd-mayweather-helped-two-young-guys-from-miami-get-rich.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, whom Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people, apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly set child advocates’ hair on fire. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s who we are turning our backs on first.

Lesli is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state tuition. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she says, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who crawls into bed with Lesli when she wakes herself up screaming with nightmares — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Lesli is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Lesli and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress scrap a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers, and they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent — a remedy that has been the most successful path to legalize these children.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian are allowed into the United States and spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes as authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a border patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that border patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have failed to identify hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that border patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration partially canceled a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. Some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the address and name of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

In the midst of all of this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, says Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally. But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are standing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

Dreamers, despite having the most to lose, have been most adamant in rejecting Trump’s proposals. “It’s a white nationalist racist wish list,” says Cristina Jiménez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream.","To Help a Dreamer, Why Do We Have to Hurt Her Cousin?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/dreamers-children-immigration-congress.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

House Republicans, over Mr. Trump’s public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year.
A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts.
In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings.
But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.","Democrats were swift to criticize the approach, saying it was an attempt to hide tax changes that will hurt, not help, middle-class families. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be “a bunch of false promises to the middle class.” Republicans, he said, “know the details — the specifics of what they’re really about — will be hard to argue in the sunlight.”

Lawmakers and committee staff members must still resolve some of the thorniest issues before they can release a bill, including where to draw income lines for tax brackets, how high to set the top personal income tax rate and how to ensure that major changes to the way that multinational corporations are taxed do not encourage them to shift more money overseas. The biggest question is how to offset enough tax revenue that will be lost from cutting rates to remain within the rules of the Senate budget reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster.

The budget measure approved on Thursday would allow for a tax bill that adds as much as $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, at a time when the federal government’s debt has already topped $20 trillion. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

The outline of the tax plan unveiled in September would cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent; collapse individual income tax brackets from seven to three or four, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, and possibly one higher; and nearly double the standard deduction, to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly.

The budget measure passed over the loud protests of House members from New York and New Jersey, who worry that the blueprint will doom the current deduction for state and local taxes — a benefit of great importance to taxpayers in their states. Eleven of the 20 Republicans who voted no were from those two states.

“This isn’t over,” one of those lawmakers, Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, a Republican, said after the vote. “I am confident we’ll reach an agreement. And if we don’t, then I don’t see how we can move forward.”

Mr. Brady told reporters later in the day that while no such agreement had yet been reached, it would eventually be resolved, since families in New York and New Jersey needed to be “better off” after a tax bill passes.

“This is a serious issue, and we’re taking it seriously,” Mr. Brady said. Republican lawmakers from those states “made it clear they need this problem solved before they vote yes on tax reform,” he added.

Democrats were quick to seize on the discord. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had put his party’s control of the House at even greater risk through his “foolish decision to force his most vulnerable members to walk the plank on a toxic tax increase.”

“Anybody who votes for this thing should have their head examined if they live where we do,” said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York.

In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, President Trump and Mr. Brady have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate matter.

House Republicans, over Mr. Trump’s public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year. On Thursday, Mr. Brady hinted that the bill may raise the limit on the total amount Americans can save in tax-preferred accounts but shift the tax preference to the back end, so that a larger share of those contributions are taxed up front, instead of when they are withdrawn, as is the case with 401(k) plans.

Such a change would produce more tax revenues in the short term, at the expense of the long run, which would help Republicans make their tax math work. One possible reason to consider that change would be to offset revenues lost from a deal to preserve some of the state and local deduction for individuals.

A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings. The House’s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit. But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.

House Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.

Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome, but she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.

“President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly,” she said.

And while Republicans expressed cautious optimism that they could resolve their differences, avoid lobbying pitfalls and deliver the bill to Mr. Trump for his signature in December, Democrats warned that the ride could be rough.

“It’s easy to understand why they want to rush a bill like this through, because the more people see it, the less they’ll like it,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat. “It’ll be a lot tougher for them to get it done than they think.”","House Passes Budget Blueprint, Clearing Path for Tax Overhaul",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/house-budget-blueprint-tax-cut.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

There is the bumbling repetition of interview questions, because no one seems to be able to hear anything over the screaming audience members. There is the smoke that engulfs guests as they enter, and that in a few cases has left them disoriented. And there is the occasional paternal pat on the shoulder the guests give the hosts, a gesture of dominance and control, the sort of thing an elder does to let the youth know to turn it down a notch.

The seams are visible, and frayed, on “TRL,” which is currently in its fourth week and no steadier than it was in its first. In its initial incarnation, which ran from 1998 to 2008, “TRL” — originally “Total Request Live” — was the essential countdown show of the teen-pop era. It took place after school and often filled the streets of Times Square with shrieking teenagers.

But that was when the phone screen was less enticing than the television screen, when music was closer to the heart of MTV’s mission.

The “TRL” of 2017 is less a coherent show than a series of loosely threaded distractions. Each episode is an hour but feels like two. It is preoccupied with viral moments but creates none of its own, or barely anything even worth a GIF. (One exception: the recent sketch that found DJ Khaled break dancing and dropping to the floor for a backspin.)

The fact that the internet has leached attention and relevance away from television is only part of what’s befuddling this show — plenty of television is premised on digesting and commenting on things that happen online. But those shows — say, “Desus & Mero,” or even late-night talk-show monologues — specialize in personalities and commentary. “TRL” is a mishmash and has the additional problem of trying to build a tentpole television series out of the component parts of internet personalities, who are generally poorly suited to the task.

That’s true of the musical guests, many of whom found fame online and aren’t kiln-fired in the glare of camera lights. An interview with the young rap star Lil Uzi Vert elicited about a couple dozen words from him. Playboi Carti looked somnolent during his performance. When actual famous people, like Fifth Harmony, Ed Sheeran or Pitbull, showed up, their professionalism was almost disruptive. On the episode when Jhené Aiko spoke of keeping a journal after the death of her brother, it was as if the channel had flipped.","‘TRL’ Is Back on MTV, but Undone by the Internet",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/arts/music/trl-total-request-live-mtv.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at New York’s Leica Gallery. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted.
Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago.
Photo“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said.
“These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty.","Silent clues to a violent past are buried among the scores of mass graves that dot Chungui district in the mountainous Ayacucho region of Peru. There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

Photo

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

Photo

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

During the debate that preceded their vote, Catalan lawmakers traded accusations and in turn described the occasion as “historic” and “happy,” or else “tragic” and a violation of Spain’s Constitution, perhaps the only thing on which both sides agreed.

Within an hour of the Catalan vote, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted 214 to 47 to invoke Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution, granting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy extraordinary powers to take direct administrative control over the region and remove secessionist politicians, including the Catalan leader, Carles Puigdemont, who may now be subject to charges of rebellion.

Photo

In a speech on Friday before the vote, Mr. Rajoy had said he had “no alternative” because Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist government had pursued an illegal and unilateral path that was “contrary to the normal behavior in any democratic country like ours.”

Undeterred by the government’s threat, and after a bitter debate, separatists in the Catalan Parliament passed a resolution to create “a Catalan republic as an independent state.” Most of the lawmakers opposed to independence walked out of the chamber in protest before the vote.

Since the region’s referendum on Oct. 1, Mr. Puigdemont had been squeezed in a tightening vice of his own creation, and seemed at times to contradict his own declarations as he squirmed for a way out.

On the one hand, the inexperienced, former small city mayor was trapped between demands from Catalan hard-liners to declare independence, and on the other by a stiffening response from a Rajoy government determined to preserve the nation’s constitution and territorial integrity.

Despite pleas for mediation, he and his region’s independence bid were shunned and condemned, not only by the Madrid central government but also European Union officials wary of encouraging similarly minded secessionist movements around the Continent.

European leaders made clear on Friday that they would not be recognizing Catalan independence and would support Mr. Rajoy, as leader of one of the bloc’s most important member states. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, wrote in a Twitter post that “nothing changes” and “Spain remains our only interlocutor.”

Searching for a compromise, Mr. Puigdemont came close on Thursday to calling early regional elections — which Mr. Rajoy has said he, too, wouldnow call within six months — in hopes of forestalling the drastic measures approved by the Spanish Senate on Friday and preserving Catalonia’s autonomy.

But Madrid would offer no guarantee that it would not clamp down on the region, Mr. Puigdemont said, as he immediately faced a revolt in his own ranks from secessionist die-hards who called him a traitor.

After hours of wavering on Thursday, he relented and threw the decision on independence to Catalan lawmakers, who took the fateful plunge on Friday.

Addressing the Catalan Parliament in Spanish, Carlos Carrizosa, a lawmaker from Ciudadanos, a party that opposes secession, told Mr. Puigdemont and separatist lawmakers that, far from creating a new Catalan republic, “you will go down in history for having fractured Catalonia and for sinking the institutions of Catalonia.”

In front of the assembly, he tore apart a copy of the independence resolution. “Your job is not to promise unrealizable dreams but to improve the daily lives of people,” he said.

Before the independence vote, Marta Rovira, a separatist lawmaker, told the assembly that “today we start on a new path” to build “a better country.” She added: “We are creating a country free of repression.”

Catalan lawmakers who voted for independence could face prosecution for sedition, or even rebellion.

Marta Ribas, a Catalan lawmaker, said that Madrid’s use of Article 155 was unjustified, but also argued that “it’s a mistake to respond to one outrageous act with another outrageous act.”

She added: “A declaration of independence won’t protect us from the 155, quite the contrary.”

In the streets outside Parliament in Barcelona, not far from a boisterous pro-independence rally, a few Catalans quietly expressed similar frustrations.

The Oct. 1 referendum did not give the Catalan government the legitimacy to vote to secede, said Federico Escolar, 53, a cafe owner.

“Most of the people who would have voted no did not participate,” Mr. Escolar said, while smoking a cigarette outside his cafe. “It was not a proper referendum. It was illegal.”

Walking into a nearby subway station, Christina Juana, a 38-year-old social worker, agreed.

“Neither Puigdemont nor the Catalan government knows exactly what the Catalan people’s opinion is,” Ms. Juana said.

Before the Catalan Parliament’s vote for independence on Friday, large crowds had gathered outside in anticipation of what they hoped would be a historic day for Catalonia.

Photo

Many were draped in flags as they watched the parliamentary debate on two large screens, cheering during speeches by pro-independence lawmakers and hissing those of their opponents. When proceedings hit a lull, the crowds cycled through a series of pro-independence chants.

“Spanish occupiers!” was one, a reference to the national police officers who tried to stop the Oct. 1 referendum by force. “Leave Catalonia!”

“I feel very, very happy,” said Emili Ara, a 79-year-old retired realtor, who said he had hoped for Catalan independence for most of his life, even in the days when the concept had little widespread appeal.

“The people living here, both those who voted yes and those who voted no, will be able to see their sons and grandsons enjoy a much better future,” he added.

The optimism of Mr. Ara and his family was not dented by the prospect of the Spanish government’s moving to take over administration of the region.

“We have to declare independence even if we end up with less autonomy than we have now,” said Eulalia Ara, Mr. Ara’s 39-year-old daughter. “We can’t continue in this situation because we are being repressed by the Spanish state.”

And even “if they steal our Parliament and our government,” said Jordi Ara, Mr. Ara’s 18-year-old grandson, “we will still have our beliefs!”

Elsewhere in the crowd, separatist protesters saw little problem with declaring independence even though less than 43 percent of voters had participated in the referendum.

“Two months ago, I would have said that 43 percent was not enough,” said Ester Romero, 25, a sales manager who had come to the rally after picking up her degree certificate.

“But after all the oppression, after all the police hitting people during the referendum, it’s enough.”",Spain Moves to Take Control of Catalonia After Secession Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/europe/spain-catalonia-puigdemont.html

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Photo

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

Photo

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Photo

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

And the Jews, lo and behold, are still around, still worrying, still making trouble and laughing, like Shagrir. Day after day peace is still dying, but not yet dead, between Israelis and Palestinians. Nothing dies easily these days.

So there is hope and cause to celebrate and be thankful. America is still “this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent country,” as Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, put it the other day; and the world’s anti-American elites still cry out: “Yankee, go home — and take our baby with you!”

Lament grows tiresome, as does a very high and righteous moral tone. Life is a curve, not a straight line. Of all the virtues, surely stoicism, decency and forgiveness rate near the top — particularly in a culture of facile complaint, indecent vanity and vindictive piling-on. Silence seems to me a near-forgotten quality.

But I could be wrong. That is always a possibility, and, in this line of work, a very public one.

Then there is the consolation of unintended consequences. Take the British referendum vote to leave the European Union. This was an extraordinary, voluntary act of self-harm from a country previously more renowned for pragmatism than over-the-cliff auto-propulsion. No word existed for such odd behavior so one had to be invented: Brexit.

This, in turn, has given rise to the need for a dictionary definition. This one appears on inktank.fi: “The undefined being negotiated by the unprepared in order to get the unspecified for the uninformed.”

It’s not over yet.

And again, when it comes to unintended consequences, there’s the real possibility that Germany will end up with a foreign minister named Cem Ozdemir after elections last month that were marked by a strong showing by the rightist, xenophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Ozdemir, who is of Turkish descent, is a leader of the Green Party, now in coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel. I know Ozdemir, who was born into a working-class family and is a man of principle. He would be the perfect rebuke to the AfD.

I mentioned the revival of oratory. Here is Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, explaining his decision not to run again for his seat: “We must never regard as ‘normal’ the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals. We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country — the personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms and institutions, the flagrant disregard for truth or decency, the reckless provocations, most often for the pettiest and most personal reasons, reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with the fortunes of the people that we have all been elected to serve.”

Mr. Trump, who has indulged in his own wild speculation about the sensational killing, had expressed eagerness to finally open the last of the government files, only to run into a last-minute campaign by intelligence agencies to redact certain documents. Grudgingly, he gave the agencies until April 26 to go through the remaining papers again and make their case.

“I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” Mr. Trump said in a memo to the agencies. Given their objections, he said, “I have no choice — today — but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation’s security.” But he ordered the agencies to “be extremely circumspect,” noting that the rationale for secrecy has only “grown weaker with the passage of time.”

For conspiracy theorists, the Kennedy assassination has been the holy grail, one that has produced an endless string of books, reports, lectures, articles, websites, documentaries and big-screen Hollywood movies. It was the first murder of an American president in the television age, touching off a wave of global grief for a charismatic young leader while also spawning a cottage industry of skeptical questioning of the official version of events.

Every government authority that has examined the investigation of his death, from the Warren Commission to congressional investigators, concluded that Kennedy was killed by Oswald, who fired three shots with a mail-order rifle from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository when the presidential motorcade passed by on Nov. 22, 1963. But that has never satisfied the doubters, and polls have consistently shown that most Americans still believe that someone other than Oswald must have been involved.

While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said in a 1979 report that Kennedy “was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy” but did not identify who those conspirators might have been. It ruled out the Soviet and Cuban governments, organized Cubans opposing Fidel Castro, the Mafia, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Secret Service, although the committee said it could not preclude that individuals affiliated with some of those groups might have been involved.

Among the doubters have been Mr. Trump, who last year alleged that the father of one of his Republican presidential primary rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the assassination. The president’s longtime friend and adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. wrote a book accusing Johnson of being responsible for the shooting that elevated him to the presidency.

As it happened, Mr. Trump’s deferral to the C.I.A. and F.B.I. invariably will lead to suspicions that the government is still protecting sensational secrets about the case. Administration officials said there was no cover-up, just an effort to avoid compromising national security, law enforcement or intelligence gathering methods.

The C.I.A., which for years has borne the brunt of suspicions from amateur assassination theorists, went out of its way on Thursday to try to dispel concerns that it was hiding important evidence.

The agency issued a statement noting that the vast majority of assassination-related records have been released, and that redactions were intended “to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security — including the names of C.I.A. assets and current and former C.I.A. officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today.”

The release of the documents owes as much to the moviemaker Oliver Stone as anyone else. After his 1991 conspiracy theory movie “J.F.K.” stoked renewed interest, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which was signed into law by President George Bush on Oct. 26, 1992. The act mandated that all assassination records be released no later than 25 years from that date, which was Thursday, unless the president authorized further withholding for national security reasons.

In the years since the law was passed, the National Archives and Records Administration has released 88 percent of those documents in full and an additional 11 percent with portions redacted. Until Thursday, just 1 percent had been withheld in full.

Of the 2,891 documents released Thursday, only 53 had never been disclosed by the archives; the rest had been made public with redactions.

The papers range widely, and while many are not directly related to the assassination, others add context. One recounted the reaction of the Soviet Union to the killing, reporting that some in Moscow assumed it was a “coup” by the “ultraright” that would be blamed on the Soviet Union. An unnamed informant told American spies that the K.G.B. had proof that “President Johnson was responsible for the assassination.”

An F.B.I. cable from April 1964 reconstructed Oswald’s bus trip to Mexico weeks before the assassination, including the names of the people sitting around him and even what he was wearing: “a short-sleeved light colored sport shirt and no coat.”

In Hoover’s memo two days after the assassination, he expressed anxiety that Oswald’s killing would generate doubts among Americans. “The thing I am concerned about,” he wrote, “is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.” The F.B.I. director also fretted that discoveries that Oswald contacted the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington could “complicate our foreign relations.”

He called the Oswald killing “inexcusable” in light of “our warnings to the Dallas Police Department” and hinted at Ruby’s mob connections, which would soon spawn an industry of research and speculation. “We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago,” Hoover wrote.

The documents will not end the debate or speculation — and a few may add to the questions. In a 1975 deposition, for example, Richard Helms, the former C.I.A. director, was asked: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an agen…”

But the document ends there, and Mr. Helms’s answer is missing.","J.F.K. Files, Though Incomplete, Are a Treasure Trove for Answer Seekers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-jfk-release.html

Karnas is a professor of literature at Memorial University in Newfoundland. He had canceled a few classes to spend the week fishing with Banton, a member of the Canadian Coast Guard. As was the case downriver, the fish were showing but not biting. The duo did not seem disheartened. Banton, who has a tattoo of a salmon fly on his left forearm, intensely watched his line swing through the pool.

“We’ll keep at ’er,” he said.

In the middle section of the river, at Etheridge Pool, I watched Anita Coady make a series of graceful casts. Coady’s family has lived in the Margaree Valley for centuries. Though she travels a bit in other seasons, Coady is always sure to be home in the fall. “This place doesn’t ever change,” she said. “Why would you ever want it to?”

At the hub of much of the activity is Alex Breckenridge, the owner of the Tying Scotsman, the only full-service fly shop in the area. Breckenridge, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, ties flies to match the colors of the fall — deep red marabou streamers and bright orange shrimp patterns. He moved here from Ayrshire, Scotland, in 2003 and opened his shop two years ago. “This river is so accommodating,” he said. “All you need is a license and a place to stay.”

Like many, though, Breckenridge worries about the future of Atlantic salmon. A witches’ brew of maladies — including overharvest, habitat degradation and climate change — has caused a precipitous 30-year decline in worldwide Atlantic salmon populations. The species is now listed as endangered in the United States and is extinct on some rivers in southern Nova Scotia.

The Margaree has not been immune to the troubles. But angling organizations, like the international Atlantic Salmon Federation and the local Margaree Salmon Association, have taken steps to try to mitigate the decline. Recent measures on the Margaree include attempts at habitat restoration and a mandated catch-and-release policy on the river.

The declines in the runs have made some wistful for years past. But Gaines and Child shun the nostalgia. “Every week up here, and every day on the river, grants you a new chance,” Child said.

That optimism is a necessary trait for Atlantic salmon anglers. Its adherents are practiced in the art of rejection. The enigmatic species has been called “the fish of 1,000 casts” for good reason. (Atlantic salmon do not feed when they enter freshwater; many believe they strike flies out of some instinct developed as a juvenile in rivers.) Some anglers endure long stretches without catching a fish — I’d gone a full two weeks on the Margaree over the summer without even a strike.

It’s certainly not a sport for everyone, especially those with a steady iPhone habit. For others, though, the patient, repetitive process — and the ability to simultaneously daydream and pay close attention to your fly — is the entire point. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia and an avid Atlantic salmon fisherman, has likened salmon fishing to being stoned.

I’m firmly in Chouinard’s camp: The process is more important than the result. Still, on the last evening of my October trip, I was going on three weeks without a fish. What I wanted more than anything was to feel the pull of an Atlantic salmon — a jolt, always unexpected, like shaking hands with an overeager Texan.

I walked down to the lower river, tied on one of Breckenridge’s red-and-yellow marabou flies and began to cast. On my third swing, my fly suddenly stopped. The water frothed as the salmon leapt twice, completely clearing the surface of the river. Eventually, I tailed her and held her steady in the current, up to my elbows in the water. Her back was lightly bronzed, her flanks silvery. It was getting dark quickly and the air had chilled. My ritual of the fall was at its end. The salmon, with a flick of her strong tail, shot upstream, continuing on with hers.","When Salmon Return to the Margaree, It’s All Fly Rods and Autumn Glory",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/sports/fly-fishing.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said.","Ernesto Bazan was teaching a workshop in Brazil in 2013 when he received a call that his father, a surgeon and professor of medicine, had died in Sicily. He rushed home to Palermo, arriving just in time for the viewing, a powerful, if painful moment. Afterward, the body was cremated.

As dark smoke drifted from the funeral home’s chimney into the overcast sky, Mr. Bazan took what he called “the last portrait” of his father — making permanent a moment that underscored the fleeting nature of human existence.

That photograph became the cornerstone of his new book, “Before You Grow Up,” a family album he created for his twin 19-year-old sons, Stefano and Pietro, in which elegant photographs are mixed with drawings, letters, his mother’s journal entries, memorabilia and notebook pages.

“I made this book as a legacy for my sons, a visual testament that they can carry with them, and share with the people that they love,” he said, “and always love each other as my wife and I have been teaching them to do.”

The book echoes Mr. Bazan’s roles as a son; a husband to his wife, Sissy; and a father. Designed with Kevin Sweeney, it captures the joys and sorrows of 21st-century family life.

Mr. Bazan grew up in Palermo with the expectation that he would follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He started taking “average” pictures as a teenager, he recalled, and when he was 17 a voice came to him in a dream, whispering, “You’ve got to be a photographer.”

After two years arguing with his father over his career choice, he left for New York City to study photography and soon after began working internationally. He first traveled to Cuba in 1992 and was struck by the generosity of Cubans.

“I felt a very powerful connection with them,” he said. “Like I belonged to that place in another life.”

On a return trip three years later, Mr. Bazan and his friend and printer Mike Levin stumbled upon a scene that seemed out of a 1940s Italian movie, he recalled, as he watched “three beautiful young girls dancing in the streets of Havana.” Mr. Bazan started dancing with a 70-year-old woman while his friend chatted up other, younger, women. When the music ended, Mr. Bazan locked eyes with one of them, Sissy.

They married three years later. Shortly after, they had twins.

Mr. Bazan worked as an accredited photographer in Havana for an Italian sports newspaper and documented his new home in images infused with the rhythms of Cuba. He reveled in family life and photographed his wife and sons incessantly. He started teaching photo workshops, where his students became part of his extended family, too.

But nothing is ever straightforward in Cuba. When the authorities suspected that the workshops were really journalism classes in disguise, he was forced to stop. The decision was more than he could bear, so he relocated to Veracruz, Mexico, in 2006.

“I had to flee Cuba to continue teaching my workshop and to continue to be who I am,” he said.

But his sojourn was fruitful: He has published three books of his Cuban photographs — “Bazan: Cuba,” “Al Campo” and “Isla” — and moved to New Jersey in order to fulfill his sons’ desire to finish high school in the United States.

Photo

For seven years he struggled to make a book that would be his legacy to his sons, whom he had “photographed from the womb,” he said. It was, at times, a difficult and even painful process.

“This book has brought many tears in my eyes in the making,” Mr. Bazan, 58, said. “It’s a family album that also deals with sickness, sadness, mourning and death, but with an uplifting and positive look at the future, particularly the one of my children, who are beginning their new soulful journey into their adult part of life.”

Ultimately, “Before You Grow Up” is about the importance of family and the fragility of life — what a man leaves behind for his children, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren he might never meet.

“I hope my sons remember me as a decent father that was there for them at all times,” he said, “like my father and mother have been for me.”

Will and the Demogorgon

The center of the “Stranger Things” universe is the Byers family: the geeky 12-year-old Will (Noah Schnapp), who disappears on his way home from a Dungeons & Dragons game; his older brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), a teenage outcast who loves punk music; and their fragile but fiercely devoted single mom, Joyce (Winona Ryder).

As we find out, Will was spirited away to a creepy parallel dimension known as the Upside Down, by a monster whose head resembles a Venus fly trap. Will’s friends start calling the creature Demogorgon, after a demon from Dungeons and Dragons.

In the Season 1 finale, Jonathan; his friend Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer); and her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery), booby-trap the Byers house and lure the Demogorgon there in hopes of killing it. The teens put up a valiant fight, but as soon as they manage to set the monster on fire, it escapes. Thankfully, they’ve distracted it just long enough to allow Joyce to sneak into the Upside Down in hopes of saving Will.

In the final scene of the season, Will, Joyce and Jonathan celebrate Christmas together at home. It’s a happy ending — until Will starts to feel sick, coughs up a sluglike creature in the bathroom and is transported, for a moment, back to the Upside Down. You can take the kid out of the nightmare realm, but it seems that you can’t quite take the nightmare realm out of the kid.

A scene from “Stranger Things.” Netflix

The Lab and the Upside Down

Although the show spends plenty of time in the Upside Down, it’s still not entirely clear what this parallel reality actually is. We do know that a portal opened between the two realms when scientists at the Hawkins National Laboratory, a secretive government facility, used a telekinetic girl called simply “11” (Millie Bobby Brown) to make contact with the monster.

The Upside Down looks the way Hawkins might if its buildings and trees were all decaying, the sun never shined and everything were covered in vines made out of mucous. The air is supposedly toxic. (Uproxx has a great list of questions about the Upside Down that “Stranger Things” hasn’t answered yet.)

In the real Hawkins, the lab’s staff is desperate to find Eleven, who was the prisoner of its leader, Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), a research scientist who abducted the girl and raised her to consider him her father. As Brenner hunts for her, Will’s friends and family uncover the connection between the laboratory and the boy’s disappearance. A final showdown between the kids, the Demogorgon and Brenner’s minions leaves many of those minions dead. Going into Season 2, it’s not clear whether the scientist lived through the battle.

Eleven

Eleven isn’t just any psychokinetic tween. The show implies that she’s also the missing daughter of Terry Ives (Aimee Mullins), a local woman who accidentally got pregnant while participating in one of Brenner’s deeply unethical experiments. She is certain that her daughter, Jane, who was born with telekinesis and ESP, was abducted as a baby. But the lab’s cover-up has led her relatives to believe that Terry, who’s been catatonic for years, miscarried in her third trimester and became delusional after suffering that loss.

Because she’s spent her entire life in the lab undergoing Brenner’s experiments, Eleven is silent, scared and largely ignorant about the outside world by the time she meets Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). It’s with those three boys that she learns about the small pleasures of middle-school life, from frozen waffles to role-playing games.

Eleven’s story appears to end in the season finale’s climactic middle-school showdown, when she uses her powers to vanquish the Demogorgon and save her new buddies. Both she and the monster disappear. It’s a heartbreaking sacrifice, but it’s pretty clear she’ll be back for Season 2.

The Boys

While searching for Will, his friends meet an escaped Eleven and hide her in Mike’s basement. In hopes of making contact with Will, Dustin builds a sensory deprivation tank in the middle-school gym in order to recreate the setting where Eleven first glimpsed the Upside Down. And Lucas, who’s initially more suspicious of Eleven than the other boys are, goes on a solo spy mission at the laboratory. His reconnaissance helps her evade the feds — for a while.

Love, Hawkins Style

Just before Eleven battles the Demogorgon, Mike musters the courage to ask her to the school’s Snow Ball, and they kiss. His infatuation with her was palpable for most of the season, so their separation soon after is painful to see.

Theirs isn’t the only relationship thrown into chaos by the Upside Down. After Nancy’s best friend, Barb Holland (Shannon Purser), vanishes in much the same way Will did, Nancy and Jonathan investigate the disappearances together. Steve believes they’re hooking up behind his back and paints graffiti all over Hawkins, calling her a slut. But Steve redeems himself when he tells off his nasty friends and joins Nancy and Jonathan in battling the Demogorgon. Sadly for Jonathan, who’s obviously in love with her, Nancy and Steve are back together by the end of the season.

David Harbour in “Stranger Things.” Curtis Baker/Netflix

Chief Jim Hopper

And then there’s the most obvious love interest for Joyce: the local police chief, Jim Hopper (David Harbour). Initially a cynical, private and somewhat debauched presence in Hawkins, he becomes her greatest adult ally in the search for Will, and the two of them wind up trudging through the Upside Down together to find him. Still, years after his young daughter’s death and the divorce it catalyzed, Hopper remains a haunted man. As he struggles to resuscitate Joyce’s son, he flashes back to his little girl’s final days in the hospital, as doctors tried and failed to do the same. With Will, however, the efforts to revive him are successful, and Hopper and Joyce soon carry the boy to safety.

For all his heroism, we’re stuck with the uncomfortable fact that he gave up Eleven’s location to Brenner — and that his relationship with the feds may not have ended there. In a subsequent, unexplained scene, Hopper reluctantly gets into a car with people who appear to be government agents. Along with Will’s momentary descent into the Upside Down and Eleven’s whereabouts, this meeting is one of the finale’s most captivating cliffhangers.

What About Barb?

There’s one final loose end, and it’s #JusticeForBarb. Barb was last seen in the Upside Down, looking very still and white and lifeless, with a slug crawling out of her mouth. The show’s creators, Ross and Matt Duffer, have confirmed her death. But in an interview, Matt promised that while the internet’s favorite character won’t return, her story isn’t entirely over. “We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb,” he said.

New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington already have vibrant urban centers, not that they couldn’t be improved.
New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots.
(These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)
In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak’s northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.","This means far more than an attractive building or campus. Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle. Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macy’s department store downtown — a move rich in irony, given how Macy’s has struggled in competing with online retailers — and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the city’s downtown area.

The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon. The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle don’t use motorized transport to get to work. Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation. Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work.

Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office. The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.) It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers.

In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada.

The Alliance for Biking and Walking has ranked American cities based on the percentage of people who walk or ride bikes to work. In order, they are Boston, Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Ore., New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Chicago and Baltimore.

Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the company’s DNA.

New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington already have vibrant urban centers, not that they couldn’t be improved. They are also the kinds of places where local opposition to Amazon’s potential arrival would be more likely, based on factors like the impact on their already congested streets and criticism of the company’s workplace practices.

Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message.

“Amazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region,” he said. “That’s easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco. It’s much different than just tapping the talent that’s already there. Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that.”

Next on Amazon’s wish list are capital and operating costs” and “incentives,” which Amazon identifies as “high priority” considerations. That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “Amazon’s first obligation is to its investors,” Professor Elson said, which means finding “the most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters,” one that “will produce the most value for the company.”

Most contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark. Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so.

The accounting and consulting firm KPMG ranks major cities by costs in its biennial “Competitive Alternatives” survey. A score of 100 is equal to the United States baseline, so costs in a city with a score of 105 are 5 percent higher than the baseline; cities with a score of 95 are 5 percent lower.

New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots. (Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.) Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut. Washington’s score is 99.4.

The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austin’s score is 96.2. But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline. Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreal’s score is 85.2; Toronto’s is 85.6. Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies.

“Labor Force” is third on Amazon’s list. The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattle’s talent pool.

The commercial real estate firm CBRE produces an annual ranking of cities based on what it calls “tech talent,” which considers factors like technology positions as a percentage of all jobs, growth in tech jobs and tech-degree completion.

The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York — no surprises there. But other cities also fare well: Washington is No. 4, Toronto is No. 6, Boston is No. 9 and Baltimore is No. 11.

Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders.

Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive. Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants. Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there. Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact.

Amazon adds that “a strong university system is required.”

Many contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology. Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University.

Amazon cites logistics as “critically important,” specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco. (These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)

Virtually every major American airport could use an upgrade, but most big cities have international airports with many direct flights to the cities where Amazon does business. Pittsburgh lacks nonstop flights to Seattle and offers only limited nonstop service to international destinations. But the city was once a major hub for US Air, which made substantial investments in infrastructure there before it was taken over by American Airlines. The number of flights to and from Pittsburgh has dwindled since then, but they could easily be revived.

In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak’s northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.

“Community cultural fit” and “community quality of life” are last on Amazon’s list of preferences. Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions “a diverse population” and, again, “excellent institutions of higher education.” If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit.

Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives.

That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force. Given Amazon’s vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina’s widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights.

There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston.",Following the (Bike) Trail to Amazon’s Second Headquarters,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/business/amazon-headquarters-competition.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Butterfly,” our not-so-bright Gallimard — a French embassy official stationed in Beijing in the 1960s — falls head over heels for Song, who he thinks is a woman but is really a fetching young dude in Suzie Wong drag. That Gallimard (and his real-life prototype, Bernard Boursicot, whose case became an international scandal in the mid-1980s) failed to register the imposture has been the subject of much bewildered speculation and many jokes. (Check out the priceless “Forbidden Broadway” parody of the show.)

In the latest incarnation of the tale, Song is not merely a man pretending to be a woman. He’s a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be man who is pretending to be a woman. Got that? Never mind. We’ll get back to it later.

This extra turn of the screw of pretense is also directly from the case history of Monsieur Boursicot (the subject of a fascinating book by The New York Times columnist Joyce Wadler). But for audiences who must digest an already complex story (did I mention that Song is a spy for the Chinese government?) within less than three hours of stage time, it’s a lot to assimilate.

There is another, even more distracting problem. Once we’ve seen Mr. Ha — who has a distinctly masculine cast of a jaw — in boy’s clothes early on (that’s when he says he’s a man who works in drag as an actor in a Beijing opera house), it’s impossible to unsee him as that boy. Which makes Gallimard, our deluded protagonist, appear even more mentally challenged than usual.

You could argue that such obtuseness is appropriate for a play that considers the blindness not only of love, but also of cultural and sexual imperialism. Yes, Gallimard, who has never had much luck with women before, is responding to the novelty of a beautiful actress improbably finding him attractive.

But more important to the play’s intriguing and ever timely central thesis is the fact that Song is Asian, perceived as a fragile lotus blossom waiting to be plucked by virile white hands, like the doomed heroine of Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly,” Gallimard’s favorite opera. Such, it seems, is the West’s vision of the East.

Mr. Hwang more than implicitly compares Gallimard’s dim vision regarding his love object to the unrealistic beliefs that Western countries hold about the East. That includes the presumption that Vietnam would fall in a swoon before the manly forces of the United States. Song, whose mission as a spy is to elicit information from Gallimard about France’s involvement in Vietnam, speaks scornfully of a Western self-image involving “big guns, big industry, big … well, you know your own fantasies.”

But for “M. Butterfly” to have emotional impact, it must make its audiences uneasily complicit in that fantasy. In this version, you always maintain the distance — sometimes amused, sometimes appalled — that’s generated by your awareness of theatrical machinery churning away.

Don’t blame Mr. Owen, who works skillfully and, well, manfully at becoming a wimp in a part memorably originated by John Lithgow (and played by Jeremy Irons in the 1993 film). Though he has established himself on screen as a thinking person’s hunk (“Children of Men,” “The Knick”), Mr. Owen is surprisingly convincing here as someone who could never get a date in high school.

The show’s broken master of ceremonies, whom we meet in a French prison cell many years after the events recounted here, Gallimard does his best to frame the story of his relationship with Song as a love story worthy of tragic opera. As Mr. Owen’s Gallimard struggles to make facts succumb to romantic fiction, his discomfort in his own skin glistens like flop sweat.

If only this production trusted more in its reliably unreliable narrator, and let us see a bit more through his bedazzled eyes. Instead, the show has a grinding Brechtian self-consciousness throughout, which calls harsh attention to its less than subtle ironies.

Mr. Ha’s arch Song seems to be all too demonstratively in on the cosmic joke being played on poor old Gallimard. Building up the role of Song’s shrill Communist party liaison (Celeste Den) was a mistake. Though Enid Graham is fine in the thankless part of Gallimard’s wife, the character of his macho best friend (Murray Bartlett) remains an annoying device.

Most disappointing for Ms. Taymor’s fans is the production’s lack of the ravishing visuals she brought to “The Lion King” and her more recent “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” The tall, painted Chinese screens that frame each scene are alarmingly clunky and unsteady. (Paul Steinberg did the sets.)

The two centerpiece dance sequences, choreographed by Ma Cong, feel scrappy, like numbers from a pared-down touring production of “Miss Saigon.” And Elliot Goldenthal’s “original music and soundscapes” are usually more intrusive than evocative.

Such clumsiness sadly undermines a play that remains urgently relevant. Anyone doubting that Gallimard’s pipe dream of masculinity is still with us need only consult recent reports of the behavior of Hollywood moguls and American presidents or daily accounts of the United States military in quagmires on foreign soil.

But even if the romance at the heart of “M. Butterfly” is toxic, we still need to be swept up by the tide of this crazy infatuation. In this incarnation, we’re not being seduced, but preached at. And Gallimard’s grand self-sacrifice seems more pathetic and unnecessary than it ever did before.",Review: ‘M.

All the same, he’s now arguing that telling the truth about Trump is more important than enacting his most cherished political priorities. In doing so, he’s sacrificed a career he’s spent a lifetime building. He’s given more than most to the fight against Trump and Trumpism.

Indeed, as much as I hate Flake’s politics, I suspect there’s a connection between his intense political commitments and his bravery. Not long ago, I spoke to Eyal Press, the author of “Beautiful Souls: The Courage and Conscience of Ordinary People in Extraordinary Times,” a book about those who resist immoral authorities and institutions. We tend, Press told me, to “think of these people as iconoclasts, or imagine that they are somehow people with a kind of oppositional spirit,” but in fact, most of them are true believers in the purported ideals of their organizations. It’s because they value those ideals so highly, he said, that they’re moved to break ranks when they see them tarnished.

To recognize the role of Flake’s conservative principles in fueling his dissent is not to absolve the conservative movement for Trump. For decades, Republicans have stoked the culture war to win the support of people hurt by their economic policies. Under the guise of pushing back against left-wing bias, the right has systematically tried to discredit all objective sources of information, ushering in a berserk reactionary postmodernism in which truth loses its meaning. And though the Republican Party’s racial appeals used to be more coded, it’s been capitalizing on white resentment for a long time.

All the same, Trump is not just a vulgar version of a normal conservative. His authoritarianism threatens libertarian ideals as well as progressive ones, he’s personally repugnant in ways that transcend politics, and his incompetence endangers us all. There’s no contradiction between abhorring conservatism and being grateful to the conservatives who stand up to Trump.

Some who’ve criticized Flake have said that, rather than quitting, he should defend his principles in a primary fight. Maybe, but even the strongest-minded people can’t avoid tailoring their words and actions to suit the exigencies of political campaigns. The need to be re-elected can too easily become an excuse not to act.

Talking to a Republican Trump critic recently, I asked, as I often do, how his Republican friends in Congress live with themselves. He said some justify their silence by saying that if they speak out, they could be replaced by Trumpist lunatics. They’re not wrong, but they’re also offering up a common rationale for perpetual acquiescence. As Masha Gessen wrote right after the election, those who collaborate with authoritarianism often insist that they’re trying to ameliorate its excesses. There are always reasons not to speak up for what’s right.

Now that they’ve spoken, the next step for Flake, Corker, Senator John McCain and other Republicans who hope to be remembered kindly by history is to act. Corker, the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could hold hearings into how Trump has already eroded America’s position worldwide.

Both Corker and Flake should be willing to support legislation protecting the investigation of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Trump’s ties to Russia. They should also back legislation to curb the president’s ability to launch nuclear weapons unilaterally, and leave the door open to supporting impeachment.

In his speech, Flake promised to use his remaining 14 months in office standing up and speaking out “as if our country depends on it.” If he fails to do that, he’ll deserve progressive dismissals. But while a stirring anti-Trump speech is not enough, it’s a start.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — There are two kinds of people: Those who like their crosswords knotty and difficult, and those who pray for mercy just so they can make some headway. Eventually, and with enough practice, the mercy-seekers become the challenge-seekers. And then they claim that they have given up on doing the early week puzzles, because those are way too easy.

It’s a fair point. For some solvers, the Monday and Tuesday puzzles don’t present much of a challenge, but those puzzles are not really for them. They are for the people still getting the hang of solving, and for the ones who can appreciate a good, straightforward theme. They are for those who like to start their week on a positive note, with a win.

So the solvers who crave more of a challenge wait all week for the Friday and Saturday puzzles — they might even indulge themselves in a Thursday, with its gimmicky themes — and claim to be disappointed if the Friday is “too easy” for them. Don’t say “No, I would never do that”: I’ve seen you on Twitter.

I have news for those solvers: Today’s puzzle is not that hard, which, of course, is a totally subjective call. I didn’t find it hard.

Wellness retreats have served as a springboard to more emotionally charged events such as Renew, a breakup boot camp coming Dec. 1-3 to an estate in Saugerties, N.Y.

She adds that she has seen demand for women-only travel spike, particularly to places like India and Morocco where interests in wellness, culture and food are addressed.

Cultural offerings bring together women with similar interests. Katharine Landale, a marketing executive in London, couldn’t interest her husband or children in a trip to Moscow, but she found 10 like-minded friends keen on Catherine the Great and caviar to go with Red Savannah on a new female-guided tour.

A GUIDE TO WOMEN’S GUIDES

Judi Wineland, a veteran of the adventure travel industry, acquired AdventureWomen, one of the oldest women-only specialists, last year and brought in her 28- and 30-year-old daughters to help run the company. New trips include viewing the northern lights in Finland and seeing orangutans in Indonesia and offer women-to-women exchanges with locals, from female politicians to divers for pearl oysters in Japan.

“We’re a relationship company and our medium is travel and our travel is to less-visited places off the beaten path,” Ms. Wineland said.

Among new women-focused companies, Living Big offers small group trips to places like Iceland and Kauai where the focus is on adventure (the eight-day trip to the Hawaiian island of Kauai in May costs $3,649). But it also guides trips to Italy and New Orleans where the emphasis might shift to food or music, and customizes trips for solo travelers and small groups.

Allison Fleece and Danielle Thornton co-founded WHOA Travel, which stands for Women High on Adventure, in 2013 in a moment of inspiration after their own exhilarating climb up Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. WHOA now runs trips around the world, but its Kilimanjaro trips remain popular (from $3,400 for nine days).

“It’s safer and there’s built-in camaraderie when you’re sharing experiences,” Ms. Thornton said.

Long-established, but new to the gender-specific tour, Austin Adventures will offer three new women-only itineraries. The tours are led by Kasey Austin Morrissey, the 28-year-old daughter of the company’s owner, Dan Austin; she has worked in the family business since she was 11, and is now the company’s vice president of operations. She considers adventure trips the new spa getaways, places where women “are looking to challenge themselves and their friends by pushing their limits together.”

Trips include nine days in Costa Rica in March (from $3,498) and from six days in Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks in May (from $2,798).

Responding to a rise in women traveling on its regular itineraries last year — 65 percent versus 55 percent the year prior — and the requests of its clients, Exodus Travels just announced 12 departures dedicated to and guided by women. They range from 15 days touring Iran (from $3,715) to eight days walking in Italy ($1,705) and five days climbing Mount Toubkal in Morocco (from $545).

Other companies are similarly increasing their women’s trips. REI Adventures, the travel arm of the outdoor goods retailer, saw its female participation jump 60 percent in the last seven years. In 2015, it debuted women’s trips and added 19 new itineraries to the Women’s Adventures series this year, including an 11-day trip to South Africa that combines a wildlife safari with sea kayaking, hiking and cycling (from $7,699). A 10-day trip to New Zealand hits the hiking trails of the Southern Alps (from $5,199) and a nine-day trip to Greece spans yoga sessions, vineyard hikes and cooking classes.

Seventy percent of trips run by Wild Women Expeditions, established in 1991, features backcountry camping. New 2018 departures include a trip that emphasizes hiking and other activities in Torres del Paine National Park in Chilean Patagonia (10 days from $5,295) and a multisport tour of Costa Rica (eight days from $3,295).",For Women Only: Tours That Emphasize Adventure,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/travel/tours-for-women.html

Three years later, he drove that 1960 Corvette convertible to the photographer Frank Stefanko’s home in Haddonfield, N.J., for photo sessions that he hoped would produce cover art for his much anticipated follow-up album, 1978’s “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” The result was the opposite of the kind of glossy, self-celebratory portraits that had graced the album covers of freshly-minted rock stars since Elvis moved to Graceland and parked a new Cadillac out front.

The chosen cover photo — done not in a studio, but in a window alcove of Mr. Stefanko’s modest home — portrayed Mr. Springsteen as neither air-nor-hair brushed. He wore a white V-neck undershirt and looked more like one of the hard-luck road warriors that populate his songs than the rock and roll savior hailed on magazine covers.

“Frank’s photographs were stark,” Mr. Springsteen wrote in his 2016 memoir, “Born to Run,” whose cover featured a haggard portrait of the author posed with his ’Vette in Haddonfield in 1978. “[H]e managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice, and get to the raw you. … His pictures captured the people I was writing about in my songs and showed me the part of me that was still one of them.”

Photo

The weekslong “Darkness” photo sessions were the first in 40-plus years of collaborations between Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Stefanko, who has collected his portraits and outtakes in “Bruce Springsteen, Further Up the Road,” a pricey ($380-$630) limited edition book to be published by Wall of Sound Editions in November.

Mr. Stefanko — who was introduced to Mr. Springsteen through a mutual friend, the punk poet and rocker Patti Smith — also did the cover image for the Boss’s 1980 double album, “The River,” as well as other projects over the years.

But it is the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, shot in and around Haddonfield when Mr. Springsteen turned 29, that strikingly capture the same kind of behind-the-rock-star persona that the now 68-year-old rocker presented in his autobiography and that he draws from in his one-man “Springsteen on Broadway” shows at the Walter Kerr Theater. In the solo show, noted the New York Times reviewer Jesse Green, he “comes off as the kind of character he often writes about: a pink-slipped worker in a shuttered factory in a dying industry.”

As Eric Meola, who shot the famous “Born to Run” album cover photo, writes in an introduction to Mr. Stefanko’s book, “In some of the outtakes from the “Darkness” sessions, Bruce simply stares at the camera with the dazed look of someone who has just shaken off blows from an unseen adversary.”

In one such black and white tramps-like-me portrait, Mr. Stefanko shot Mr. Springsteen — dressed in jeans, motorcycle boots, a checked shirt and leather jacket — as he sat on the two-step brick porch of a home not a lot different from the one where he grew up on the poorer side of Freehold, N.J. Not to mention looking like he didn’t know what — a night on the town or rock superstardom — hit him.

Other photos, including the book’s cover, find him in the same checked shirt, hulking down a grim brick alleyway and crammed into a booth with his E Street Band mates, looking like a street gang of off-duty drag racers, at Shellow’s, an ice cream shop in nearby East Camden, N.J.

Photo

Despite the downbeat mood of most of the photos, Mr. Springsteen was in good spirits throughout the Darkness sessions, Mr. Stefanko said in a 2010 interview with the music website Pitchfork. “Especially when the E Street Band was in the house,” he said. “Bruce kept everyone from getting bored by telling these wild stories. And I learned that Clarence Clemons was a great chess player. Some of the guys even set up a craps table on my dining room table between shots, just to pass the time.”

Mr. Stefanko said some of his color photos were done in an attempt to recreate the feel of “an old Kodacolor snapshot” that might have been found while rummaging “in somebody’s drawer.”

Consider this simple image (Slide 3): Mr. Springsteen sits on the bed of an otherwise nondescript motel room cradling an acoustic guitar. Mounted on the wall is an amateur but eye-catching painting of a woman in a white wedding gown with pink sash, floating like an angel in the sky.

The painting is similar to an image that hung in Mr. Springsteen’s boyhood home and that, he wrote in his autobiography, haunted him all his life. It was a photo of a girl in a white dress, his father’s sister, killed by a truck at age 5 while riding her tricycle. The death changed his family’s dynamic, causing long-lasting rifts that ultimately led him to get out while he was young — and to that motel room with the means of his escape in hand. And a reminder on the wall of a dead aunt whose “seemingly benign gaze” warned, he wrote, “‘Watch out!’”

Mr. Stefanko’s book is itself a kind of drawer full of forgotten snapshots, some offering clues to what it was that made their subject know that like his characters, he too was born to run.



The photographs will be on view in an exhibit at Morrison Hotel Gallery, New York, from Nov. 9, 2017.

The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.

Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.

Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the Penn bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.

There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of Penn’s black freshmen and in turn, Penn’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.

The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on Penn’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.

That problem is not exclusive to the University of Pennsylvania: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.

Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.

Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the Penn administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.

Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.

The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at Penn. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The Penn S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)

Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the University of Oklahoma who had been accepted to Penn but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Oklahoma issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no Penn students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.

GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.

An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.

The creator of the GroupMe and the people who hung the fliers hid their names and faces, putting the students they were targeting in the precarious position of questioning who to trust.

Who is to blame for a faceless flier or for anonymous internet trolling? Either incident could be indicative of the racist opinions of one person or of many.

Morris Pearl in Democracy Journal:



“While the Trump tax plan is a long, complex series of changes to the tax code, the elimination of the federal estate tax ranks high among the most egregious ideas.”

Mr. Pearl is the chairman of the Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of wealthy individuals worried about economic inequality. He defends the estate tax, which the Trump administration is seeking to revoke in its plan. “Were every child to be able to succeed in this country regardless of their family circumstances, perhaps concern over concentrating wealth would be unfounded,” he writes. “That is unfortunately not the case.” Read more »

Justin Miller in American Prospect:

“Quietly, Republicans are also pushing a territorial taxation provision that would make it far easier for multinational corporations to avoid paying even a new 20 percent rate by providing further incentive to stash profits in offshore tax havens.”

Mr. Miller argues that a provision in the Republican tax plan will encourage corporations to shift their profits to overseas tax havens. Republicans want to move to a territorial system that mirrors how much of the world structures its corporate taxes — a system that does not tax foreign profits at all. However, Mr. Miller says he is unconvinced that Republicans will install adequate protections against corporations storing their profits in offshore tax shelters. If they were serious about this, he writes, they would “simply end the deferral of corporations’ foreign profits and tax them annually like domestic profit.” Read more »

Helaine Olen in The Washington Post:

“It’s already hard enough to make the American system of saving for retirement more difficult, confusing or disadvantageous for lower- and middle-income savers. But Republicans just might be on the verge of accomplishing this — all in an effort to game the budget process.”

Even though President Trump said on Twitter that there would be no changes to 401(k) plans, Ms. Olen explains, the issue is not as resolved as he would have you believe. On Wednesday, there were reports that the retirement savings plans were still up for negotiation. Ms. Olen argues that the problem is not just Mr. Trump’s shifting positions on the retirement accounts, but, more broadly, how willing Republicans are to toy with retirement plans “all in an effort to game the budget process.” Read more »

Finally, From the Center

Veronique de Rugy in Reason:



“The good news is that there’s a debate in Washington about how to make the tax code less destructive. The bad news is that lawmakers will be able to achieve much less than they otherwise could because of bad policy priorities.”

Ms. de Rugy, writing for the libertarian Reason, accuses Republicans of being fiscally irresponsible with their tax plan. She says she worries that “failing to restrain spending today while cutting taxes means that taxes will have to go up in the future to pay for larger deficits.” She adds that while it may be politically expedient, giving the middle class a large tax cut is counterproductive: “There’s very little economic growth to be expected from reducing the marginal tax rates on middle-income earners.” Read more »

Justin Fox in Bloomberg:

“I figure this is as good a time as any to run through what’s wrong with the 401(k), or at least what’s wrong with having made it a centerpiece of our country’s retirement savings system.”

Mr. Fox explains why the 401(k) tax break should not be “untouchable,” even if it is politically popular. Millions of taxpayers benefit from the plan, he writes, but far more get nothing from it. “If the idea is to actually reduce the tax deductions for retirement savings, not just shift them across time,” he argues, “it’s maybe not so crazy.” Read more »

_____

Josh Barro in Business Insider:

“If you’re going to give a tax break for business income, you have to clearly define what’s a business and what’s just work. That’s surprisingly hard.”

Mr. Barro applauds the Republican goal of simplifying the tax code. However, he notes, one provision in the plan will complicate a lot of people’s taxes. The preferential tax rates for so-called pass-through businesses, which allow owners to be taxed on the income from their business, can be abused, or worse, put business owners at a disadvantage. The solution? “Don’t enact the tax preference in the first place.” Read more »

Tiger Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving on Friday and will be put on probation for a year and attend a rehabilitation program.

Woods, 41, made the plea in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.

Woods was found by a police officer asleep at the wheel of his parked Mercedes in May. Woods had “extremely slow and slurred speech,” a police report said. He was “sluggish, sleepy and unable to walk alone.”

Woods struggled with sobriety tests at the scene and was later found to have five drugs in his system, including Vicodin, Xanax and Ambien, but no alcohol.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Yes, hi, remember yesterday, when I said that you might as well solve the Friday because it wasn’t as hard as you would imagine it to be and besides, the Saturday puzzle would be much harder? Well, they don’t pay me the medium-sized bucks for nothing. Today’s puzzle by Samuel A. Donaldson and Brad Wilber is a real ... let’s just call it a learning experience, O.K.?

The bottom line on this very worthy puzzle: It’s tough, but it’s not tougher than you. Forget the horse-drawn carriage at 15A and the sainted archbishop of Canterbury at 19A for a second and drop in REID for TARA of the “Sharknado” films. There is no shame in knowing that. It will help you get the crossings. Maybe. If you know that Adobe makes the software that creates PDFs, put that in at 27A. Now you’ve got _ _ _ _ RP at 1D, which is a musical note. That’s got to be a SHARP note, right? Fill that in to help you get started on the northwest. You can come back for the first letter later. Now continue on like that until you get your toehold.

As tough as it is, it is also as close to a perfect Saturday crossword as they come. The grid is pristine, even if you are not familiar with some of the answers. The entries fluctuate between highly entertaining (HOSTESS TWINKIES) and hard to reach without help (IMARETS, which I feel like I should have known), but each of them are exquisite gems and they are all clued nearly perfectly. It just may take some reliance on outside references. The cluing is ramped up to 11, as evidenced, for one, by “Jet launcher” for GEYSER. That Kellogg brand at 40A is EGGO, of course.

Thriving as a single person doesn’t challenge conventions of gender or sexuality, but it does contest the notion that romantic partnerships must take precedence over other relationships.","At the campground, a young couple frightened me by virtue of being the only other people around. They had tethered their barking dog to a stake and hung a set of prayer flags from the open trunk of their S.U.V., but now they were packing up — silently at first, and then with hard, fighting words.

I shut my door and pretended I couldn’t hear.

They could see me as clearly as I saw them, though, and when I looked at myself through their eyes, I saw a person who couldn’t possibly be having a good time. My aloneness eclipsed everything else about me; I lacked even the company of a series of “thinking of you” texts to convince me otherwise.

I felt conspicuous, as odd and unsettling as a mermaid in the desert. I felt queer.

It was a feeling that had chased me all year, first at an orientation event for new faculty at the college where I had begun to teach. “Let’s get to know each other,” our leader had said. “Tell everyone about your hobbies and your partners.”

I joined in congratulating the business professor on his summer wedding even as I worried about what I would say. The request accommodated varying sexualities but left the possibility of singlehood unacknowledged.

“I’m single and I like long bike rides,” I finally declared, wondering if these strangers pitied me or if they saw my singlehood as the sign of something unpleasant and uncooperative. I had considered “happily single” but knew the emphasis would ring false — no reason to emphasize unless you had something to defend.

Later, when new friends in that town effused about having me over for dinner but failed to follow through, I felt queer again. I suspected they felt awkward inviting me when everyone else would arrive in twos. I was the only single person among 11 at a dinner I did attend.

When I heard of an acquaintance who, running for local office, worried that her singlehood made her untrustworthy in voters’ eyes, I could empathize. There was something queer about being single: queer in the sense of “strange,” yes, but also in the sense that connotes a threat to the conventions around which most people arrange their lives.

Before the call dropped with my newly separated friend, we had been talking about shame.

“I’m so old to be single and so young to be divorced,” she said. “What will people think?” Her husband had been abusive and she knew she would be better off, but she still feared that something was wrong with her for not making the relationship work.

The shame of having “failed” at marriage isn’t unlike the “failure” of being single, if you consider the congratulations offered newlyweds the sign of a universal goal achieved.

Mine was a shame I only recently had begun to inspect. How much of the feeling arose from my own desire to couple up, and how much from the sense that, by not doing so, I was confounding family and friends? How much came from the suspicion that, when colleagues asked whether my new apartment was spacious enough, they were actually wondering if I lived alone — but found the prospect too tragic to name?

Shame, after all, is pain with a twist: It shows us more about the communities we live in and the stories we tell than about ourselves. What my own shame revealed was a desire to conform. And when I viewed singlehood as akin to queerness, I felt grateful for the queer community’s reminder that convention shouldn’t dictate how relationships are defined. The opposite of shame, of course, is pride.

“When I was a young person coming out, it was like I signed up for this crazy, marginal life,” a lesbian in her 50s once told me. She is married now and rarely feels queer. Her sexuality hasn’t changed, but her life had mainstreamed.

The history and the present of queer people’s marginalization are far more severe, but the strides they have taken toward having their lives recognized are proportionally as vast. Meanwhile, queer or not, single people are treated with a mild exclusion and a bafflement that feels centuries past.

Maybe this is because, unlike the identity categories under the umbrella of queerness, singlehood can be elected or cast aside. As a result, and especially if you’re a childless white woman in her 30s, like me, singlehood is a state people assume you are trying to flee. For years, without reflection, I made the same assumption about myself.

How could I not, when even the Supreme Court would declare, with the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act, that to be unmarried was to be “condemned to live in loneliness”? The pathos typically associated with singlehood is that severe.

But if I wanted coupledom as badly as I have been led to believe I must, I’m pretty sure I would have dated more intensively and made bigger compromises. Strangers may refer to me as “still” single, as though I suffer from a persistent disease, but some part of me must love the life I lead.

To call the unmarried “lonely” is to pretend that marriage confers companionship, not merely a set of privileges historically reserved for long-term companions. But the longer I have been single, the more I have devoted myself to companionship in the form of close friendships that enrich my life. Thriving as a single person doesn’t challenge conventions of gender or sexuality, but it does contest the notion that romantic partnerships must take precedence over other relationships.

I have a long-married friend who used to question why I lived alone until we realized that to do so without questioning why she lived with a partner was unfair. Another friend reminds me that to reclaim singlehood the way queer people once reclaimed “queer” is a means of seizing power.

Even when doing so is an attempt to console yourself, as you sit frightened and alone, in an endless desert, under a sudden hailstorm, trapped in the bubble of your car.

Or later, when you have to relearn — as I would after the end of the relationship I was in then — that owning singlehood doesn’t just mean staring down others’ discomfort; it also means facing the fear and pity in yourself.

First step: Get out of the car.

It had stopped hailing. The couple had driven away. There was a steaming hot-spring pool to warm up in and a bathhouse whose two hot-spring showers ran continuously.

Inside, I discovered I could lock the door. The huge space was mine alone, but when I peeled off my bathing suit and searched for my reflection in the mirrored wall, I saw abandoned flip-flops, damp paperbacks and bottles of shampoo — the traces of other lives. Names and messages were carved into wet wood. Someone had painted a heart on the wall, or maybe just a big kidney bean.

It would be a lie to say I didn’t crave the heat of another body in that space. Contrary to what the Supreme Court might suggest, though, companionship doesn’t always mitigate loneliness. Loneliness dissipates when you find comfort and pleasure in your own company.

To that end, I suggest a long, soothing shower, in a gorgeous and mysterious place.",Is There Something Odd About Being Single?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/modern-love-is-there-something-odd-about-being-single.html

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.","Joao Silva came of age as a photographer documenting social upheaval in South Africa. Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

Economists doubt that the Nordic model can be transplanted from Scandinavia — where dealings between unions and employers are convivial — to France, where strikes that bring life to a halt are a cherished ritual.

Major unions see a plot to strip away labor protections with happy talk of government support that will never materialize. Many doubt that Mr. Macron can find the money to bolster the safety net.

“Flexicurity is just fancy packaging,” said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels. “So far, it’s all flexibility and no security.

“Mr. Macron is handing out tax cuts to the richest 10 percent,” she continued. “They will do the labor reforms, and then they will tell you that there is no money for anything else.”

That France needs change is a given. Its unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and has risen even as the picture has improved in countries worst hit by the European crisis like Spain, Italy and Portugal. Nearly one in four young people is unemployed.

But how to generate more jobs provokes fierce argument.

Unions pin blame for high unemployment on weak demand for goods and services. Pay workers more, they say, and spending will be unleashed through the French economy, generating jobs.

The unions are often caricatured as intransigent obstacles to progress, and they have a way of amplifying that image. Ask the CGT — a major union that has struck the most combative stance against the changes — for its plan to fix France. Its leaders call for cutting the workweek from the current 35 hours to a mere 32. Then, they say, more people will be needed.

To the government, this type of thinking — prime material for French lampooning — exemplifies how the country has failed to adapt. Renault, the French automaker, now manufactures cars in Romania, where wages are a fraction of those in France. Restricting work invites an exodus of jobs to lower-wage countries.

What France needs, Mr. Macron asserts, is flexibility that can free entrepreneurs from the strictures of an outmoded labor code. The changes are supposed to make it possible for start-up companies to pay lower wages in their early stages, rather than having to hew to national labor contracts that govern janitors, agricultural workers and people on assembly lines.

In contrast to years past, when labor militancy killed stabs at an overhaul, the government has this time won the cautious assent of some unions. Strikes in recent weeks have failed to inflict much disruption, underscoring a sense that the changes are essentially a done deal.

Still, the CGT vows to battle on, accusing the government of an appalling attack on the rights of laborers.

“Macron is suggesting a total societal change that goes against what has guided French society since the end of World War II,” said Manu Blanco, a board member of the CGT. “He is suggesting a model of extreme individualism, where workers earn hardly anything.”

Whatever the merits, Mr. Macron’s move does pose a historic challenge to power dynamics between working people and their bosses. Under a law adopted in 1884, unions were enshrined as the sole official representatives of French employees. They have maintained broad authority over national wages and working conditions ever since.

Over the last two decades, companies have extracted the right to hire temporary workers. The fresh changes allow smaller companies to negotiate directly with workers, while enabling larger companies to work out agreements with unions tailored to local conditions.

“The fundamental inspiration of these reforms is the idea that protection of workers has gone too far,” said Michel Pigenet, an expert in the history of labor movements at the Sorbonne in Paris. “That, in a globalized system, these protections are a constraint on competitiveness and the economy.”

The government and its advisers frequently cite Germany as an inspiration for their labor plan. After German employers gained greater latitude over wages in the 1990s, joblessness dropped significantly. German companies became more competitive.

But much of that boost came via a drop in pay. Poverty has risen in Germany along with the numbers of people depending on government aid. This has corresponded with an increase in part-time work.

“It’s not a model,” said Eric Beynel, a spokesman for Solidaires, a French union that opposes the labor changes. “It’s been a catastrophe.”

The new rules are directed at lowering the unemployment rate. But joblessness is at best an incomplete indicator of economic health.

In many major economies — strikingly, in the United States and Britain — the unemployment rate has fallen sharply, yet average wages are lower than a decade ago, after accounting for inflation. Many new jobs are low-paying, part-time positions.

French unions cite these realities as backing for their fight. In their vernacular, competitiveness and flexibility are just euphemisms for diminished livelihood and anxiety.

But only 8 percent of the French work force belongs to a union. The unions opposing the new rules are vulnerable to charges that they accept joblessness for the masses as the price of protecting their narrow segment of French workers — a group that trends white and male.

“Their clients are insiders, so they defend insiders,” said Agnès Bénassy-Quéré, an economist who chairs the Economic Analysis Council, which advises the French government on policy.

On a recent morning at the unemployment office in the 19th Arrondissement of Paris — an area home to many North African immigrants — people lining up for assistance tended not to see unions as a force in their lives.

“It’s hard to find jobs,” said Sara Omari, 36, a Tunisian immigrant. “It’s easier for French people.”

Economists doubt the central premise of the labor plan — that easing firing will inspire companies to hire. “In the short term, it will actually make it easier to destroy jobs,” said Eric Heyer, an economist at SciencesPo, a university in Paris. “A lot of businesses have too many people.”

The Nordic-style support system is posited as a cushion against joblessness while allowing workers to make a transition to more fruitful careers.

Given that France already has national health care, a minimum wage and generous social welfare programs, this is not fanciful. Mentioning the Nordic model to a labor economist tends to elicit the same reaction as references to Provençal cuisine for a gastronome.

But the Nordic model is as much a cultural phenomenon as a set of codified rules, a spirit of collective prosperity spanning labor and management.

“The level of confidence between the social partners is at a very high level,” said Oystein Dorum, chief economist at NHO, the main employers’ association representing Norwegian businesses in negotiations with unions. “There’s a sense from the other side of the table that wage claims must be reasonable so we can protect enterprises, and profitable enterprises lead to more jobs.”

The unpleasantries of budget arithmetic may pose the biggest challenge of all.

Mr. Macron has vowed to trim spending as he strives to comply with European limits on public debt. That imperative has special force as the French president woos German support for his proposals to further integrate the countries that share the euro currency. Winning Germany’s blessing requires that France demonstrate a commitment to European budget rules, which are revered in Berlin (except when Germany is breaking them).

Mr. Macron appears to have wrested the upper hand. Parliament will most likely ratify his changes before the end of the year. Then, the tougher challenge commences — proving that greater risk translates into greater security in a nation that has long revered equality.",Nordic-Style Designs Sit at Heart of French Labor Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/business/france-labor-reform-economy-macron.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Still, she says, “I think it is a very good idea for the sake of the brain to be moving and active.”","Last year, in an important study published in NeuroImage, the researchers found for the first time that young brain cells in adult mice that spent a month with running wheels in their cages did seem to be different from those in animals that did not run. For the experiment, the scientists injected a modified rabies vaccine into the animals, where it entered the nervous system and brain. They then tracked and labeled connections between brain cells and learned that compared to the sedentary animals’ brain cells, the runners’ newborn neurons had more and longer dendrites, the snaky tendrils that help to connect the cells into the neural communications network. They also found that more of these connections led to portions of the brain that are important for spatial memory, which is our internal map of where we have been and how we got there.

This type of memory is often diminished in the early stages of dementia.

But these findings, while intriguing, involved animals that had been running for a month, which is the equivalent of years of physical activity by people. The researchers wondered whether such changes in neurons and connections might actually begin earlier and maybe almost immediately after the animals began to exercise.

So for the new study, which was published last month in Scientific Reports, most of the same researchers gathered a group of adult, male mice. (Males were used to avoid accounting for the effects of the female reproductive cycle.) The animals were injected with a substance that marks newborn neurons. Half were then allowed to run for a week on wheels in their cages, while the others remained inactive. Afterward, some were also injected with the modified rabies vaccine to track new synapses and connections between the neurons.

When the scientists then microscopically examined brain tissue, they found that the runners’ brains, as expected, teemed with far more new neurons than did the brains of the sedentary animals, even though the runners had been exercising for only a week.

Interestingly, these neurons also looked unique. They were larger and, as in the study of mice that ran for a month, displayed more and longer dendrites than similar neurons in the other animals. In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.

These young cells were better integrated into the overall brain circuitry, too, with more connections into portions of the brain involved in spatial and other types of memory. Most surprising to the scientists, these cells also proved to be less easily activated by neurochemical messages to fire rapidly, which is usually a hallmark of more mature neurons. They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.

What these differences in cell structure and connection mean for brain function remains uncertain, though, says Henriette van Praag, a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health and senior author of this and the earlier study. Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.

But the current study “provides more pieces of evidence that brain cells produced under running conditions are not just quantitatively but qualitatively different” than other neurons, she says, “and these differences are evident very soon” after exercise begins.

Perhaps most important, the new brain cells in the runners tended to integrate into and bulk up portions of the brain that, if damaged by disease, are associated with early memory loss and dementia, she adds.

Of course, this experiment used mice, which are not people. While some past neurological studies with people have hinted that exercise might alter our brain structure in similar ways, she says, that possibility is still theoretical.

Trump, of course, has never apologized for giving comfort to people who marched on behalf of a confederacy of slaveholders. And we all know that race would be an issue if a black occupant of the White House had fathered five children with three women, attacked grieving combat widows and exploited the office for personal gain.

But when people shame fellow citizens with the blunt edge of identity politics, they only encourage the backlash that gave us Trump.

White people who are not privileged — the poor, the uneducated, the struggling — feel belittled when elite whites scorn their “privilege.” What’s privileged about living paycheck to paycheck? About eight million citizens voted for President Obama — twice — and then flipped their vote for Trump. Most of them, surely, are not racist.

What they heard from Obama was the best American music. “In no other country is my story even possible,” he said in his 2008 speech on race. After noting that he won some of the whitest counties in the country, he criticized a view “that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above what we know is right with America.”

To dismiss white concern over busing or affirmative action as racist “only widens the racial divide and increases misunderstanding,” he said. Yet, that is exactly what many liberal whites and blacks are doing now. Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his new book of essays, compares gentrification, which comes in many colors, to “a more pleasing name for white supremacy.”

He’s been getting pushback from African-Americans with a more expansive view. “Coates has convinced me that his particular brand of anti-racism does more political harm than good,” wrote Cedric Johnson, a professor of African-American studies at University of Illinois at Chicago, in an essay last year.

Certainly Steven Bannon knows that. He has repeatedly said that the more Democrats talk about identity and race, the more it helps his white nationalistic cause.

If all cultural appropriation is bad — extending even to, say, an Italian-American chef becoming expert in North African food — then we are doomed. If everyone is a racist, then no one can be saved from an awful destiny at birth.

Most Americans now feel their own group faces discrimination, according to a new NPR poll. A majority of whites say that discrimination exists against whites, even though a majority have not personally experienced it.

Mr. Weinstein’s social diagnosis successfully invoked the era that we had just memorialized after Hugh Hefner died. Mr. Hefner invented the Playboy ethos that Mr. Weinstein used like a get-out-of-jail-free card. “The culture then” encouraged men to loosen their libidos and women were expected to tolerate it. Playboy operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way — his. And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.

When Oliver Stone and Woody Allen came forward to express sympathy for Mr. Weinstein, everybody rolled their eyes at them, too. More defensive insult, and from men seemingly indifferent to an internet that swiftly dredged up trouble from their own sexual histories. That both directors felt a need to speak up illustrates an enduring, but misguided, myth of the sexual revolution. We romanticized Mr. Hefner’s empire as a revolutionary force — lovers gonna love, and all of that — but it was actually just a popularization of entitlement.

Photo

In the wake of the Weinstein news, as more women detail unwanted encounters with colleagues and bosses, we’re seeing how common it was for men, indeed, to help themselves. We’re seeing how the personal Playboy fantasy, benign as it might have looked, could spread into the workplace.

Mr. Hefner’s disdain for sexual limits fueled fantasies and shaped self-images. He was the Walt Disney of lust — and had his own set of seemingly innocuous iconic animal ears. You didn’t have to read Playboy, visit the mansion, wear pajamas or even be straight: The effects of its ideas about women on the American psyche were totalizing. Women were inferior to men because, for Playboy, they were scenery — pretty, passive, usually white, often blonde, there.

The Playboy doctrine would mutate into the darker, more explicit realm that is spooling out on “The Deuce.” Pornography gave us a framework for understanding sex as both an act and a state of mind that was similar to Hollywood’s imposition of ideas about romance.

The stories that get repeated in plot after plot have become a kind of erogenous pop-culture value system: women as prey, as parts (boobs, bottoms, lips, legs) as often as wholes; leading women but also the “final girl.” A search for full female humanity in Hollywood movies turns up a lot of dolls and dream girls.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The culture now seems eager to challenge some of those values — or at least to restage, unpack and reckon with, in Mr. Weinstein’s words, “the culture then.” The journalistic depiction of prostitution and a burgeoning porn cinema on “The Deuce” is grim and queasy and morally suspenseful. Not even the wiliest, most enterprising female characters fare well. But the show’s most exhilarating moments are on the faces of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dominique Fishback, as they come alive with plans of self-determination, of power-sharing. But it feels like it might take forever for their dreams to come true.

The other night I saw “Battle of the Sexes,” which recounts that time in 1974 when the former tennis champ and self-styled chauvinist clown Bobby Riggs baited Billie Jean King into playing a match that became a national political spectacle. It’s not a great movie. Things get logy anytime it goes near a hotel room. (Why don’t moviemakers know that hotel air isn’t quite the same as oxygen?)

But I went home happy, anyway. That’s because the movie takes a rollicking, triumphal approach to the feminism of its day. (It was also known as “women’s lib” back then.) The men sit around in locker rooms and lounges grinning and grunting and slurping beer. Howard Cosell says about Ms. King, “Should she ever let her hair grow down to her shoulders, took her glasses off, you’d have somebody vying for a Hollywood screen test.”

Photo

It’s true that no one is bragging about how easy it is to grab a woman by her vagina. And Riggs, courtesy of Steve Carell, is a cartoon: loud, bawdy, shameless, mildly pathetic, opportunistically insincere, a little desperate, a jester in misogynist drag. He’s like the villain in an episode of “Scooby Doo” before Scooby and the gang yank off his mask. I would’ve gotten away with it, if it weren’t for you meddling feminists!

And yet the old Riggs’s chauvinism is still out there. Earlier this month, Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers’ quarterback was asked by a sports reporter, Jourdan Rodrigue, a standard professional question about his receivers and their routes. He didn’t notice her professionalism. He noticed something else: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes.” (The lassitude in his response acquires some lasciviousness for that last word.)

This is to say that the Playboy-era myths are hard to shake. “Battle of the Sexes” and “The Deuce,” especially, show how resistant we are to real equality. One dead pimp on “The Deuce” doesn’t end male-controlled prostitution. Systemic inequity is harder to kill. So is the misogyny that fuels it.

The disentanglement of Harvey Weinstein from Hollywood’s institutions has, so far, culminated in the termination of his membership in the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit whose duties include handing out the Oscars. His eviction might address an aspect of the Harvey Weinstein problem. But it doesn’t do much to reverse the absence of women from all kinds of craft jobs; nor does it end the drought of best picture winners that feature two or more women in major speaking roles who also speak to each other. In the last 34 years, that’s happened twice, with “Terms of Endearment” and “Chicago.” We’re talking about a phallocentrism that’s baked into movies and television. It’s the reason we have the Bechdel Test, which asks whether female characters, among other very simple things, meaningfully communicate with each other about something other than a man. Almost no movies pass.

Photo

There’s power in turning to the past to illuminate the current state of things. But there’s different power in the culture now looking at the culture now — or now-ish. The second-season dismount of the Amazon show “One Mississippi” involves a woman’s reaction to an important, sexually creepy male producer. A sensationally complex episode of “Girls” from February — “American Bitch” — puts its protagonist, Hannah Horvath, inside the apartment and on the bed of a famous writer and notorious harasser whom she had visited in order to confront. The best thing about the HBO show “Westworld” is the struggle of female androids to extricate themselves from the limiting fantasies for which they’ve been created. And a major Emmy winner this year was HBO’s “Big Little Lies,” in which a group of frenemies wind up training their focus on an abusive husband. Another was “The Handmaid’s Tale,” on Hulu, about life for women under patriarchal totalitarianism. An idea associated with that show was the same as a hashtag that showed up during the women’s march in January: Resist.

Before this month, I had heard Beyoncé’s “Formation” as a song about, more or less, united, self-protective black feminism. But since the Weinstein news, the chorus sounds more than ever as if it could double as a gender-wide war command: “O.K., ladies now let’s get in formation” — or “let’s get information.” Either way, now I can hear a call for action and solidarity, to be seen and believed.

Still, the persistence of all this combat can leave you weary. That accounts for the mixed emotions of my night at “Battle of the Sexes.” This is a movie about a tennis match that really happened, yet it feels like a fable. When Billie Jean King, who’s played by Emma Stone, wins the first set, cheers broke out in the theater. Actual cheers. I turned around to see who clapped, and one section was filled with women who seemed old enough to remember seeing the match. Celebrating it felt good; it felt just.

It also felt dismayingly recurrent. The movie is called “Battle of the Sexes” but only because somebody already took “Groundhog Day.” And Ms. King is very much a civil rights legend. But, here, she’s also Sisyphus.

So what now? If the entitlements of the Playboy era have suffused our lunch breaks and boardroom meetings and subway rides home, and porn has evolved into something elemental, like fire and water, how do we prevent their personal encroachments and abuses, along with every other important but less salacious imbalance, like for instance, with salaries? How do we reconcile all the complications? “Resist” is one thing. “Change” is something else. Beyoncé is sending that solidarity cry out for ladies. But to get anything meaningful done, more than a few good men are going to have to answer it, too.","Weinstein, Hefner and the Poor Excuse That Explains a Lot",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/weinstein-hefner-and-the-poor-excuse-that-explains-a-lot.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

And it does make for a convenient topic. Egypt’s political parties might disagree on how to remedy any or all of those issues — but homophobia cuts across disagreement. “All political parties here, even the ‘leftist’ ones, think homosexuality is a disgrace,” my friend told me. “Some people think gay people should be stoned, others recommend burning them after stoning, while some sheikhs are saying their hands and legs should be cut on opposite sides of their bodies, and ask in the softest of voices for their imprisonment or deportation.”

But there is more than just distraction at play. A talk-show host who suggested that both terrorism and homosexuality were being used to “ruin our youth” by a nameless external enemy offered perhaps the most honest explanation for this vicious round of homophobia in Egypt: the conflation of a security threat with a “moral” threat.

After the Mashrou’ Leila concert — attended by an estimated 35,000 — a parade of TV personalities pleaded with the regime to “save our youth” from homosexuality. Egyptian authorities promptly barred the group from performing again. In June, Jordan had done the same.

Across the Middle East and North Africa, increasingly bold expressions of sexual freedom are clearly unsettling regimes accustomed to being guardians not just of “national security” but also of our bodies and sexualities. Mr. Sinno is unapologetically “brown, queer and from a Muslim family” by his own description. Mashrou’ Leila, with its sexually subversive songs — which include references to gender fluidity and Abu Nawas, an eighth-century Arab, and Sappho (both known for poems that celebrate same-sex love) — have become icons for a beleaguered but determined L.G.B.T. community and a lightning rod for our moral guardians.

Armed with social media and audacity, more people are questioning taboos around religion and sexuality. There are online L.G.B.T. accounts offering information and solidarity, in Arabic and English. One is the newly formed Alliance of Queer Egyptian Organizations, which coordinated protests outside Egyptian embassies and consulates on Oct. 19. My.Kali, one of the region’s first L.G.B.T. magazines, started publishing in 2008. In July, a video went viral showing an Egyptian lesbian (who lives in the United States) talking about her relationship with a woman and her father’s reaction to her coming out.

Egypt, of course, is far from alone in its witch hunt. From Chechnya to Azerbaijan and from Tanzania to Indonesia there are similar crackdowns by governments obsessed with policing people’s sexuality. (And let’s not forget that President Sisi’s booster, President Trump, is no friend to L.G.B.T. rights.)

Morality crusades unite military regimes and religious zealots alike. Mr. Sisi, a former army general who became president after forcing out Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood, understands the potency of connecting the catchall “national security” to “inciting debauchery” as a deliberate reminder that the Islamists do not hold the copyright on piety. (Mr. Mubarak, too, often vaunted his regime’s religiosity to outdo its Islamist rivals.)

On Oct. 19 — a day of global solidarity with L.G.B.T. Egyptians — I saw Mashrou’ Leila in concert in Montreal. That day, a protest had been held outside the Egyptian Consulate there. Some concertgoers flew an Egyptian flag alongside a rainbow flag. Mr. Sinno told the audience that the best way to fight the crackdown in Egypt was to keep up international pressure. He understands the importance of visibility — for safety and for solidarity.

“Getting just one email from some queer kid in Tunisia who says something super emotional,” Mr. Sinno had told me this summer, after he was banned from performing in Jordan, “even just one of those messages justifies taking on the Jordanian state.” He can now add Egypt to that list of states he’s taking on.",Why Is the Egyptian Government So Afraid of a Rainbow Flag?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/egypt-gay-lgbt-rights.html

The restaurant has a fermentation room, where leftover wine becomes vinegar, and food trimmings participate in homemade soy sauce. The potato bread is made with a starter of fermented potatoes, though home cooks can skip that part. His recipe also recommends saving the potato skins, which find a purpose in the restaurant, though he realizes that a home cook might not use them.

Mr. Orlando is aggressive about sustainability. He helps run local soup kitchens and has classes for children in the garden. “Chefs have such a voice now,” he said. “For a restaurant to mean something, you have to use your power.” But on a day-to-day basis, it’s about using finely tuned taste buds.

And it turns out that it also helps to have a fine recipe that can travel. About a month ago, I was at the Inn at Dos Brisas, about halfway between Houston and Austin.

Indeed, Matt Padilla, the executive chef, had done a stint at Noma when Mr. Orlando was there, and dined at Amass two years ago.

His version of the bread was smaller than the one served at Amass but conveyed the same flaky, buttery, lightly soured character with telltale grill marks. “It’s a great foil for the beef in the tartare,” Mr. Padilla said.

Some Republicans are already pointing to the recent expansion as proof that tax cuts could push the growth rate above 3 percent for years to come — and that just the prospect of that happening is already having an effect.

Mr. Trump made economic growth a political flash point during his campaign and has continued to do so since taking office, promising to reach heights that eluded his predecessor.

“On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent,” Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August. Touting a strong quarter in the spring, when growth hit 3.1 percent, the president suggested that “we’re really on our way” to sustaining that speed year-round.

The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, but economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.

The figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their tax policy: They are celebrating faster growth while claiming tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that the Commerce Department data “reinforces the resilience of the American people.” Republicans, he added, “will deliver on our tax reform promise this year — ushering in a new era of growth.”

Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday that companies were investing more, and driving growth higher, in expectation of a tax cut. Failing to pass a tax bill, he said, would cause growth to slump and markets to tumble.

“If you look at the G.D.P. data, it’s clear that is a major reason why capital spending has increased,” he said, referring to expectations of a tax cut. “If those expectations appear to be incorrect, I would expect capital spending to go back into decline.”

For now, economists are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy’s trajectory.

“There hasn’t been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to that’s fueling the acceleration,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it’s the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.

Ms. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February, has pursued gradual increases of the Fed’s benchmark interest rate in an effort to steer the economy toward steady growth without overheating. The Fed is expected to raise rates when it meets in December. Mr. Trump is publicly weighing whether to replace Ms. Yellen, considering two possible successors, but has also signaled that he may decide to renominate her.

“Markets would probably applaud her reappointment,” Mr. Anderson said.

Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust rate of 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were “a sign that consumers are hanging tough.”

At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased.

Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. Businesses may be investing in computers and industrial equipment in response to a tight labor market and rising wages, economists said.

“Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,” Mr. Anderson said.

Hurricanes can disrupt an economy in obvious ways — ruining homes, incapacitating infrastructure, and slowing the flow of goods across the country. The Houston metropolitan area is the country’s fifth largest, accounting for 3 percent of national economic output, and the severe flooding brought on by Hurricane Harvey had an immediate impact on employment. The country’s economy shed 33,000 jobs in September, the first monthly drop in seven years.

But after the negative shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.

“If you don’t go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.”

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left 600,000 to one million vehicles needing replacement, according to Cox Automotive, and Americans rushed to dealerships to recoup what they had lost. Car sales spiked in September, reaching their highest level since 2005.

The growth figure released on Friday was the government’s first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. It can be hard to accurately measure the full effect of a natural disaster immediately after it occurs, and so these numbers could swing up or down when the department revisits the period.

Chasing Growth The United States has been a pace setter among developed economies, but Europe is no longer a laggard. Annual rate of change in G.D.P. + 4 % U.S. + 2 Japan 0 European Union – 2 – 4 – 6 ’05 ’10 ’15 ’16

The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.

“This is happening globally,” Mr. Zandi, the Moody’s economist, said. “There isn’t a single major economy that is in recession.”

A weak dollar has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for Finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex. a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international.

“Things are picking up — I sense it in Europe,” Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filters down to rural communities. “Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,” he said.","U.S. Economy Grew at 3% Rate in 3rd Quarter, Despite Storms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/economy/economy-quarter-gdp.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Mr. Trump, who has indulged in his own wild speculation about the sensational killing, had expressed eagerness to finally open the last of the government files, only to run into a last-minute campaign by intelligence agencies to redact certain documents. Grudgingly, he gave the agencies until April 26 to go through the remaining papers again and make their case.

“I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” Mr. Trump said in a memo to the agencies. Given their objections, he said, “I have no choice — today — but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation’s security.” But he ordered the agencies to “be extremely circumspect,” noting that the rationale for secrecy has only “grown weaker with the passage of time.”

For conspiracy theorists, the Kennedy assassination has been the holy grail, one that has produced an endless string of books, reports, lectures, articles, websites, documentaries and big-screen Hollywood movies. It was the first murder of an American president in the television age, touching off a wave of global grief for a charismatic young leader while also spawning a cottage industry of skeptical questioning of the official version of events.

Every government authority that has examined the investigation of his death, from the Warren Commission to congressional investigators, concluded that Kennedy was killed by Oswald, who fired three shots with a mail-order rifle from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository when the presidential motorcade passed by on Nov. 22, 1963. But that has never satisfied the doubters, and polls have consistently shown that most Americans still believe that someone other than Oswald must have been involved.

While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said in a 1979 report that Kennedy “was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy” but did not identify who those conspirators might have been. It ruled out the Soviet and Cuban governments, organized Cubans opposing Fidel Castro, the Mafia, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Secret Service, although the committee said it could not preclude that individuals affiliated with some of those groups might have been involved.

Among the doubters have been Mr. Trump, who last year alleged that the father of one of his Republican presidential primary rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the assassination. The president’s longtime friend and adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. wrote a book accusing Johnson of being responsible for the shooting that elevated him to the presidency.

As it happened, Mr. Trump’s deferral to the C.I.A. and F.B.I. invariably will lead to suspicions that the government is still protecting sensational secrets about the case. Administration officials said there was no cover-up, just an effort to avoid compromising national security, law enforcement or intelligence gathering methods.

The C.I.A., which for years has borne the brunt of suspicions from amateur assassination theorists, went out of its way on Thursday to try to dispel concerns that it was hiding important evidence.

The agency issued a statement noting that the vast majority of assassination-related records have been released, and that redactions were intended “to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security — including the names of C.I.A. assets and current and former C.I.A. officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today.”

The release of the documents owes as much to the moviemaker Oliver Stone as anyone else. After his 1991 conspiracy theory movie “J.F.K.” stoked renewed interest, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which was signed into law by President George Bush on Oct. 26, 1992. The act mandated that all assassination records be released no later than 25 years from that date, which was Thursday, unless the president authorized further withholding for national security reasons.

In the years since the law was passed, the National Archives and Records Administration has released 88 percent of those documents in full and an additional 11 percent with portions redacted. Until Thursday, just 1 percent had been withheld in full.

Of the 2,891 documents released Thursday, only 53 had never been disclosed by the archives; the rest had been made public with redactions.

The papers range widely, and while many are not directly related to the assassination, others add context. One recounted the reaction of the Soviet Union to the killing, reporting that some in Moscow assumed it was a “coup” by the “ultraright” that would be blamed on the Soviet Union. An unnamed informant told American spies that the K.G.B. had proof that “President Johnson was responsible for the assassination.”

An F.B.I. cable from April 1964 reconstructed Oswald’s bus trip to Mexico weeks before the assassination, including the names of the people sitting around him and even what he was wearing: “a short-sleeved light colored sport shirt and no coat.”

In Hoover’s memo two days after the assassination, he expressed anxiety that Oswald’s killing would generate doubts among Americans. “The thing I am concerned about,” he wrote, “is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.” The F.B.I. director also fretted that discoveries that Oswald contacted the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington could “complicate our foreign relations.”

He called the Oswald killing “inexcusable” in light of “our warnings to the Dallas Police Department” and hinted at Ruby’s mob connections, which would soon spawn an industry of research and speculation. “We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago,” Hoover wrote.

The documents will not end the debate or speculation — and a few may add to the questions. In a 1975 deposition, for example, Richard Helms, the former C.I.A. director, was asked: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an agen…”

But the document ends there, and Mr. Helms’s answer is missing.","J.F.K. Files, Though Incomplete, Are a Treasure Trove for Answer Seekers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-jfk-release.html?target=comments#commentsContainer

That success has buoyed the wealth of Mr. Tsai: Forbes estimates that he is currently worth about $9 billion.

He has already spent some of his wealth in sports, an interest of his dating back to his time as a lacrosse player at Yale. In August, he bought the San Diego expansion team of the nascent National Lacrosse League for what Bloomberg News reported was a $5 million price tag.

The acquisition is the latest example of an executive from a Chinese conglomerate — or a Chinese company itself — spending heavily to snap up sports properties, ranging from Premier League teams such as Manchester City and Birmingham to top European teams such as AC Milan and Atletico Madrid. They have also invested in FIFA sponsorships and in companies that handle international broadcast and media rights.

With a population of 1.3 billion people and a rising middle class with an unquenchable thirst for sports, China is considered a lucrative and largely untapped market for both consuming and participating in sports.

But deals such as Dalian Wanda’s $650 million purchase of the Ironman competition and its expansion into marathons and road races have been questioned by analysts for the high prices that have been agreed. Buyers from China and Chinese companies have also pumped money into everything from professional cricket to world snooker tournaments and cycling.

In March, the Chinese government acknowledged that its companies had gone on a buying spree abroad, spending $225 billion in 2016, a record-breaking number. Commerce Minister Zhong Shan vowed to slow down what he called “blind and irrational investment.”

Zhou Xiaochuan, the country’s top central banker, took particular aim at sports and entertainment acquisitions.

“Some are not in line with our requirements and policies for overseas investment, such as in sports, entertainment and clubs,” he said. “This didn’t bring much benefit to China and caused some complaints overseas.”

Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.","“Even today,” Gary R. Brown, the magistrate judge who oversaw the settlement of that crash, wrote in June, the victims were still grappling with “getting on with the difficult process of healing.”

The 50 passengers were from all over: India, Romania, Turkey, Ecuador, Australia as well as New York, New Jersey and California. They included students and sisters-in-law, single friends and married couples. Among them were newlyweds from Algeria.

The three-day excursion, arranged by E-World Travel & Tours, began in Manhattan with a stop planned in Niagara Falls. The tour was meant to head on to Washington and then to Philadelphia, but the bus broke down in upstate New York, forcing the passengers to wait for hours at a shopping mall until a replacement, a 1996 Setra, showed up.

The whirlwind nature of the trip was magnified by the tight schedule set by E-World and the breakneck pace kept by the Setra’s driver, Jinli Zhao, whose erratic driving had unnerved many passengers.

Mr. Zhao seemed irritated, angry, even rude, often rushing the passengers at rest stops, some of them later reported. At least once when a passenger returned late to the bus, Mr. Zhao began to drive away, as though he meant to leave them, one passenger told the police.

Mr. Zhao also seemed distracted behind the wheel. He would eat while driving, passengers recalled. He argued frequently with the tour guide and constantly downed energy drinks. And he was frequently on his cellphone, they said.

He veered near cars in adjacent lanes, accelerated dangerously and then stepped on the brakes, passengers said, cutting off other vehicles. He shifted lanes at such high speed that one passenger said he felt the bus swaying back and forth.

The tour guide, Allan Ge, told the passengers that Mr. Zhao had not slept in a while, Melis Seker, a Turkish college student who was then 19, later told the police. Mr. Ge told the group that “if the police ever stopped the bus and found that the driver had not had enough sleep, then they would be forced to stay and rest,” Ms. Seker said.

The crash occurred on a stretch of roadway in Delaware that investigators said the driver was unfamiliar with. Confronted with traffic on Interstate 95, he and Mr. Ge decided to take a different route. Mr. Zhao consulted his GPS and turned onto a long, curving off-ramp leading from State Route 1 toward U.S. Route 13.

As they pulled onto the ramp, several people stood up and shouted for the driver to slow down, one passenger told the police. When the bus began to tip, luggage tumbled from the overhead racks. People started screaming.

An Algerian man, Karim Fellahi, who was with his wife, Ihssene Kerchouche, on their honeymoon, remembered seeing the driver lose control.

“I just had the time to say to Ihssene, ‘Be ready for the impact,’” Mr. Fellahi, 36, testified, “because we were sure that we are going to die. We closed our eyes and we waited to die.”

The bus was off the road now, careening into a sloping area of bushes. It went upside-down, turned on its roof and skidded partway down a grassy embankment, rolling again and landing with a shudder on the driver’s side.

Moments later, Mr. Fellahi said, he opened his eyes to a barely identifiable structure. “I couldn’t recognize the roof,” he said. Ms. Kerchouche, 29, had disappeared; even her seat was gone.

“I heard her screaming my name,” Mr. Fellahi said. “It was like she was far, very far, from me.”

He found his wife outside the bus, facedown in the dirt and covered by other passengers. Her mangled right forearm was dangling, connected to the rest of her arm by a piece of skin.

Another passenger testified that she and her sister were propelled through the air at the moment of the crash, flying forward and slamming into people and broken bus parts.

She could not move her arms or legs and felt an unbearable pain in her pelvis, which had been fractured by a large piece of metal.

The Delaware State Police arrived to a scene of carnage: a twisted metal shell and dozens of bodies strewn around it. A 400-foot-long trail of tire marks streaked across the road.

As passengers struggled to escape, Eyup Bahsi, a 30-year-old Turkish man, looked in vain for his wife, Idil. Also 30, she had been sitting in the window seat beside him. Mr. Bahsi finally found her, conscious and seated with her legs pinned underneath the bus. She was trying to pull herself free.

Ms. Bahsi was also having trouble breathing, Mr. Bahsi said, and he gently helped her lie on her back. He tried to clear her mouth of dirt.

She squeezed his hand, opened and closed her eyes and tried to speak, but Mr. Bahsi said that he could not make out the words. He sought to reassure his wife, telling her to just stay calm, that an ambulance was on its way. Ms. Bahsi eventually reached a hospital, where she underwent several operations. She died later that night.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the crash was excessive speed. Mr. Zhao, the driver, claimed that he was feeling ill before the crash and had “blacked out.” But the safety board said that the evidence suggested he was not incapacitated.

The board eventually determined that Mr. Zhao had driven a total of 14¾ hours that Saturday, exceeding the 10-hour federal limit. He also did not have the requisite eight hours off before he set out on the road again.

The board found that the driver’s cellphone records showed he was routinely making and receiving calls and was using his voice mail when the bus was moving, although not when it crashed.

Mr. Zhao, 56, later pleaded guilty to three counts of operating a vehicle causing death and received probation, Delaware court records show.

This month, when a reporter visited his apartment in Queens, Mr. Zhao loomed silently in the background as a young man, who did not give his name but said he was Mr. Zhao’s son, stood in the doorway. He said his father was so “scarred” by the crash that he hardly spoke of it, even to his family.

“What’s past is past,” the son added.

During the litigation, Mr. Zhao was deposed by victims’ lawyers. He testified that when he arrived from New York to fetch the tour group in the Setra, he informed the guide, Mr. Ge, that he was already “very tired.” Mr. Zhao said he had explained to Mr. Ge that if they kept to their plan, his hours would be “a lot over the limit.” He said that Mr. Ge responded there was “nothing he could do.”

In an interview, Mr. Ge said that he did not recall Mr. Zhao looking “really tired.” An E-World supervisor, David Lo, described the travel agency as “an innocent victim” in the crash. “We cannot control the driver,” Mr. Lo said. “We cannot control the bus company.”

The bus was insured for $5 million — the minimum required by law. The insurers filed court papers saying they anticipated that the claims from the crash would exceed their policies, and they ultimately deposited the full $5 million with the court and left Judge Brown to allocate it.

Lawyers for the victims said that this approach, while hardly ideal, was nonetheless their best chance to compensate their clients. The lawyers had learned that AM USA Express had sold its remaining three buses and gone out of business; E-World, they said, also had few assets.

The process was designed to avoid a lengthy court fight, but because the pool of money was limited, it meant that if some passengers got more, others would get less. “On a certain level, it’s a zero-sum game,” said Brian M. Levy, a lawyer for 21 of the claimants.

In order to understand the impact of the crash, Judge Brown held two days of investigative hearings in April. What had previously been a dry legal matter suddenly became excruciatingly human.

Around 10:30 a.m. on April 26, several of the victims — some having traveled from continents away — filed into the courtroom in Central Islip, N.Y. Judge Brown had set out boxes of tissues, and as the day went on, he stopped the proceedings several times to apologize.

“I understand this was a horrific event,” he said, “and we’re going to do everything we can to get you through this as painlessly as possible.”

The first witness was Shilpa Lagishetty, who told the judge that she had suffered a traumatic injury to her right eye socket. Even after surgery, Ms. Lagishetty said, she had constant headaches and could no longer see things that were more than two feet away.

There had also been an emotional toll. “I still have sleepless nights,” she said. On the morning of the crash, she recounted, a woman had asked her to swap seats; she did. The woman died in the crash, she said, beginning to cry.

“I’m so depressed,” she added. “That lady had a son. I can’t imagine me in that position.”

Addressing the judge next was Mr. Bahsi, who had flown to New York from Turkey. He spoke through an interpreter, recounting how his wife had been trapped beneath the bus and died that night in the hospital.

“She was my everything,” he said, “and she was my best friend and she was my best companion.” He added: “It’s difficult. It’s — you know, to come as two individuals and to go back basically with a coffin.”

The next to testify were the Algerian honeymooners, Ms. Kerchouche and Mr. Fellahi. After the crash, Ms. Kerchouche had numerous surgeries as doctors struggled to repair her right arm, which had suffered extensive nerve and vascular damage, and her other injuries. She ultimately faced several hundred thousand dollars in medical bills. Unable to travel, she and Mr. Fellahi had to stay in the United States for more than four months as she recovered. Ms. Kerchouche, who worked for a bank, could not return to work.

Not long after the crash, Ms. Kerchouche got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy. But she could not hold her child, she testified, because one of her arms was permanently locked at a 90-degree angle. Nor could she write, drive a car or turn a door handle, she said. In time, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic-stress disorder.

“She’s like living, but dead in the same time,” her husband told the judge.

Ms. Seker, the Turkish college student, was unable to come to court, but she sent a letter to her lawyer, Jordan K. Merson, who read it to the judge. In the letter, Ms. Seker said the crash’s impact on her life had been endless. She was in constant pain — the crash broke both of her shoulders and some of her ribs, and she was left with a collapsed lung and other fractures. She had nightmares and was now afraid to sleep.

“Sometimes,” she wrote, “I wake up and feel like I am being thrown, like I was on the bus.”

In a recent interview, Ms. Seker said that before the crash, she had been training to be a competitive swimmer and also loved playing volleyball. Now she cannot engage in either sport.

“They said probably I will never be able to do them again,” she said. Like Ms. Kerchouche, she had also stayed in the United States for more than a month to recover, in her case forcing her to miss a semester of school.

In the courtroom, Judge Brown appeared perplexed by the challenge of comparing these cases.

“How do I do this?” he asked Ms. Seker’s lawyer, Mr. Merson. The judge cited Ms. Kerchouche’s case, mentioning her damaged arm. “She can’t hold her baby,” he said. “She can’t feel anything.”",‘Everyone Lost Something’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/bus-crash-underinsured-victims-compensation.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

tl;dr: Mondays are the easiest and they get harder as the week goes on.

This is probably a beginning solver’s most common mistake.

You know what it’s like: You have some downtime on a Saturday and you look around for something to pass the time. Your officemate keeps bragging about his ability to finish The New York Times Crossword. You hate your officemate.

So, not to be outdone, you pick up the paper or download our app and turn to the Saturday puzzle. How hard could it be?

Fun Fact: The Saturday crossword is actually the hardest puzzle of the week. Contrary to popular belief, the Sunday puzzles are midweek difficulty, not the hardest. Mondays have the most straightforward clues and Saturday clues are the most vague or involve the most wordplay. Some later-week puzzle clues may require specialized knowledge.

Just to drive the point home, let’s take a look at the difference between a Monday clue and a late-week clue for a popular crossword entry. OREO cookies (answers in puzzles are generally written in all capital letters) are such a popular entry in crosswords that they have been dubbed by some as the “official” cookie of the crossword. A typical Monday clue for OREO will be very straightforward and drive you almost directly to the answer.

“Nabisco cookie”

“Cookie with creme filling”

“‘Twist, Lick, Dunk’ cookie”

And here are some late-week clues, which might require more specialized knowledge about these delicious treats:

“Snack since 1912”

“It has 12 flowers on each side”

“Sandwich often given a twist”

We weren’t kidding you. There is a big difference between a Monday puzzle and a Saturday puzzle.

That doesn’t mean that you can’t work your way toward solving a late-week puzzle – and we recommend that you do, because they’re fun – but it takes experience and patience.

If you’re just getting started, though, make your life easy and solve as many Monday puzzles as you can. Eventually, you’ll be ready for more of a challenge, and that’s when you move on to Tuesday puzzles.

“I don’t think that’s a very good way to pick a Fed chair, so I declined to participate,” said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, an increasingly outspoken critic of Mr. Trump’s style of governance.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought advice from a TV personality, turning the tables on Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network in the middle of an interview.

“Tell me who your preference is,” Mr. Trump said. He pressed repeatedly for an answer from the visibly flustered host. Mr. Dobbs finally endorsed Ms. Yellen.

Mr. Trump responded: “She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it’s somebody that I am thinking about.” But, he continued, “I have to say you’d like to make your own mark,” suggesting that he might be inclined to nominate someone else.

The White House would like to announce a final decision by Nov. 3.

Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the most unusual aspect of Mr. Trump’s deliberations was the diversity of the candidates.

Presidents generally decide what kind of chairman they want and then pick a nominee.

President Jimmy Carter, who chose twice, first decided that he wanted an industrial executive, settling on G. William Miller, the head of Textron. Nearly 17 months later, deciding he wanted someone respected by financial markets, Mr. Carter picked Paul Volcker.

President Ronald Reagan renominated Mr. Volcker, then chose Alan Greenspan, draining the drama from the process for almost two decades. In 2003, President George W. Bush offered Mr. Greenspan a fifth term a year before the end of his fourth term.

When Mr. Greenspan retired in 2006, Mr. Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke from a list of three Ivy League economists who had served as Republican policy advisers.

President Barack Obama renominated Mr. Bernanke, then sought a replacement among Democratic economists who embraced the Fed’s power to reduce unemployment. Supporters of Ms. Yellen and her main rival, Lawrence H. Summers, battled publicly, but it was a contest over personalities, not ideas.

Mr. Trump’s choice, by contrast, could have significant consequences for the direction of Fed policy. Mr. Powell, who supported the Fed’s efforts to stimulate economic growth, now favors a gradual unwinding of those policies. Mr. Taylor opposed the stimulus campaign, and he has called for the Fed to retreat more quickly.

“If you’re taking seriously reappointing Yellen or nominating Powell, well, that’s light years away from Taylor,” Ms. Binder said. “It just raises the question: What is the basis on which the president is conducting the search?”

One possible explanation is that Mr. Trump is struggling with the imperatives of a polarized political environment. He has repeatedly praised Ms. Yellen for her performance as Fed chairwoman. The economy is growing and the stock market is rising, and Mr. Trump wants both trends to continue. But conservatives are pressing Mr. Trump to seize the opportunity to shift the approach of the central bank by appointing Mr. Taylor.

Three House Republicans, including Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday pressing for new leadership at the Fed. Republicans want to constrain the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy, and to install a Fed chairman who is supportive of efforts to reduce financial regulation.

Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, favor the nomination of Mr. Powell as a kind of middle road: a Republican likely to maintain the Fed’s course on monetary policy, but with greater sympathy for relaxing financial regulation.

Ms. Binder said that replacing Ms. Yellen would reinforce the growing tendency to view the Fed as a partisan political institution, with every president picking a new chairman.

“If anything is being broken here it’s the norm of bipartisan continuity at the Fed, and it is always to the Fed’s benefit to look bipartisan and to be bipartisan,” she said. “It raises fewer questions about what is motivating the Fed’s choice of monetary policy.”

But Peter Conti-Brown, a legal studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is writing a political history of the Fed, said that Mr. Trump was simply making explicit the longstanding reality that presidents seek to influence the course of monetary policy.

Indeed, Mr. Conti-Brown said he saw a silver lining in Mr. Trump’s showmanship, and in the diversity of the candidates, because it was providing a rare opportunity for the public to compare and debate different views of the Fed’s role in the economy.

“I think it’s all to the very good to generate discussion about what the Fed is, what the different approaches are, whether they’re good or bad,” he said. “This is the only time the public gets to weigh in. If you don’t think the Fed should operate in the shadowy corners of the administrative state, this is exactly what accountability looks like.”",Trump’s Latest Show: Choosing a Fed Chairman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-fed-chairman.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

He said the administration would produce “really big, really great advertising” aimed at young people because, “If we can teach young people not to take drugs, it’s really, really easy not to take them.” This is sloganeering reminiscent of the ineffective, Reagan-era “Just Say No” programs, when the ravages of drug abuse in black and Hispanic communities were treated with harsh punishment, rather than the empathy and care that is being called for today.

Deaths from opioid overdoses have more than tripled since 2002. As of 2015, an estimated two million Americans were addicted to prescription opioids, and nearly 600,000 to heroin. Opioid addiction rose most swiftly among white, middle-class Americans, though it now spares no state, race or income group. Efforts to treat the disease have nearly bankrupted people whose insurance falls short. Financial constraints often prevent uninsured people from seeking treatment at all. The Affordable Care Act improved access to addiction treatment by expanding Medicaid, which covers three in 10 non-elderly adults with an opioid addiction. Yet the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to repeal the law or slash its benefits.

At least Mr. Trump said on Thursday that the administration planned to roll back a rule preventing Medicaid funding from being used for treatment in large inpatient addiction facilities, a recommendation made by the opioids commission in late July.

But it is still not clear who will lead the response to the epidemic, since Mr. Trump has yet to appoint a number of officials who could do so. He was forced to withdraw his nominee to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Representative Tom Marino, Republican of Pennsylvania, after news emerged that Mr. Marino had helped drug wholesalers make it harder for the Drug Enforcement Administration to crack down on black-market opioid distribution. Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s former health and human services secretary, lost his job because of his use of private jets.

The opioids commission’s final recommendations are scheduled to be released on Wednesday, but the administration has yet to act on most of the commission’s interim recommendations. “I still have not seen the passion for this epidemic that I saw in the AIDS epidemic,” Gov. Chris Christie, the commission’s chairman, said recently.

There are some in the administration who do seem to get it: In a hearing this week, Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, advocated expanding the use of medication-assisted treatments, such as methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, citing evidence that they are effective in reducing overdose deaths.

One would have hoped that Mr. Trump would be eager to deliver real relief for an epidemic that affects millions of American families.

2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History We tracked horror’s rise at the box office over the decades. This year, led by “It” and “Get Out,” really has outpaced all others.

This year, scary clowns, scary dolls and scary suburbanites have drawn audiences to the movies in droves. Even with two months remaining, 2017 has already become the biggest box office year ever for horror. Scary movies have collected $733 million in ticket sales, according to the website Box Office Mojo . The runaway success of “ It ” (more than $300 million and counting) and “ Get Out ” ($175 million) led the way, but October is a golden month for horror and will surely add more to that tally. “Happy Death Day” was No. 1 when it opened this month (on Friday the 13th), and a new entry in the hit “Saw” franchise, “Jigsaw” (due Oct. 27), should also raise the total.

How has horror fared at the box office in previous decades? Going back to the 1970s, I used data from Box Office Mojo to track the genre’s rise as a moneymaking force, focusing on one key year from each decade. Box Office Mojo breaks horror down into 10 subcategories on its site and its editor, Brad Brevet, has struggled with the question of what constitutes a horror movie. He tried to bring some clarity with a new list. “When ‘It’ came out I created an R-rated horror list on Mojo,” he wrote in an email. “That, at least, felt representative of the horror genre.”

We used the R-rated list as a reference point, but the highest-grossing year for each decade is based on figures collected from all the films the site considers horror. Also, these numbers have not been adjusted for inflation (which would turn “The Exorcist” into a $983 million earner).

The 1970s

Biggest Year: 1973, $232.9 million

In the early 1970s, horror broke into the mainstream in a big way, primarily with the astronomical success of “The Exorcist” in 1973, which alone topped the collective total of any box office year in the decade. That movie aside, horror didn’t make much of an impression that year. And it was really films released later in the decade that would prove pivotal. The popularity of “Halloween” in 1978 ($47 million) showed that slasher films could be a force. And 1979 brought the blockbuster haunted house scares of “The Amityville Horror” ($86.4 million) and the influential space scares of “Alien” ($80.9 million). That film captured a mass audience with a return of sorts to the creature features of classic horror.

The 1980s

Biggest Year: 1987, $293.6 million

The slasher genre came into its own in the ’80s, with the introduction of Jason in “Friday the 13th” (1980) and Freddy in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” (1984). Those franchises produced buckets of blood and cash ($380.6 million total for “Friday” and $370.5 million for “Elm Street”). 1987 was one of the decade’s most profitable. “Elm Street” was in its third installment ($44 million), “The Lost Boys” added young vampire thrills to the mix ($32 million) and the action horror of “Predator” (a movie that probably wouldn’t have existed without the success of “Alien”) brought in strong numbers ($59 million).

The 1990s

Biggest Year: 1999, $574.6 million

The early part of the ’90s saw few major horror blockbusters. Daniel Loria, the editorial director of Boxoffice Media , cites the rise of home video in the late ’80s as the reason for the dip. In a phone interview, he said that many horror films bypassed theaters for home video. “A B-side horror film like ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’ might not have played in theaters had it been made in the late ’80s or early ’90s,” he said. “It might have just gone straight to video for a quick buck.” Things looked up in the latter half of the decade, with the revival of the slasher genre through the “Scream” franchise ($331.7 million). And then, 1999 brought a new revolution via “The Blair Witch Project,” a lowest-of-budgets found-footage movie shot on video that scared up a phenomenal $140.5 million, along with many copycats.

The Aughts

Biggest Year: 2000, $617.7 million

The 2000s began by coasting on a wave of “Scream” popularity. While that franchise added sequels, the 2000 parody “Scary Movie” pulled in $157 million. (It ranked No. 9 for the year, followed by the high-end horror drama “What Lies Beneath” at No. 10.) Later during this decade, found footage was replaced by slick yet gruesome torture horror like the “Saw” films, which have taken in $415.9 million so far. And reboots of earlier horror movies became a trend. 2009 featured a number of these films, including a reboot of “Friday the 13th,” a sequel to a reboot of “Halloween” and the sixth entry in the “Saw” series. But the jaw-dropper that year was“Paranormal Activity.” A return to low-budget found footage, the film had a $15,000 production budget , according to Box Office Mojo, and made $107.9 million.

2017 has seen several strong performers from one of the most successful contemporary horror producers around, Jason Blum (“Get Out,” “Split,” “Happy Death Day”). But the biggest story is the tremendous run of “It.” That Stephen King adaptation perked up the domestic box office after a dismal August, and not even box office experts predicted just how well the movie would perform. Mr. Loria of Boxoffice Media said his team forecast an $81 million opening weekend. The real number was $123 million. He said they look at social media mentions to see how vocal audiences are being about a title. “When it came to ‘It,’” Mr. Loria said, “it was just really difficult to track the word ‘It’ across social media to get the snapshot we needed.”",2017: The Biggest Year in Horror History,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/movies/top-horror-movies-box-office-it-get-out.html

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

Some Republicans are already pointing to the recent expansion as proof that tax cuts could push the growth rate above 3 percent for years to come — and that just the prospect of that happening is already having an effect.

Mr. Trump made economic growth a political flash point during his campaign and has continued to do so since taking office, promising to reach heights that eluded his predecessor.

“On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent,” Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August. Touting a strong quarter in the spring, when growth hit 3.1 percent, the president suggested that “we’re really on our way” to sustaining that speed year-round.

The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, but economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.

The figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their tax policy: They are celebrating faster growth while claiming tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that the Commerce Department data “reinforces the resilience of the American people.” Republicans, he added, “will deliver on our tax reform promise this year — ushering in a new era of growth.”

Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday that companies were investing more, and driving growth higher, in expectation of a tax cut. Failing to pass a tax bill, he said, would cause growth to slump and markets to tumble.

“If you look at the G.D.P. data, it’s clear that is a major reason why capital spending has increased,” he said, referring to expectations of a tax cut. “If those expectations appear to be incorrect, I would expect capital spending to go back into decline.”

For now, economists are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy’s trajectory.

“There hasn’t been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to that’s fueling the acceleration,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it’s the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.

Ms. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February, has pursued gradual increases of the Fed’s benchmark interest rate in an effort to steer the economy toward steady growth without overheating. The Fed is expected to raise rates when it meets in December. Mr. Trump is publicly weighing whether to replace Ms. Yellen, considering two possible successors, but has also signaled that he may decide to renominate her.

“Markets would probably applaud her reappointment,” Mr. Anderson said.

Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust rate of 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were “a sign that consumers are hanging tough.”

At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased.

Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. Businesses may be investing in computers and industrial equipment in response to a tight labor market and rising wages, economists said.

“Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,” Mr. Anderson said.

Hurricanes can disrupt an economy in obvious ways — ruining homes, incapacitating infrastructure, and slowing the flow of goods across the country. The Houston metropolitan area is the country’s fifth largest, accounting for 3 percent of national economic output, and the severe flooding brought on by Hurricane Harvey had an immediate impact on employment. The country’s economy shed 33,000 jobs in September, the first monthly drop in seven years.

But after the negative shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.

“If you don’t go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy.”

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left 600,000 to one million vehicles needing replacement, according to Cox Automotive, and Americans rushed to dealerships to recoup what they had lost. Car sales spiked in September, reaching their highest level since 2005.

The growth figure released on Friday was the government’s first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. It can be hard to accurately measure the full effect of a natural disaster immediately after it occurs, and so these numbers could swing up or down when the department revisits the period.

Chasing Growth The United States has been a pace setter among developed economies, but Europe is no longer a laggard. Annual rate of change in G.D.P. + 4 % U.S. + 2 Japan 0 European Union – 2 – 4 – 6 ’05 ’10 ’15 ’16

The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.

“This is happening globally,” Mr. Zandi, the Moody’s economist, said. “There isn’t a single major economy that is in recession.”

A weak dollar has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for Finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex. a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international.

“Things are picking up — I sense it in Europe,” Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filters down to rural communities. “Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,” he said.","U.S. Economy Grew at 3% Rate in 3rd Quarter, Despite Storms",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/economy/economy-quarter-gdp.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

卡内帕说，批评者们担心人身自由方面的问题，他们对新想法的适应很慢。“但人们最终会了解它在公共安全方面的价值，”他补充说。“这个立法很实际，而且符合我们的日常认知。它是能救命的法。”

至少有10个州已就行人或骑行人注意力不集中进行了类似的立法辩论；然而根据全美州议会联合会(National Conference of State Legislatures)统计，没有一个州通过类似法案。该联合会表示，相关立法在两个州内尚待表决，9月份，纽约州通过一项法律，要求纽约市研究如何让公众明白，在行走时注意力不集中是有危险的。

Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times 旧金山联合广场一带边走路边发短信的行人。

市级法律是不受追踪的，但是于2011年通过相关法律的艾奥瓦州雷克斯堡可能是最早在全市范围实施禁令的城市。该市一个人口集中地区在很短时期内就有五名行人死亡。对于一个大约只有3.5万名居民的城市来说，这个死亡率相当高 。

雷克斯堡市检察官史蒂芬·佐林格(Stephen Zollinger)说：“这对我们的系统来说是一种震撼。”

人们怀疑行走时注意力不集中是罪魁祸首。除了采取其他安全措施，雷克斯堡还禁止行人在过马路时使用手持装置——除非是正在打电话，佐林格说，“从那以后，我们这里就再也没有行人在交通事故中死亡。”

博德赫拉芬是阿姆斯特丹附近的一个小镇，它尝试了另一种做法。今年，它在一条繁忙的十字路口的人行横道上嵌入了条形LED灯，盯着手机的人过马路时也能看见。当交通信号灯变成红色或绿色时，地面上的灯也会随之变色，还能在马路可以安全通行时提醒行人。

该项目负责人、荷兰交通工程师杜尔夫·卢登堡(Dolf Roodenburg)说，这个试点计划旨在预测趋势，而不是扭转趋势。如果取得成功，该市希望在更多十字路口和自行车道上安装这种LED灯，并将它们提供给其他城市。

在德国的奥格斯堡，去年曾有一个年轻人在横穿电车轨道时使用智能手机，结果被电车撞倒，受了重伤，之后该市也安装了类似的LED灯。

Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times 旧金山某管理公司首席执行官查尔斯·钱·麦西。他说，边走路边使用智能手机这种事“我也会干”。“很多人都这么做；他们知道这是有风险的，可还是这么做了，”他还说。

当然，也有人认为，对行人进行立法约束并不会产生成效。

前纽约市交通运输部(New York City Department of Transportation)部长、现任彭博合伙人公司(Bloomberg Associates)运输主管的珍尼特·萨迪克-汗(Janette Sadik-Khan)表示，立法禁止边走路边发短信不能解决问题，该公司专门向世界各地的市长提供咨询。她说，这样的立法没有任何研究作为依据，设计欠佳，把人们的注意力从道路设计问题和司机行为问题上引开，而这两点才是大多数交通事故的原因。

“这是一个偷懒的办法。进行工程改造更为困难，但效率更高，”萨迪克-汗说。“对于政府来说，建立在可靠分析上的交通安全是一件非常严肃的事情。”",在火奴鲁鲁，过马路时看手机请交35美元,https://cn.nytstyle.com/international/20171025/honolulu-walking-and-texting-fine/

In their infancy and well into the first 80 years or so of the 20th century, department stores were largely places to pass the hours. When Lord & Taylor opened on Fifth Avenue and 38th Street it featured three dining rooms, a manicure parlor for men and a mechanical horse that could walk, trot or canter. Harry Gordon Selfridge, founder of Selfridges in London, dictated that “a store should be a social center.” To that end he installed an ice rink and shooting range on the roof of his store and exhibited the first plane to fly over the English Channel.

During this period, shopping as the consummate theatrical experience was memorialized in art. Florine Stettheimer’s 1921 painting “Spring Sale at Bendel’s,” to cite one example, shows us no cashiers, no scrambling for discounted Jazz Age style. In rich reds, it delivers the sense of a decadent party. Émile Zola’s novel “The Ladies’ Paradise” chronicled the rise of the Parisian department store in the 19th century, with its reading rooms and varied enticements.

Today, of course, shopping is something else entirely, not a diversion but just an extension of our working or “productive” lives. At our desks and laptops we buy our avocados, face creams, bathing suits, boxer shorts, coffee tables, routers, sport coats, ski clothes. We can spend $53 or $8,500. There is nothing to immortalize unless you are a writer or artist moved to render the image of an exhausted-looking middle-aged woman staring at a screen-full of Amazon reviews.

With the rise of the internet, shopping came to look like work, and work, in many instances came to look like leisure, which is why WeWork’s purchase of the Lord & Taylor building has a resonance beyond the obvious. WeWork leases office space to small but growing companies giving them shared access to communal rooms that look like lounges with bars, air-hockey tables, lemon-infused water and so on.

“WeWork’s mission is to help people make a life, not just a living,’’ as one of its executives recently explained in a news release. The tech sensibility, which has leaked into so many other industries, imagines distinctions between work and private life as benighted. You are always working — posting to Instagram your vacation pictures in Bali, where you also happen to be sourcing materials for your new app-distributed small-furniture line — and you are always living.

You could, in fact, build an entire social life around the WeWork experience. There are events all the time. Next week, for instance, a branch of WeWork in Dallas will hold a fashion show to benefit an animal protection charity. The show is to be followed by drinks, manicures and the opportunity to adopt a dog. There are WeWork offices in Haifa, Israel; Tokyo; Buenos Aires and 53 other cities now.

It’s the worst drug overdose epidemic in American history, spurred by rising drug abuse, increased availability of prescription opioids and an influx of potent synthetics like fentanyl and carfentanil. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.

“It’s horrifying,” said Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a heroin researcher and a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “It’s not even the magnitude — it’s the steepness at which it’s climbing.” Preliminary numbers for 2017 suggest that overdose deaths are growing at a rate comparable to the height of the H.I.V. epidemic.

The opioid epidemic has not fallen equally on all races or regions. Like an infectious disease, drug overdoses have emerged in clusters around the country.

Among those 15 to 44 — the age group in which drug overdose accounts for the greatest share of deaths — there are vast differences across racial categories and between urban and rural places. Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.

The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.

“It just blew through all the measures we’d been taking,” said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn’t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there’s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene. The drug’s short half-life means that users have to inject more frequently, increasing the risk of transmitting H.I.V., hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases.

The illicit fentanyls being added to the heroin supply also vary widely in purity and quality. This unpredictability kills: Users often don’t realize the strength of what they’re taking until it’s too late.

An evolving epidemic

The country's struggles with opioids go back centuries, but the current epidemic has roots in the 1980s, when a few studies made doctors less wary of prescribing opioids for pain. Pharmaceutical manufacturers began aggressively marketing them for many ailments, particularly after OxyContin, a controlled-release opioid, hit the market in 1996. Soon, narcotics that had been reserved for cancer patients and end-of-life care found their way into medicine cabinets across the country.

Michael Botticelli, the executive director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at Boston Medical Center and former White House drug czar, said that rampant over-prescription of painkillers had actually been decreasing in the last few years. “We’d turned a corner on that,” Mr. Botticelli said, “but we’ve seen the continued escalation of overdose deaths in many states.”

Some experts argue that the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, undertaken when addiction treatment was insufficient, pushed people toward heroin and inadvertently drove up the rate of overdose deaths. Mr. Botticelli said that theory isn’t supported by the data.

Regardless of the cause, there is little disagreement that heroin addiction has evolved into a full-fledged crisis of its own. “Young people are flocking to heroin,” Dr. Ciccarone said. Halting prescription opioid abuse will probably not be enough to stop the growing number of deaths.

What can be done

The Trump administration has established a commission, led by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to study responses to the epidemic. The commission’s final report is expected in November.

Among public health researchers, there is broad agreement about what's needed: access to addiction treatment and medications; tighter regulation of prescription opioids; widespread distribution of naloxone, a fast-acting overdose antidote; needle exchanges or supervised injection centers; and law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, the bulk of which is thought to come from China and Mexico.

“This is not a hopeless situation,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., describing interdiction as a critical piece of the strategy. “If law enforcement can substantially interfere with the supply of illicit opioids, it will save a lot of lives.”

He and other experts expressed hope for new partnerships between law enforcement and public health. Cooperation would, for example, allow public health workers to pinpoint groups of drug users who may be amenable to treatment or identify particularly deadly batches of drugs before they kill.",You Draw It: Just How Bad Is the Drug Overdose Epidemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html

Mr. Weinstein’s social diagnosis successfully invoked the era that we had just memorialized after Hugh Hefner died. Mr. Hefner invented the Playboy ethos that Mr. Weinstein used like a get-out-of-jail-free card. “The culture then” encouraged men to loosen their libidos and women were expected to tolerate it. Playboy operated with a patina of civility that granted the average man a presumption of pleasure that went one way — his. And that permission flourished in the psyches of all kinds of men.

When Oliver Stone and Woody Allen came forward to express sympathy for Mr. Weinstein, everybody rolled their eyes at them, too. More defensive insult, and from men seemingly indifferent to an internet that swiftly dredged up trouble from their own sexual histories. That both directors felt a need to speak up illustrates an enduring, but misguided, myth of the sexual revolution. We romanticized Mr. Hefner’s empire as a revolutionary force — lovers gonna love, and all of that — but it was actually just a popularization of entitlement.

Photo

In the wake of the Weinstein news, as more women detail unwanted encounters with colleagues and bosses, we’re seeing how common it was for men, indeed, to help themselves. We’re seeing how the personal Playboy fantasy, benign as it might have looked, could spread into the workplace.

Mr. Hefner’s disdain for sexual limits fueled fantasies and shaped self-images. He was the Walt Disney of lust — and had his own set of seemingly innocuous iconic animal ears. You didn’t have to read Playboy, visit the mansion, wear pajamas or even be straight: The effects of its ideas about women on the American psyche were totalizing. Women were inferior to men because, for Playboy, they were scenery — pretty, passive, usually white, often blonde, there.

The Playboy doctrine would mutate into the darker, more explicit realm that is spooling out on “The Deuce.” Pornography gave us a framework for understanding sex as both an act and a state of mind that was similar to Hollywood’s imposition of ideas about romance.

The stories that get repeated in plot after plot have become a kind of erogenous pop-culture value system: women as prey, as parts (boobs, bottoms, lips, legs) as often as wholes; leading women but also the “final girl.” A search for full female humanity in Hollywood movies turns up a lot of dolls and dream girls.

The culture now seems eager to challenge some of those values — or at least to restage, unpack and reckon with, in Mr. Weinstein’s words, “the culture then.” The journalistic depiction of prostitution and a burgeoning porn cinema on “The Deuce” is grim and queasy and morally suspenseful. Not even the wiliest, most enterprising female characters fare well. But the show’s most exhilarating moments are on the faces of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dominique Fishback, as they come alive with plans of self-determination, of power-sharing. But it feels like it might take forever for their dreams to come true.

The other night I saw “Battle of the Sexes,” which recounts that time in 1974 when the former tennis champ and self-styled chauvinist clown Bobby Riggs baited Billie Jean King into playing a match that became a national political spectacle. It’s not a great movie. Things get logy anytime it goes near a hotel room. (Why don’t moviemakers know that hotel air isn’t quite the same as oxygen?)

But I went home happy, anyway. That’s because the movie takes a rollicking, triumphal approach to the feminism of its day. (It was also known as “women’s lib” back then.) The men sit around in locker rooms and lounges grinning and grunting and slurping beer. Howard Cosell says about Ms. King, “Should she ever let her hair grow down to her shoulders, took her glasses off, you’d have somebody vying for a Hollywood screen test.”

It’s true that no one is bragging about how easy it is to grab a woman by her vagina. And Riggs, courtesy of Steve Carell, is a cartoon: loud, bawdy, shameless, mildly pathetic, opportunistically insincere, a little desperate, a jester in misogynist drag. He’s like the villain in an episode of “Scooby Doo” before Scooby and the gang yank off his mask. I would’ve gotten away with it, if it weren’t for you meddling feminists!

And yet the old Riggs’s chauvinism is still out there. Earlier this month, Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers’ quarterback was asked by a sports reporter, Jourdan Rodrigue, a standard professional question about his receivers and their routes. He didn’t notice her professionalism. He noticed something else: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes.” (The lassitude in his response acquires some lasciviousness for that last word.)

This is to say that the Playboy-era myths are hard to shake. “Battle of the Sexes” and “The Deuce,” especially, show how resistant we are to real equality. One dead pimp on “The Deuce” doesn’t end male-controlled prostitution. Systemic inequity is harder to kill. So is the misogyny that fuels it.

The disentanglement of Harvey Weinstein from Hollywood’s institutions has, so far, culminated in the termination of his membership in the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit whose duties include handing out the Oscars. His eviction might address an aspect of the Harvey Weinstein problem. But it doesn’t do much to reverse the absence of women from all kinds of craft jobs; nor does it end the drought of best picture winners that feature two or more women in major speaking roles who also speak to each other. In the last 34 years, that’s happened twice, with “Terms of Endearment” and “Chicago.” We’re talking about a phallocentrism that’s baked into movies and television. It’s the reason we have the Bechdel Test, which asks whether female characters, among other very simple things, meaningfully communicate with each other about something other than a man. Almost no movies pass.

There’s power in turning to the past to illuminate the current state of things. But there’s different power in the culture now looking at the culture now — or now-ish. The second-season dismount of the Amazon show “One Mississippi” involves a woman’s reaction to an important, sexually creepy male producer. A sensationally complex episode of “Girls” from February — “American Bitch” — puts its protagonist, Hannah Horvath, inside the apartment and on the bed of a famous writer and notorious harasser whom she had visited in order to confront. The best thing about the HBO show “Westworld” is the struggle of female androids to extricate themselves from the limiting fantasies for which they’ve been created. And a major Emmy winner this year was HBO’s “Big Little Lies,” in which a group of frenemies wind up training their focus on an abusive husband. Another was “The Handmaid’s Tale,” on Hulu, about life for women under patriarchal totalitarianism. An idea associated with that show was the same as a hashtag that showed up during the women’s march in January: Resist.

Before this month, I had heard Beyoncé’s “Formation” as a song about, more or less, united, self-protective black feminism. But since the Weinstein news, the chorus sounds more than ever as if it could double as a gender-wide war command: “O.K., ladies now let’s get in formation” — or “let’s get information.” Either way, now I can hear a call for action and solidarity, to be seen and believed.

Still, the persistence of all this combat can leave you weary. That accounts for the mixed emotions of my night at “Battle of the Sexes.” This is a movie about a tennis match that really happened, yet it feels like a fable. When Billie Jean King, who’s played by Emma Stone, wins the first set, cheers broke out in the theater. Actual cheers. I turned around to see who clapped, and one section was filled with women who seemed old enough to remember seeing the match. Celebrating it felt good; it felt just.

It also felt dismayingly recurrent. The movie is called “Battle of the Sexes” but only because somebody already took “Groundhog Day.” And Ms. King is very much a civil rights legend. But, here, she’s also Sisyphus.

So what now? If the entitlements of the Playboy era have suffused our lunch breaks and boardroom meetings and subway rides home, and porn has evolved into something elemental, like fire and water, how do we prevent their personal encroachments and abuses, along with every other important but less salacious imbalance, like for instance, with salaries? How do we reconcile all the complications? “Resist” is one thing. “Change” is something else. Beyoncé is sending that solidarity cry out for ladies. But to get anything meaningful done, more than a few good men are going to have to answer it, too.","Weinstein, Hefner and the Poor Excuse That Explains a Lot",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/weinstein-hefner-and-the-poor-excuse-that-explains-a-lot.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

AKRON, Ohio — Drug overdose deaths in 2016 most likely exceeded 59,000, the largest annual jump ever recorded in the United States, according to preliminary data compiled by The New York Times.

The death count is the latest consequence of an escalating public health crisis: opioid addiction, now made more deadly by an influx of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and similar drugs. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50.

Although the data is preliminary, the Times’s best estimate is that deaths rose 19 percent over the 52,404 recorded in 2015. And all evidence suggests the problem has continued to worsen in 2017.

Drug overdose deaths, 1980 to 2016 *Estimate based on preliminary data

Because drug deaths take a long time to certify, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not be able to calculate final numbers until December. The Times compiled estimates for 2016 from hundreds of state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners. Together they represent data from states and counties that accounted for 76 percent of overdose deaths in 2015. They are a first look at the extent of the drug overdose epidemic last year, a detailed accounting of a modern plague.

The initial data points to large increases in drug overdose deaths in states along the East Coast, particularly Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Ohio, which filed a lawsuit last week accusing five drug companies of abetting the opioid epidemic, we estimate overdose deaths increased by more than 25 percent in 2016.

“Heroin is the devil’s drug, man. It is,” Cliff Parker said, sitting on a bench in Grace Park in Akron. Mr. Parker, 24, graduated from high school not too far from here, in nearby Copley, where he was a multisport athlete. In his senior year, he was a varsity wrestler and earned a scholarship to the University of Akron. Like his friends and teammates, he started using prescription painkillers at parties. It was fun, he said. By the time it stopped being fun, it was too late. Pills soon turned to heroin, and his life began slipping away from him.

Mr. Parker’s story is familiar in the Akron area. From a distance, it would be easy to paint Akron — “Rubber Capital of the World” — as a stereotypical example of Rust Belt decay. But that’s far from a complete picture. While manufacturing jobs have declined and the recovery from the 2008 recession has been slow, unemployment in Summit County, where Akron sits, is roughly in line with the United States as a whole. The Goodyear factories have been retooled into technology centers for research and polymer science. The city has begun to rebuild. But deaths from drug overdose here have skyrocketed.

In 2016, Summit County had 312 drug deaths, according to Gary Guenther, the county medical examiner’s chief investigator — a 46 percent increase from 2015 and more than triple the 99 cases that went through the medical examiner’s office just two years before. There were so many last year, Mr. Guenther said, that on three separate occasions the county had to request refrigerated trailers to store the bodies because they’d run out of space in the morgue.

It’s not unique to Akron. Coroners’ offices throughout the state are being overwhelmed.

In some Ohio counties, deaths from heroin have virtually disappeared. Instead, the culprit is fentanyl or one of its many analogues. In Montgomery County, home to Dayton, of the 100 drug overdose deaths recorded in January and February, only three people tested positive for heroin; 99 tested positive for fentanyl or an analogue.

Fentanyl isn’t new. But over the past three years, it has been popping up in drug seizures across the country.

Most of the time, it’s sold on the street as heroin, or drug traffickers use it to make cheap counterfeit prescription opioids. Fentanyls are showing up in cocaine as well, contributing to an increase in cocaine-related overdoses.

The most deadly of the fentanyl analogues is carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer 5,000 times stronger than heroin. An amount smaller than a few grains of salt can be a lethal dose.

“July 5th, 2016 — that’s the day carfentanil hit the streets of Akron,” said Capt. Michael Shearer, the commander of the Narcotics Unit for the Akron Police Department. On that day, 17 people overdosed and one person died in a span of nine hours. Over the next six months, the county medical examiner recorded 140 overdose deaths of people testing positive for carfentanil. Just three years earlier, there were fewer than a hundred drug overdose deaths of any kind for the entire year.

This exponential growth in overdose deaths in 2016 didn't extend to all parts of the country. In some states in the western half of the U.S., our data suggests deaths may have leveled off or even declined. According to Dr. Dan Ciccarone, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and an expert in heroin use in the United States, this geographic variation may reflect a historical divide in the nation’s heroin market between the powdered heroin generally found east of the Mississippi River and the Mexican black tar heroin found to the west.

This divide may have kept deaths down in the West for now, but according to Dr. Ciccarone, there is little evidence of differences in the severity of opioid addiction or heroin use. If drug traffickers begin to shift production and distribution in the West from black tar to powdered heroin in large quantities, fentanyl will most likely come along with it, and deaths will rise.

First responders are finding that, with fentanyl and carfentanil, the overdoses can be so severe that multiple doses of naloxone — the anti-overdose medication that often goes by the brand name Narcan — are needed to pull people out. In Warren County in Ohio, Doyle Burke, the chief investigator at the county coroner’s office, has been watching the number of drug deaths rise as the effectiveness of Narcan falls. “E.M.S. crews are hitting them with 12, 13, 14 hits of Narcan with no effect,” said Mr. Burke, likening a shot of Narcan to “a squirt gun in a house fire.”

Early data from 2017 suggests that drug overdose deaths will continue to rise this year. It’s the only aspect of American health, said Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C., that is getting significantly worse. Over two million Americans are estimated to be dependent on opioids, and an additional 95 million used prescription painkillers in the past year — more than used tobacco. “This epidemic, it’s got no face,” said Chris Eisele, the president of the Warren County Fire Chiefs’ Association and fire chief of Deerfield Township. The Narcotics Anonymous meetings here are populated by lawyers, accountants, young adults and teenagers who described comfortable middle-class upbringings.

Back in Akron, Mr. Parker has been clean for seven months, though he is still living on the streets. The ground of the park is littered with discarded needles, and many among the homeless here are current or former heroin users. Like most recovering from addiction, Mr. Parker needed several tries to get clean — six, by his count. The severity of opioid withdrawal means users rarely get clean unless they are determined and have treatment readily available. “No one wants their family to find them face down with a needle in their arm,” Mr. Parker said. “But no one stops until they’re ready.”

About the data

Our count of drug overdoses for 2016 is an estimate. A precise number of drug overdose deaths will not be available until December.

As the chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch of the National Center for Health Statistics at the C.D.C., Robert Anderson oversees the collection and codification of the nation’s mortality data. He noted that toxicology results, which are necessary to assign a cause of death, can take three to six months or longer. “It’s frustrating, because we really do want to track this stuff,” he said, describing how timely data on cause of death would let public health workers allocate resources in the right places.

To come up with our count, we contacted state health departments in all 50 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, asking for their statistics on drug overdose deaths among residents. In states that didn't have numbers available, we turned to county medical examiners and coroners’ offices. In some cases, partial results were extrapolated through the end of the year to get estimates for 2016.

While noting the difficulty of making predictions, Mr. Anderson reviewed The Times’s estimates and said they seemed reasonable. The overdose death rate reported by the N.C.H.S. provisional estimates for the first half of 2016 would imply a total of 59,779 overdose deaths, if the death rate remains flat through the second half of the year. Based on our reporting, we believe this rate increased.

While the process in each state varies slightly, death certificates are usually first filled out by a coroner, medical examiner or attending physician. These death certificates are then collected by state health departments and sent to the N.C.H.S., which assigns what’s called an ICD-10 code to each death. This code specifies the underlying cause of death, and it’s what determines whether a death is classified as a drug overdose.

Sometimes, the cases are straightforward; other times, it’s not so easy. The people in charge of coding each death — called nosologists — have to differentiate between deaths due to drug overdose and those due to the long-term effects of drug abuse, which get a different code. (There were 2,573 such deaths in 2015.) When alcohol and drugs are both present, they must specify which of the two was the underlying cause. If it’s alcohol, it’s not a “drug overdose” under the commonly used definition. Ideally, every medical examiner, coroner and attending physician would fill out death certificates with perfect consistency, but there are often variations from jurisdiction to jurisdiction that can introduce inconsistencies to the data.

These inconsistencies are part of the reason there is a delay in drug death reporting, and among the reasons we can still only estimate the number of drug overdoses in 2016. Since we compiled our data from state health departments and county coroners and medical examiners directly, the deaths have not yet been assigned ICD-10 codes by the N.C.H.S. — that is, the official underlying cause of death has not yet been categorized. In addition, the mortality data in official statistics focuses on deaths among residents. But county coroners typically count up whichever deaths come through their office, regardless of residency. When there were large discrepancies between the 2015 counts from the C.D.C. and the state or county, we used the percent change from 2015 to calculate our 2016 estimate.

We can say with confidence that drug deaths rose a great deal in 2016, but it is hard to say precisely how many died or in which places drug deaths rose most steeply. Because of the delay associated with toxicology reports and inconsistencies in the reported data, our exact estimate — 62,497 total drug overdose deaths — could vary from the true number by several thousand.",Drug Deaths in America Are Rising Faster Than Ever,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/05/upshot/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-deaths-are-rising-faster-than-ever.html

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

My first exposure to rock ’n’ roll came from watching mostly white bands like Nirvana, Korn and Limp Bizkit perform angsty songs on MTV. I bought some of their albums, but the genre didn’t really resonate with me until I learned that black people could be rock ’n’ roll artists too. None had as great an influence on me as Fats Domino, one of the biggest stars of the early rock ’n’ roll era, who died on Tuesday in Harvey, La.



I was raised in a musical household in New Orleans. I played the drums and piano as a child, and my dad played bass. He and his bandmates encouraged me to study the history of rock ’n’ roll, not dismiss it. In one of my weekly runs to Blockbuster’s used CDs section, I found a Led Zeppelin CD, which eventually led me to Jimi Hendrix. He was the first black person I learned about who played rock ’n’ roll — a term I thought was fixed but whose meaning kept expanding.

Around then, I began to play gigs with bands that would occasionally cover Mr. Hendrix’s songs, and it was powerful to watch the audience react. I wanted to be able to tap into that kind of energy too, but also to balance it with something else I couldn’t quite identify yet.

Around 1998, when I was 12 years old, I sat in on one of my father’s gigs and first heard “Blueberry Hill” by Fats Domino. The song seemed deeply familiar; it was almost as if it was otherworldly, floating somewhere in the ether. I had never heard such a percussive piano section. Folks of various ages and races got up to dance and sing along in a joyous communal outburst.

But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read “Stronger Than Lions.”

When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: “Probably, or a Republican. I’m registered as an independent.

Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump’s election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, “Wow, if that dude can do it…,” and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls “headline porn,” or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?

The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as “Trump without the crazy.” He calls Trump batty but has also written that it’s good to have “the edge,” when “people think you’re crazy and they are right, but you don’t care what they think.”

He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. “I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up,” he says. “When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn’t take much space and they’re expensive.”

He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire — a moment recreated by Cuban’s mentally unhinged doppelgänger on HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Russ Hanneman.

“Look, there are people who are saying we don’t need another business person,” he says, sipping iced tea. “But it’s about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I’d want to come in with proof of an agenda, ‘Here’s a health care solution and I’ve already paid my own money to have it scored.’

“They always say that people vote against what they didn’t like about the previous president, right? And I think he’s so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who’s not a politician. If that’s a celebrity, that’s just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?”

He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I’m going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I’m going to need a commitment from you that you’re going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.

“If you did that,” he says, “you’d be a hero.”

Asked if he would send the Mavericks’ former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, “Why not?”

Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.

But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks’ point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on “Shark Tank,” Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.

He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: “I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves.”

In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, “If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it’s late at night, I’m walking to the other side of the street,” and if he sees a white guy who “has tattoos all over his face,” he’d do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.

But Cuban can empathize with Trump. “If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that’s Donald Trump,” Cuban says. “He’s overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where’s the list of entrepreneurs who say, ‘He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me’?”

I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a “neurotic dope” and Cuban an “arrogant, crude, dope” who is “not smart enough to run for president.”

“There are three Donald Trumps,” he says. “Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll.” Trump’s Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy “screaming at a sporting event.” (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)

Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary’s running mate or Trump’s. “I wasn’t a Hillary fan, by the way,” he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.

Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?

“They didn’t see it coming at all,” he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. “I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I’m like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.

“In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement.”

He scoffs: “The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn’t collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?”

Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from “The Apprentice” with Trump’s sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn’t have such a tape.

His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. “Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him,” Cuban says. “And I sent him an email back saying, ‘At some point, you have to learn the issues.’ Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?” He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.

Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. “If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours,” he says, “they’re going to kick our ass.”

Cuban always says he’s lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good.” He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a “smart, funny and beautiful” and “a badass.” His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in “Big.” “We’ve got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom,” he says.

He did well, I say, with his samba to the “I Dream of Jeannie” theme on “Dancing With the Stars,” especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.

“I told my wife,” he says, “I don’t want to look back and say I would’ve, could’ve, should’ve.”

Maybe that’s what Cuban is thinking about 2020.",Mark Cuban’s Not Done Trolling Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/mark-cubans-not-done-trolling-donald-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Unlike, say, fine art or coins, the growth in sports memorabilia collecting has been a function of a collision of demographics, economics and technology. For decades, players routinely gave away their autographs and their gear, including balls, bats and jerseys. Babe Ruth, baseball’s biggest titan, signed his name for almost anyone who asked. Trading cards were mostly collected by children, though starting in the 1930s, visionaries like Jefferson Burdick created a cataloging system that became the foundation of the industry years later.

It wasn’t until the go-go years of the 1980s, when the first baby boomers were reaching middle age, that large amounts of money poured into the sports memorabilia market, especially for baseball-related items, which make up about 70 percent of the vintage market. The value of trading cards for the most famous players including Mickey Mantle and Hank Aaron jumped. So did autographs and signed photographs. Serious collectors began paying five-, six- and even seven-figure sums for scarce items, like jerseys worn by Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and others, and ballplayers like Pete Rose were paid thousands of dollars to appear at autograph signings.

But like any unregulated market, the risk of fraud was ever-present. To the unsuspecting buyer, an autograph could be forged and an ordinary ball substituted for a rare one. And the internet, which helped match buyers with sellers, was also used to pawn off fakes.

So in time, insurers started writing policies that covered sports memorabilia and authenticators began to verify the legitimacy of cards and other items. Sports leagues, sensing a chance to enhance interest in their games, have also been authenticating game-used bats, balls, jerseys and other items. And while authenticators have not been above reproach, their entry into the market has generally reassured buyers.

“Any industry where authentication has been introduced, the market has flourished, whether it’s baseball cards, comic books or game worn jerseys,” said Troy Kinunen, who is in charge of consignments, sales and purchases at Mears Online Auctions in South Milwaukee. “Authentication created consumer confidence and consumer confidence create higher prices.”

Higher prices, he added, have also attracted thieves, the ultimate backhanded compliment. In recent years, a rash of sports museums have been pilfered, with thieves getting away with Yogi Berra’s World Series rings, Roger Maris’s most valuable player plaque from 1960, the 1903 Belmont Stakes trophy, and a replica of an alligator-skin belt with a solid gold buckle given to the golfer Ben Hogan. None of the items have been recovered.

Perhaps the most brazen theft occurred this year, when a journalist and memorabilia collector from Mexico stole the jersey worn by Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, out of his locker soon after the Patriots Super Bowl victory. After an investigation spanning two countries, the jersey — which some experts said was worth about half a million dollars — was recovered about a month later.

“People are realizing the value and demand of it,” said James Spence, the founder of JSA, a company that verifies the legitimacy of sports memorabilia.

The demand, it seems, is insatiable, at least for the most coveted items, the values of which have risen so reliably in the past several decades that some people are investing in sports memorabilia to diversify their portfolios, according to Chris Ivy, the director of sports collectibles at Heritage Auctions in Dallas who is currently selling the only known jersey worn by Jackie Robinson in 1947, his rookie season. (The auction will last until mid-November.)

“There’s only so much you can put in real estate and Wall Street,” said Mr. Ivy, whose company handles about $60 million in auction sales annually. “Collectibles in general are seeing a lot of growth and sports is seeing most of that.”

But for every investor looking to make a buck, there are hundreds if not thousands more who collect because they love a sport, team or player. The great thing about sports compared to, say, stamps, which younger people rarely use now, is there is always another generation of fans who turn into collectors.

“I see it like art, something we grow up with and at the end of the day, evokes passion in us,” Mr. Ivy said. “Anything that does that will hold a special place.”","Trading Sports Memorabilia, Not Just for Love but for Money",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/sports-memorabilia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

He said the administration would produce “really big, really great advertising” aimed at young people because, “If we can teach young people not to take drugs, it’s really, really easy not to take them.” This is sloganeering reminiscent of the ineffective, Reagan-era “Just Say No” programs, when the ravages of drug abuse in black and Hispanic communities were treated with harsh punishment, rather than the empathy and care that is being called for today.

Deaths from opioid overdoses have more than tripled since 2002. As of 2015, an estimated two million Americans were addicted to prescription opioids, and nearly 600,000 to heroin. Opioid addiction rose most swiftly among white, middle-class Americans, though it now spares no state, race or income group. Efforts to treat the disease have nearly bankrupted people whose insurance falls short. Financial constraints often prevent uninsured people from seeking treatment at all.

At least Mr. Trump said on Thursday that the administration planned to roll back a rule preventing Medicaid funding from being used for treatment in large inpatient addiction facilities, a recommendation made by the opioids commission in late July.

But it is still not clear who will lead the response to the epidemic, since Mr. Trump has yet to appoint a number of officials who could do so. He was forced to withdraw his nominee to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Representative Tom Marino, Republican of Pennsylvania, after news emerged that Mr. Marino had helped drug wholesalers make it harder for the Drug Enforcement Administration to crack down on black-market opioid distribution. Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s former health and human services secretary, lost his job because of his use of private jets.

The opioids commission’s final recommendations are scheduled to be released on Wednesday, but the administration has yet to act on most of the commission’s interim recommendations. “I still have not seen the passion for this epidemic that I saw in the AIDS epidemic,” Gov. Chris Christie, the commission’s chairman, said recently.

There are some in the administration who do seem to get it: In a hearing this week, Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, advocated expanding the use of medication-assisted treatments, such as methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone, citing evidence that they are effective in reducing overdose deaths.

One would have hoped that Mr. Trump would be eager to deliver real relief for an epidemic that affects millions of American families.

THE GROWN-UPS’ Table

By Gabrielle Hamilton

For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.

I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.

Setting The Table In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”

Enjoy your meal.

To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.

I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.

Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.

But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.

And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.

Questlove 1/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him. What food would you serve? I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created. Where would you host it? I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in. What would you be drinking? Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out. What sort of music would you play? Sixties music from Detroit. How would you get people to leave? They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house. Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018. Alice Waters 2/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate. What food would you serve? Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine. Where would you host it? At home. What would you be drinking? Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner. What sort of music would you play? Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room. How would you get people to leave? I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye. Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse. Busy Philipps 3/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Jason Greene, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz. What food would you serve? A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do. Where would you host it? At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown. What would you be drinking? Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink. What sort of music would you play? Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music. How would you get people to leave? I just go to bed. People get the hint. Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO. DJ Khaled 4/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite. What food would you serve? Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant. Where would you host it? My home. What would you be drinking? Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine. What sort of music would you play? Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé. How would you get people to leave? I would just keep bringing dessert out. DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June. John Waters 5/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served! What food would you serve? Liver. Shut up and eat it. Where would you host it? In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd. What would you be drinking? Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A. What sort of music would you play? King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould. How would you get people to leave? Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.” The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.

I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.

But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their pensione. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.

And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.

But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.

Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.

Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.

Her mother then severely neglected her six children, forcing Doralinda to quit school after the sixth grade to clean houses so that her brothers could keep studying. Often, all she could feed them were tortillas with salt, which Doralinda cooked over firewood she collected in the forest.

When she was 14, her mother sent her to wash clothes for a man she knew from church. When Doralinda entered his home, he chained the door shut. As Doralinda screamed for help, the man, twice her size, threw her on the bed, ripped off her clothes and raped her. Then he brandished a gun. “Don’t kill me,” she pleaded. If she told anyone, the man warned, he would hunt her down wherever she was, rape her again, and kill her and her brothers.

The girl’s grandmother insisted on taking her to the nearest police station to report the crime. The rapist, whom Doralinda soon learned was part of a drug-trafficking family, told Doralinda’s mother to withdraw the report or he would exterminate everyone in her family.

“I was very scared,” Doralinda said. She fled; each time she felt someone was watching her, she moved again, first elsewhere in Guatemala, then three more times in Mexico. She battled nightmares: Her rapist was shooting, drowning, stabbing her, lurking under her bed. She became suicidal. She was living with her aunt’s family in Hermosillo, Mexico, when five men surrounded her cousin’s husband and stabbed him in the heart. Was the hit ordered by her rapist? This time she ran to the United States. “I came because I lived in fear of being killed,” she said.

Now Doralinda’s fate is tied to her cousin’s. The president is pitting Dreamers, one group of vulnerable children brought here by their parents, against perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, those who arrive here alone. Most of this population — around 60,000 young people, apprehended in fiscal year 2016 — are children fleeing horrific gang and drug cartel violence in one of the most dangerous places on earth, in Central America, and who often make terrifying, sometimes lethal, journeys to beg for safety at our border.

The move has rightly set child advocates’ hair on fire. “We are going to trade little children fleeing violence for older children who have lived their whole lives in America. It’s disgusting,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

The United States is in the throes of a great debate: Do we want — can we afford — to remain a safe haven for people who, unlike economic migrants, come here running for their lives? This year the administration slashed the number of refugees the United States will allow by more than half.

We are at risk of becoming a country that turns its back on the most vulnerable: children from neighboring countries who show up at our border with no parents and no place to turn. And yet, in a response to a renewed uptick in the number of these children arriving at our border, that’s who we are turning our backs on first.

Lesli is desperate to not lose the temporary legal status she received when she applied four years ago for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It changed everything. She no longer had to live in fear of being stopped by police or ICE agents in her hometown, Loganville, Ga. She could drive. Working as an elementary school teaching aide, she managed to save enough to start a year at Kennesaw State University, even though Dreamers in Georgia must pay out-of-state tuition, which can be more than twice as much as in-state tuition. Stressing that her father worked 14-hour days picking tobacco so that she wouldn’t have to, she says, “I won’t let anything stop me.”

Still, she refuses to believe that Doralinda — who crawls into bed with Lesli when she wakes herself up screaming with nightmares — must be harmed by this country’s policies if Lesli is to be helped, that one woman could be happy and the other could be left fighting for her life.

“A country like ours should say: We value your life, we value you as a human. We are going to help you,” she told me.

Instead, the opposite is happening. An administration that came to power fueled by anti-immigrant fervor has increased arrests of immigrants who are in the country illegally by 43 percent. Just in the past few days, a 10-year-old girl — certainly not one of the “bad hombres” Mr. Trump once spoke of — was detained after undergoing emergency surgery.

In September, the administration said it was ending DACA, which had allowed Lesli and nearly 800,000 others brought unlawfully to the United States as children by their parents to temporarily legalize. Now their target is children who migrate alone and are seeking safety — boys are often fleeing forced gang recruitment; girls are escaping the clutches of gangsters who force them to be their girlfriend.

The Trump administration is doing away with protections for these children on multiple fronts.

The president has proposed that Congress scrap a 1997 legal settlement that requires these children be detained in the least restrictive setting and quickly released to a parent or guardian. He would no longer allow children to go to more child-sensitive asylum officers, and they would instead face adversarial immigration court hearings. He wants to severely restrict visas for children who can show they have been neglected or abused by a parent — a remedy that has been the most successful path to legalize these children.

Perhaps most important, he has called on Congress to undo a 2008 law requiring that instead of being quickly deported, children who aren’t Mexican or Canadian are allowed into the United States and spend about a month in child-friendly detention shelters or foster care homes as authorities vet a parent or guardian the child can be released to while they wait for their case to go to court.

Instead, the president would have a border patrol agent decide whether a child faces danger if turned away. The problem: Studies show that border patrol agents, who have always been asked to play this role with Mexican unaccompanied children, have failed to identify hardly any children at risk. A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that border patrol agents returned 95 percent of Mexican children, even when there were signs some had been trafficked.

In August, the administration partially canceled a program that allowed children deemed in immediate danger in Central America to apply for a chance to travel legally to the United States. Some 2,700 children who had been approved were left stranded. In September, the administration announced an additional phasing out of a refugee program for these children.

The administration has sought to discourage the flow of children arriving at the border by asking the ones who do show up to provide the address and name of their parents — and then using the information to go after the parents and deport them.

In the midst of all of this, the administration is also trying to redefine who should be considered unaccompanied. In a radical reinterpretation of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, a September memo by the Executive Office for Immigration Review told judges they had the right to strip away the protections if a minor turned 18 during court proceedings that can drag on for years or was reunified with a parent in the United States. Child advocates fear the next step — the administration’s ultimate intent — is to begin expedited removal of children, says Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, a group that recruits lawyers to represent unaccompanied migrant youth pro bono. (I am on the board of that organization.)

To be clear, it is, at this moment, legal to present yourself at our border and ask for safety. Our government has not lost all decency: We still treat innocent children with some kindness. We demand border patrol not lock them up for more than 72 hours in jail cells, transfer them to child-friendly detention shelters and let them make their case to a judge that they qualify to stay here legally. But we must do more: Six in 10 unaccompanied children — some are toddlers — are standing in immigration court alone, with no legal representation to help them make their case for asylum. I watched a 7-year-old stand before a judge, shaking like a leaf, because anything he said could send him hurtling back to the danger he just fled.

Dreamers, despite having the most to lose, have been most adamant in rejecting Trump’s proposals. “It’s a white nationalist racist wish list,” says Cristina Jiménez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream.","To Help a Dreamer, Why Do We Have to Hurt Her Cousin?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/opinion/sunday/dreamers-children-immigration-congress.html

Helsinki’s Best Public Saunas: A Guide

Finnish culture revolves around the sauna. Historically, saunas were where Finns brewed their beer, washed their laundry and cured their hams; where babies were born, the sick were healed and the dead were prepared for burial.

Today, Finland has more than three million saunas for its 5.5 million people — and the sauna is where all serious conversations about work, sex, relationships, politics and faith take place. “Finnish people are bit shy in general, but somehow open up at a sauna when surrounded by strangers,” says Tanja Aromaki, general manager of the Lonna spa, which runs during the summer on Lonna Island, just off the Helsinki mainland.

As the cold months draw near, here are some of the capital’s best public options for stripping down and sweating like a local.

Sauna Arla

As Finnish people moved from rural forested areas into the city during the industrialization of the 1920s and 1930s, few apartments had hot water or showers, so people bathed at public saunas. Although this trend has reversed — almost every building now has its own sauna facilities — there are a handful of public saunas from the era still operating, and gas-and-wood-fired Sauna Arla , established in 1929 and offering massage, cupping and backwashing, is one of the city’s most iconic.

“In the sauna there is strange peace in its darkness and warmness,” says the spot’s owner-manager, Kimmo Helisto. “You don’t need to talk too much — you can face yourself and think about your own things.”

Kaurilan Sauna

Another of Helsinki’s wood-stove saunas, Kaurilan , operates in a 19th-century log cabin. It was originally located in nearby Tuusula but was moved to the leafy Old Meilahti neighborhood in 1995. Its owner, Saara Lehtonen, who makes her own sauna linens and organic cosmetics in an adjacent workshop, says she has seen a recent uptick in Finns seeking the social and spiritual aspect of the shared sauna experience. “Public saunas have always been a place where your status has no meaning and everyone is welcome to relax and enjoy the beautiful, unique and sacred atmosphere a sauna can offer,” she says.

Loyly

“Key things for a good sauna are that it’s wood heated, it has a big enough stove and it has enough fresh air,” says Eemeli Nurminen, general manager of the sleek, architecturally striking Loyly , named for the untranslatable Finnish word which encapsulates the sound, heat and moisture of splashing water on a hot stove. Owned by the Finnish TV star Jasper Paakkonen and member of parliament Antero Vartia, it offers coed steam and smoke saunas heated by 7,000-kg stoves. Since it opened in May 2016, it has become a popular day-into-night hangout — you’ll often spot Finnish notables at the bar and on the breezy terrace.

Finnish Sauna Society

The Finnish Sauna Society was established in 1937 to foster the heritage and health benefits of the national bath. Today, its oceanfront clubhouse offers six wood-fired saunas and four savusaunas (smoke saunas) for its 4,200 members and their guests, plus personal washing and massage services. The society awards grants to members keen to undertake sauna-related studies and its regular seminars are a great introduction to sauna culture — including lessons on the mythology surrounding sauna elves, gnomes and trolls who enjoy the last of the steam once the humans have gone.

Sauna Hermanni

Located in its eponymous neighborhood, Sauna Hermanni opened to serve the surrounding apartments in 1953. Its owner, Mika Ahonen, strives to maintain the aesthetic of that time — there are retro wood-paneled sauna walls and locker rooms displaying contemporary photos and magazines and hosting regular D.J. nights, poetry readings and barbecues. Pass by and you’ll find visitors of all ages cooling off outside with a lemonade and a herring sandwich, even in the dead of winter. “Most people comes after work or study and stay two to three hours,” Ahonen says. “They can hang around as long they want; we don’t have time limits.”

Kotiharjun Sauna

Serving patrons since 1928, the family-owned Kotiharjun is one of Helsinki’s longest-running public saunas and one of its most relaxed. There’s no need to book a spot — and you can stay as long as you like. You can also buy your own vihtu (birch switch) with which to whack yourself — it’s supposed to improve circulation — or indulge in a washing experience with massage, reflexology and acupressure. Between steam sessions, saunagoers grab a towel and beer and chill — literally — on the street outside.

Uunisaari

Tiny beach-ringed Uunisaari Island, a two-minute ferry ride from Helsinki pier, has a nostalgia-tinged, Old World holiday feel that speaks to its long history as an urban escape. “Even in the 19th century, Uunisaari had a famous seaside bathhouse,” says its head of operations, Outi Gummerus. While red-brick Restaurant Ugn and the island’s barbecue spots and beaches are open to the public year-round, its two upscale wood-shack saunas and outdoor whirlpool are only for exclusive use, except on Sundays, when you can purchase a public ticket and relax on the terrace between sessions with harbor views, cocktails and live music.

Kulttuurisauna

Established in 2013 by the designer Nene Tsuboi and the architect Tuomas Toivonen to enhance the city’s public bath options, this wood-heated sauna takes its stylistic cues from the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who was also a sauna fan. Quite a few rules are upheld to retain the sauna’s sense of sanctuary: no reservations, no private parties, no groups, no alcoholic drinks and no swimwear — Finns don’t want swimming-pool chlorine vaporizing in the heat — although you’re welcome to don a suit when mingling on the harborfacing coed deck.

Saunas at Yrjonkatu Swimming Hall

When it opened in 1928, Yrjonkatu was Finland’s only public swimming hall — and remained so for several decades. Now, the grand building — reopened following an extensive two-year renovation in 1999 — speaks to the classic architecture of the time. In addition to a 25-meter lap pool, Yrjonkatu offers multiple electric wood-heated public and private, single gender and coed saunas over several floors. 011-358-9-310-87401",Helsinki’s Best Public Saunas: A Guide,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/t-magazine/travel/helsinki-best-public-saunas.html

A couple of years ago, Mr. Smithwick’s adviser, Jakob Vinther, went to China and took high resolution images of Sinosauropteryx specimens under specially polarized light, which brought out their colors.

The dark feathers — the only ones that were preserved on the fossils — were filled with melanin, the same pigment that colors our hair and skin. It is a strong molecule that is resistant to decay and can survive in fossils for hundreds of millions of years.

Mr. Smithwick mapped the pigmented feathers on the fossils, finding that the Sinosauropteryx had brownish feathers covering its back and sides that stopped about halfway down its body. The rest of the feathers were most likely lightly colored.

The color pattern is a form of camouflage known as “countershading,” and on the Sinosauropteryx the transition from dark to light happened relatively high on the body. Mr. Smithwick said that the pattern could provide insight into the type of environment where the dinosaur lived.

He made 3D models of the dinosaur’s color shading and tested them under different types of light to see where they would perform best as camouflage. He found that the pattern was most useful in open environments where sunlight is coming straight from above with little interference.

When sunlight illuminates an animal’s top, it also keeps its underside in shadow, he said. This means that when something is looking at it, whether a predator or prey, the animal is seen as a three-dimensional object.

More Reporting on Paleontology

But countershading distorts the shadows in a way that makes the animal look less three-dimensional, and harder to spot. Animals that live in open, grassy environments have sharp transitions high on their body, from dark to light. But those that live in wooded or forested areas, like deer, tend to have a more gradual transition that appears much lower on the body.

The research suggests that countershading is not a modern evolutionary development, but a timeless camouflage technique.

Mr. Smithwick added that the dark feathers around the eyes indicate that Sinosauropteryx had “bandit masks,” most famously seen in raccoons, but also in some badgers, ferrets and red pandas.

Researchers tend to think mammals use the patches as warning signs that tell predators they are aggressive and not to be messed with. But Mr. Smithwick thinks Sinosauropteryx used its eye patches either as camouflage or to block glare, like athletes who paint dark stripes under their eyes to reduce incoming sunlight.

Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved in the study, said the research was a leap forward in paleontologists’ understanding of Sinosauropteryx.

“We knew before that its feathers were vibrantly patterned, but this study shows that it was countershaded and even striped,” Dr. Brusatte said in an email. “These findings breathe life into this dinosaur.”",A Turkey-Sized Dinosaur With a Raccoon-Like Bandit Mask,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/science/dinosaur-raccoon-bandit-mask.html

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.",Lupita Nyong’o: Speaking Out About Harvey Weinstein,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/opinion/lupita-nyongo-harvey-weinstein.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case.
In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota.
Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students.","And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers.

Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group.

The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was “time to pause” on the issue.

The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers.

Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them.

Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers’ union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son’s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex.

“I was willing to do everything and anything,” Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case.

The mothers’ resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons’ accusers had felt hurt.

Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction.

One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent.

“In my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,” Judith said. “It was considered, ‘I was stupid and I got embarrassed.’”

Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, “preponderance of the evidence,” in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation.

The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. “We recognized that power,” Ms. Seefeld said.

Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way.

A number of women’s groups and victims’ advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as “rape deniers” and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them.

Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson.

“It is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,” Ms. Davidson said.

But, she said of the mothers, “I think it’s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.”

Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons’ names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up.

Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center.

Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before.

“I think I have a problem,” her son said. “It’s bad.”

She felt a flash of irritation.

“How many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,” she said she told him.

Then the gravity of the situation sank in. “I need to hire a lawyer,” she thought.

A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus.

As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son’s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it “as if it were the grocery list,” she recalled.

Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules.

According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done.

Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said.

Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online.

Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. “It was very solemn,” Alison said. “It was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.”

Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal.

She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women’s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were “super respectful” of women, she said.

“We don’t really need to teach our sons not to rape,” she said.

Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a “double life,” unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown.

Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students — to a point.

“Any mother is watching out for the children, that’s what mothers do,” Ms. Davidson said. “But I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.”

Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years.

His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators.

Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son’s case, she said. “Within 30 minutes I heard from the president,” she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed.

A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser’s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.)

Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will?

“I just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,” she said of her son’s punishment. “And pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.”","‘Willing to Do Everything,’ Mothers Defend Sons Accused of Sexual Assault",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/campus-sex-assault-mothers.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

To walk through Midland Beach is to hear the chugging and whining of backhoes and power tools and the pounding of hammers as contractors rebuild.

But relatives of those who died described gaps in their own reckoning with loss. Some remain haunted by what they imagine about the end. Others still feel an uncomfortable frustration toward their loved one who died — why didn’t he evacuate? Or why did she wait until the last moment?

Walter Colborne, the 89-year-old father, and his wife, Marie Colborne, 66, were active retirees in the Great Kills neighborhood, traveling on cruise ships and taking regular outings in their yacht they kept at a dock near their home. Mrs. Colborne, like her husband, had been married before, and with that in mind, they named the yacht “One More Time.” They once spent a month navigating the Atlantic to visit children in Florida, and another month coming home.

Mr. Colborne was a World War II veteran who had fought in Europe. He was fearless, said his daughter, Christine Colborne, 64, of Fort Myers, Fla. Their children were concerned, but not surprised, when the couple said they were riding out Sandy in their apartment.

“I told her to get the hell out,” said Mrs. Colborne’s daughter from a prior marriage, Jeanne Mikkelsen, 52, also of Fort Myers. “She said, ‘No, we’re staying upstairs.’ Well, they didn’t stay upstairs.’”

The storm arrived on Oct. 29, 2012. The Colbornes’ children called and called. No answer. Mr. Colborne’s granddaughter, Debra Drancsak Cooper, 54, urged others to stay calm. “I said, ‘Mom, they had a hurricane. The cells are down.” She is from Gretna, La., and like her aunts in Florida, knew what a passing storm could do to communications. But then another day passed.

“Halloween night is when we really started thinking about it,” Ms. Cooper said.

The police, firefighters and paramedics searched on Staten Island for survivors. But it was a civilian who, looking behind a boat in a wooded lot, found the two bodies.

“We think they probably panicked in the end,” said Christine Colborne. “There was water and sand in their condo. They panicked and tried to go.”

Even that still doesn’t sound quite right; Mr. Colborne wasn’t prone to panic. Their children wonder if he had some sort of medical emergency that forced them to seek help. Their car was near the bodies, keys in the ignition and a few thousand dollars and some clothes stashed inside.

“We still want to think in our minds that they were together, holding hands,” Ms. Cooper said. “Which they were not.”

At their funeral, another couple said they had seen the Colbornes drive away from the apartment as they were doing the same thing, but they turned in different directions when exiting the complex, one couple toward safety and the other, death.

“I obsessed over my father in this cold black water, wondering what his final thoughts were,” said Christine Colborne. “It killed me.”

A few miles away, a 79-year-old widow and mother of six, Beatrice Spagnuolo, was in her small home on Grimsby Street in Midland Beach as the storm approached. She had survived colon cancer, but she was frail. Her next-door neighbor was her best friend, practically family.

When she was raising her children, Ms. Spagnuolo had preached the importance of solid civil-service jobs, and they listened. She would come to count among them a police officer, a subway motorman, a construction foreman and a sanitation worker.

One of her daughters, a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, was asleep on her couch as the storm approached. Ms. Spagnuolo’s house was on her regular route.

Her son Vincent called. “I said, ‘You’ve got to get the hell out of there — get your stuff and go,’” he said. “The water was coming up to her knees.”

She obeyed. Her daughter helped her into their car and was pulling away from the house. Then the mother told her to stop.

“Let me go get my pills,” she told her daughter. She went back inside.

A huge wave struck the block. “All the lights went black,” Mr. Spagnuolo said, repeating what his sister later told the family. “There were wires from the telephone pole, electrocuting. Sparks.”

When the waters receded, Ms. Spagnuolo’s body was found in the house. Next door, her old friend, Anastasia Rispoli, 73, was dead, too.

Halloween was the next day. Mr. Spagnuolo, who lived in Brooklyn, had a young daughter who had expected to go trick-or-treating. “She was crying,” Mr. Spagnuolo recalled. “So I took her around the corner. I had to put on a happy attitude for her. It was terrible.”

The death of Ms. Spagnuolo affected her children in different ways. Some have become more reclusive, skipping family gatherings at Christmas and other holidays. Most of them, like Mr. Spagnuolo, cannot visit the block of Grimsby where she lived. He lights a candle at Mass for his mother, who was a regular at church.

“You relive it,” he said. “Every year they have, like, a walk down by the beach there. They play a bagpiper. It’s tough to go. Something you don’t get over, the way she died.”

The house, unsafe, was razed. The lot remains empty. Someone else delivers mail on the block — not Ms. Spagnuolo’s daughter, who, like her brother in sanitation, can’t go back. Not for work, not for anything.

In the case of the Colbornes, it was Mrs. Colborne’s daughter, Ms. Mikkelsen, who settled their affairs on Staten Island, where she grew up and couldn’t get away from fast enough after college. But a string of fluke accidents — a bad pipe, a neighbor’s leak — has delayed the sale of their home and kept her reluctantly coming back up from Florida for weeks at a time.

“It’s almost like somebody up above doesn’t want me to move on,” she said.

Finally, this summer brought interest from a buyer.

“I went in, I said goodbye to the apartment, and I don’t ever plan on going back there again,” she said. “Staten Island represents the death of my mother.”

In her darkest times, she forced herself to think about other victims. A mother lost two sons, ages 2 and 4, when waves swept them from her arms on Staten Island. That mother, like others, declined to speak last week. Ms. Mikkelsen has never met her.

The popularity of their food at the market prompted the two chefs to start searching for a more permanent home for their business. Federal lucked out.

The cafe’s wooden-slatted building is surrounded by weathered seating, as well as raised garden beds with wild overgrown herbs, tomatoes, and tiny pansies that decorate the desserts sold inside. Chickens wander among the tables with entitled beady stares, begging for scraps. Inside, up some ramshackle steps, a line of customers forms early at lunchtime to order at the counter and take a number. If they get there after noon they’ll spend some time outside hovering until one of the tables or benches is vacated. (A park across the street provides some needed extra seating.)

Sushi is available at lunch as prepackaged rolls to go, daily specials listed on a blackboard and freshly made hand rolls. The most economical tactic is to order one or two of the rolls from the short menu beside the cash register, but you’ll miss out on the gorgeous salads that accompany the special roll of the day.

The salads here might be punctuated with pink peppercorns, or pepitas, or thin threads that resemble saffron but are actually dehydrated red peppers of varying degrees of spiciness. Tasmanian sea trout sashimi comes fanned out in sweet, pinkish-orange buttery slivers under a mound of greens, herbs and flowers. The impossibly tender beef filet is nestled among one of these kaleidoscopic salads, the meat kissed with yuzu and fresh coriander, as is the eggplant dengaku, which is cooked to a puddinglike fudge along with sweet white miso and served over organic quinoa. If this sounds a little like the gluten-free grain bowls in high demand down the hill in Byron, that’s exactly what it is, upgraded considerably by a dose of deft Japanese technique and flavor.

The short list of burgers here has influences beyond Japan, with extras like Greek halloumi cheese or a sauce made from Spanish-smoked paprika. The patties are shot through with fennel and coriander, and that halloumi burger also sports korokke, a crispy potato patty described on the menu as a Japanese hash brown.

Customers are mainly locals — the restaurant has no website; no one else would know to make the drive up here — but that “local” designation has wide meaning. This part of the world still has a true rural Australian soul, but it now has some of the highest property values in the country, thanks mainly to its proximity to Byron Bay (a former hippie mecca that has morphed into a playground for the moneyed boho set). The customers sitting on the worn wooden benches in Doma’s yard range from newcomers wearing designer linen caftans — colored to match their designer dogs — to tradespeople in dusty boots on their lunch break. If there’s a tension between the two types of locals, it feels easy here among the chickens and flowers.

At breakfast, there are egg and bacon sandwiches, very good espresso drinks and breakfast sushi hand rolls. If you’ve ever wondered what a Japanese hash brown tastes like when rolled up in nori, here’s your chance. (Answer: silly, salty, a little unnecessary, but fun above all else.) The Doma Brekkie is a huge plate of creamy scrambled eggs, a pile of bacon, alarmingly red tomato slices, avocado, sweet onion relish, and sourdough or Japanese brown rice.

In so many ways, Doma is an exemplar of the great Australian cafe — international in its scope, wonderfully casual, but blessed with quality and creativity worthy of fine dining. There’s even avocado toast at breakfast. Of course there is.

There, above layers of earth that mark geological time, lie relatively new remnants attesting to the massacres carried out by both the Shining Path guerrillas and the military and police forces that hunted them.

A soggy, wrinkled skirt. A skull. Fragments of a spinal column. All that remains of the many men, women and children caught in the crossfire of a war they never wanted. When these remains are lifted from their unmarked graves, they bring with them the chance to be identified, to give their survivors an idea of what happened. To give them something they can bury, and mourn.

Max Cabello Orcasitas, a Peruvian photojournalist, had been intrigued by the exhumations taking place in the region, which was among the hardest-hit by the political violence 30 years ago. He had read about it in a report by the country’s truth commission that offered an accounting of the crimes and killings that were carried out during these dirty wars.

“It struck me as a little-known tragedy,” Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said. “It was like that place in Yugoslavia where there were massacres, Srebrenica. This was like a Peruvian Srebrenica.”

There were few exhumations going on when he traveled to the region in 2009, but that worked in his favor, since he wanted to get to know the area’s residents before broaching uncomfortable topics. So he spent his time photographing daily life.

“It was important to start that way,” he said. “I had seen previous reports that concentrated just on the exhumations. I wanted to show the people of Chungui as they lived, including their festivals, celebrations and religious ceremonies, because that shows a type of recovery after the trauma. I didn’t want to just go in and say ‘Tell me about your tragedies.’”

But it can also show what has not changed, especially in the remote hamlet of Oronquoy, in an area nicknamed the Dog’s Ear, where the military had dragooned some residents into “self-defense” groups that carried out extrajudicial killings.

There are lingering resentments over these violent acts, especially since many of the people responsible for the massacres have never been tried, or are in the early stages.

“There are sectors of the Army that have tried not to deal with this,” he said. “It’s a difficult topic. And I imagine the police and military don’t want to talk about what happened. There is a political strategy to let time pass.”

But time has stood still in Oronquoy, which can be reached only after driving and hiking for hours.

“Some people said the exhumations opened old wounds,” he said. “But others thought the tragedy could shed light on how abandoned the area had been. Not only had there been massacres, but they continue living without access to roads or hospitals.”

If anything, Mr. Cabello Orcasitas said, the impoverished residents of this area are making dual demands.

“They want not only justice but economic development,” he said. “These are areas that were and continue to be very poor, with 80 percent of the population living in extreme poverty. They are demanding from the state attention and development.”

For someone employed on the busy streets, Ms. Terrazas said, “the point is to be seen.”Not a groundbreaking concept, exactly.
As fashion’s early adopters, working women routinely took up what their respectable contemporaries shunned as too showy, tasteless or new.
The more down-market variations flaunt fishnets, kinky boots, hot pants, fur chubbies and harnesses.
“It became such an iconic piece on the set,” Ms. Terrazas said.","That look is dated, for sure, bearing little resemblance to what many prostitutes actually wear, but those images have proliferated just the same, a common sight this fall at concerts, on theater screens and in a flurry of luxury ad campaigns.

Seedily costumed streetwalkers are a magnet to fans of “The Deuce,” about 1970s-era Times Square and the rise of its infant pornography industry. A leather-clad vixen grinds her stilettos into a fleshy male torso in one of the Steven Klein videos on display this month in “Fetish,” an exhibition organized in partnership with Visionaire magazine at the venerable Sotheby’s auction house. And a manga-inspired old-school prostitute, resplendent in shrill fuchsia fur, is among the vivid attractions of “Blade Runner 2049.”

The very prevalence of such images, overworked as they may be, is a testament to their durability. It is reason enough to look more closely at a position advanced by scholars and style arbiters alike: that the clothes we wear, or might like to wear, owe a very real debt to the world’s most ancient profession.

“Fashion right now is influenced by hookers,” said Anna Terrazas, the costume designer of “The Deuce.” “It’s not the other way around.” In a sea of eye-numbing conventionality, a maverick appearance is their signature. For someone employed on the busy streets, Ms. Terrazas said, “the point is to be seen.”

Not a groundbreaking concept, exactly. “There is an untold history of the relationship between sex workers and fashion,” said Rebecca Arnold, a fashion historian and lecturer at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. As fashion’s early adopters, working women routinely took up what their respectable contemporaries shunned as too showy, tasteless or new.

“The dubious woman could be more outlandish in her dress, and more experimental,” Ms. Arnold said. “She is allied with the idea of fashion as linked, not necessarily with the avant-garde, but with the beginning of new dress trends.”

Among the more fashionably progressive were the grandes horizontales of the 19th century, courtesans like Cora Pearl, a client of Charles Worth, the era’s first celebrity designer; and Catherine Walters (Skittles to her public), riveting on horseback as she paraded through Hyde Park sewn into her riding ensembles. Her style was much copied by noblewomen of the day.

More recently, to hear it from the prostitutes themselves, down-market variations on that patrician theme have been reduced to a series of musty clichés.

“Fashion doesn’t produce a vast range of ideas of what female sexuality looks like,” said Annie Sprinkle, a writer, sex educator and former prostitute. Stereotypes abound, she noted, with the upper echelons of the profession embodied by the aspirational up-and-comer cloaked in cashmere and silk and the role-play specialist dressed in pinstripes or a schoolgirl smock. The more down-market variations flaunt fishnets, kinky boots, hot pants, fur chubbies and harnesses.

It’s a visual code dating at least from the ’70s, tatty and archaic even then. Yet it is routinely resurrected by top-tier designers including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander Wang, each gussying up his offerings in sumptuous fabrics or in a mash-up of fetish, athletic and military gear, to tamp down the steamy aggression and make the look palatable to an affluent clientele.

Photo

The gambit works. “In the disco era, fashion was inspired by drag queens and prostitutes,” said Tom Fitzgerald, one half of Tom & Lorenzo, an opinionated fashion blog. “Fashion in general is always borrowing from street wear, and it doesn’t get more street wear than hooker.”

Those references, fixtures in the lexicon of style, are mainstream now. “Is there a specific sex worker look anymore?” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “Or does it all get pulled from the sexy pile at Forever 21?”

Like hip-hop and grunge, “the look has been normalized,” he said. “It’s never been more respectable.”

Or apparently more covetable.

In “The Deuce,” Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the prostitute Candy, swivels her hips in a working-girl wardrobe of short shorts, skimpy tops and lightly soiled coats. The actress reminisced the other day about her fixation with its centerpiece, a boxy fur chubby, a down-market variation on a famously scandalizing look introduced in the ’70s by Yves Saint Laurent, one inspired by the wartime prostitutes of the Rue Saint-Denis.

Seemingly unaware of its provenance, Ms. Gyllenhaal went on, “I wanted to wear that jacket in every scene.”

She wasn’t alone. “It became such an iconic piece on the set,” Ms. Terrazas said. “All of the girls were, like, ‘I want a jacket like that.’”

Pop performers like to tap the look as an assertion of power, often treading a fine line between owning their sexuality and trading on it. Cardi B, a retired “stripper-ho,” as she boasts, has been accused of glamorizing prostitution. She makes no apology.

Nor does Nicki Minaj, who turned up at a fashion show this fall wearing lace-up hot pants, over-the-knee boots and an ermine stole, her image an echo of Julia Roberts’s pre-makeover turnout in “Pretty Woman.”",It’s Always Fishnets Season Somewhere,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/sex-worker-prostitute-fashion-the-deuce-blade-runner.html

About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services.","She had been living in her own apartment in Queens, but after the diagnosis she moved back into her childhood home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, sharing the space with her mother and other relatives.

Feeling anxious, Ms. Ramirez started smoking up to two packs a day. “I used to wake up smoking cigarettes,” she recalled. “Smoking made me calm.”

Ms. Ramirez had also experienced a long bout of grief. In one year, she had buried several close relatives who had contracted HIV from infected needles. “There were so many funerals,” she said. She lost five of her siblings in the space of a few years.

Ms. Ramirez was also a marijuana smoker, but she began increasingly using the drug by herself, multiple times a day. “I used to have to do it just to move around, cook, clean, to do whatever it was I wanted to do,” she said.

It took doctors two years to find a prescription that eased her schizophrenia symptoms without drastic side effects. During this time, she gained about 100 pounds, doubling her weight.

For about a decade, Ms. Ramirez has received mental health and wellness services through Brooklyn Community Services and its predecessor. When she started coming to the agency, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, she often slept sprawled on a covered radiator by the window in the common area and did not socialize.

Outside the agency, she continued smoking marijuana. But Ms. Ramirez said she hated how people would look at her and comment on her red eyes and the stench of her clothes.

In 2010, she began an integrated dual disorder treatment program to combat her mental illness and her drug use.

“It was like coming out of a cloud,” Ms. Ramirez said of quitting marijuana. Over the years, she regained her senses of taste and smell, which had been dulled by smoking. “It was like I was waking up,” she added.

Within a few months of kicking her drug habit, she joined a weekly smoking-cessation group through Brooklyn Community Services. “I quit cold turkey,” she said. Most in the group used nicotine patches to transition, but not Ms. Ramirez. “I didn’t want to leave one addiction for another,” she said, adding: “I wanted to make that change. I was ready to make that change.”

Art therapy, offered by the organization, helped her through the withdrawal symptoms, she said. Ms. Ramirez, who had drawn since she was a teenager, took to the method quickly. And in 2012, the organization featured Ms. Ramirez’s pencil and ink drawings at its annual art show. Her series of bodiless faces in pinks, blues and grays depicted long lashes blooming from almond eyes, hairstyles of tight circles, the faces surrounded by hearts and cubes.

Her mother, Carmen Rivera, came to the show. “She said, ‘Thank you for giving me my daughter back,’” Ms. Gwinnell, the recovery specialist, recalled.

Ms. Ramirez is grateful, too. “Thank you for getting me back,” she told Ms. Gwinnell recently.

In May, Ms. Ramirez, a mother of three adult children, moved into a one-bedroom apartment on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the first home she has had to herself since her diagnosis about 25 years ago. Ms. Ramirez receives monthly $735 in Social Security Income and $150 in food stamps and pays $162 in subsidized rent. In July, Brooklyn Community Services used $300 from the Neediest Cases Funds to buy her, among other household items, two sets of window curtains, a lamp and a shower curtain.

After living with family for so long, Ms. Ramirez said she particularly enjoyed having full rein over the kitchen. No longer the shadow on the radiator, she likes socializing and sharing favorite Puerto Rican dishes like fritters and flan with others at the organization.

Ms. Ramirez, who dropped out of school in 10th grade when she was pregnant with her first child, said she would like to earn her high school equivalency diploma. Having previously worked in fast food and other industries, she wants to pursue a career as a chef. She might also try to display her artwork in a neighborhood gallery.

But for now, she is focused on her health. About a year ago, she became depressed and withdrawn and sought help again through Brooklyn Community Services. She has not been hospitalized for over 10 years. In addition to drawing, she meditates frequently.

“You have to put your part in,” she said of remaining drug-free. “A miracle doesn’t just walk in the door. If you want to quit, you have to be understanding and compassionate with yourself.” Ms. Ramirez smiled. “Today,” she added, “I walked in with my health.”",‘Coming Out of a Cloud’ After Drug Abuse and Mental Illness,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/nyregion/coming-out-of-a-cloud-after-drug-abuse-and-mental-illness.html

Are we somehow complicit when we encounter art in a safe, gilded house? Or, in fact, can grappling with the arts, including this powerful opera, be a way to take action and exert will?

Photo

In this audacious opera — for which Tom Cairns, the director of the production, wrote the libretto in collaboration with Mr. Adès — the music digs deep. Mr. Adès’s wild, searing score explores the emotional undercurrents of the story and fleshes out the horror of the characters’ situation.

My one reservation about the opera when I first heard it was that to some degree, Mr. Adès explored the dark side of Buñuel’s tale, which has been seen as a bitter critique of elite classes during Franco’s regime in Spain, at the expense of its bizarrely comic elements.

But after hearing it at the Met, I feel different. Mr. Adès’s thorny, modernist music, played with crackling precision and color by the orchestra, bristled with manic, almost madcap, energy.

Take the crucial opening scenes, which hew pretty closely to the film. The servants of the house, who somehow sense disaster coming, have fled; and the hostess, Lucía de Nobile (the bright-voiced soprano Amanda Echalaz) is frantic with embarrassment. Her prickly husband, Edmundo (the suave tenor Joseph Kaiser), is also utterly indignant.

But Mr. Adès captures both the tension and absurdity of the crisis in a complex ensemble. The hosts greet their guests with unctuous exchanges, while the visitors, in overlapping and comically elongated phrases, voice refrains of “Enchanted, enchanted,” as the orchestra erupts with jumpy outbursts.

Video

The effect here is compounded by a prankish yet gripping touch in Mr. Cairns’s brilliant staging. The set (by Hildegard Bechtler, who also designed the costumes) shows a salon, with fine couches and glittering tables, framed by a large wooden structure that resembles an opera house proscenium. Only when the guests arrived onstage did the chandeliers in the Met’s auditorium start rising to the roof.

Though “The Exterminating Angel” is a true ensemble piece, Mr. Adès gives distinct character traits and defining musical moments to most of the 15 solo roles. The coloratura soprano Audrey Luna, whose stratospheric upper range was put to use by Mr. Adès in his previous opera “The Tempest” (presented at the Met in 2012) excels as Leticia, an opera singer who had starred in the performance the guests have attended: The dinner party is in her honor.

But as hours and days go by, and everyone becomes increasingly confused and degraded, Leticia unravels, dispatching accusations in vocal bursts that reach screechy highs, yet somehow sound angelic.

Another guest, Blanca, a pianist (the mezzo-soprano Christine Rice), agrees to play something. In the film, the character performs a snappy 18th-century keyboard piece. Mr. Adès substitutes his own haunting variations on a song from the Ladino tradition of Sephardic Jews, music that captures the ambiguity of the moment.

It’s as if Blanca is searching through music’s past for clarity and willpower, yet speaking in a confused modern voice. Blanca arrives with her husband, Alberto (baritone Rod Gilfry), a conductor, and Leticia’s colleague, who proceeds to fall asleep on a couch while confusion reigns.

Photo

The soprano Sally Matthews brings a radiant voice and natural allure to Silvia de Ávila, a young widowed aristocrat who has a strangely close relationship with her prissy brother, Francesco (the vibrant countertenor Iestyn Davies).

Two tragic guests, in the face of unreality, seek solace together. Beatriz (the soprano Sophie Bevan) and Eduardo (the tenor David Portillo) are engaged and utterly absorbed in themselves. But Mr. Adès enshrouds them in the opera’s most rapturous music, an extended duet with sighing vocal lines and quizzical orchestral sonorities. In a suicide pact, the couple enjoy their first night of love in a closet, where they are later discovered dead.

The veteran bass John Tomlinson commands the stage as the elderly Doctor Conde, who is accompanied by his terminally ill patient Leonora, a needy woman obsessed with the occult, here the compelling mezzo-soprano Alice Coote.

As an opera composer, Mr. Adès often has the orchestra hug every note and syllable of a vocal line. This stylistic trait could easily be overdone. But the chords and sonorities he comes up with at once buttress and shake up vocal lines, so the effect, in his hands, lends intriguing dramatic complexity. Over all, this riveting, breathless, score — full of quick-cutting shifts, pointillist bursts, and episodes of ballistic intensity — may be his best work.

The anguished scene that will stay with me for a long while came late, a moment of motherly longing, when Silvia, now grimy, haggard and delirious, thinks about her little boy. She sings a fractured lullaby while caressing the head of a dead sheep (and how actual sheep come into the picture, I won’t give away). Silvia sounds as if she is recalling some distant, old hymn tune. Yet the disjointed orchestra grumbles ominously in its depths while miniature violins play weirdly high, skittish sounds.

The bad blood between Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union stems from disagreements over pensions.
As for the future of his relationship with the teachers’ union, Mr. Sweeney was uncertain.","Additionally, the money flooding this race by Democrats would, in other years, be spent propping up other candidates around the state.

The legislative skirmish could also imperil the agenda of Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor, who has a significant lead in the polls.

Should Mr. Sweeney lose, Mr. Murphy’s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15, provide more funding for Planned Parenthood and legalize marijuana would face a much more difficult legislative path, not just because the Democratic advantage in the Senate would shrink, but because Mr. Sweeney is an adroit power broker.

Mr. Murphy, who has the support of Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union, has chosen not to take sides, a stance that some Democratic leaders have privately complained about and that could lead to a strained relationship if Mr. Murphy is elected governor.

“This is one where folks don’t always, where three parties, don’t always come out to the same conclusion,” Mr. Murphy said, referring to himself, Mr. Sweeney and the union. “I’m on the line with him, on the ballot with him, and trying to get him elected, and, to his credit, he’s trying to get me elected.”

Mr. Murphy would not say if he would ask the teachers’ union to stop campaigning against Mr. Sweeney.

“The one thing I’ve done explicitly is to be there beside him, and that’s the reason I was texting him today,” Mr. Murphy said about Mr. Sweeney. “Because I said, ‘Listen, I want to come down and campaign with him, go door to door, be visible and be seen with him.’”

Mr. Sweeney said he believed that Mr. Murphy had sought to quietly reach out to the union.

“He told me he tried,” Mr. Sweeney said. “So I’m going to take him at his word, even though there have been publications and people saying that he didn’t. Because he said he did. And I want to work with Phil next year.”

Other Democrats have jumped into the fray. Last month, 16 Democratic state senators signed a letter to Marie Blistan, the president of the union, condemning its strategy.

“It’s inconceivable to us that the N.J.E.A. is supporting Republican extremist Fran Grenier, an avowed ally of Chris Christie and Donald Trump, both of whom have demonized teachers and unions throughout their political careers,” the letter said.

The teachers’ union claims that its effort to unseat Mr. Sweeney is driven by its members.

“Our members made it extremely clear that they want to see a change of leadership,” said Steve Baker, the union’s director of communications. “Clearly, Steve Sweeney is very, very well financed. He has the support of a lot of people who have been able to put a lot of money into his campaign, and in order to run a strong campaign, we’ve had to also step up and be willing to invest in that endorsement that our members made.”

Mr. Grenier did not respond to emails requesting comment.

As the race enters its final days, the teachers’ union has continued its advertising blitz. Since Sept. 27, Garden State Forward, the “super PAC” run by the union, has spent nearly $3 million on television advertisements, including $600,000 to broadcast one attack ad during a single week, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that tracks ad spending.

To put the roughly $3 million worth of television commercials in context, that is more than Mr. Murphy’s campaign has spent on broadcast ads throughout the state during the general election, according to Advertising Analytics.

Mr. Sweeney said the union has also distributed pamphlets critical of him to legislators and candidates in other districts, a move that he interpreted as the union issuing a warning about what happens when an elected official crosses the labor group.

“This is sending a message to the other legislators,” Mr. Sweeney said.

The bad blood between Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union stems from disagreements over pensions. In 2011, Mr. Sweeney pushed a bill that became law limiting state contributions to pension and health benefits. Last year, Mr. Sweeney broke his promise to support a constitutional amendment that would require the state to make full pension payments every quarter.

For the teachers, this was unforgivable.

Despite the onslaught, Mr. Sweeney said he was confident that he would prevail. As for the future of his relationship with the teachers’ union, Mr. Sweeney was uncertain.

“The bigger question is how do they figure on going forward with me,” he said. “I’m not a grudge guy by any means. But they’ve made this pretty personal.”",New Jersey Teachers’ Union Wages Costly War Against Powerful Democrat,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/nyregion/nj-teachers-union-wages-costly-war-against-powerful-democrat.html

Major unions see a plot to strip away labor protections with happy talk of government support that will never materialize. Many doubt that Mr. Macron can find the money to bolster the safety net.

“Flexicurity is just fancy packaging,” said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels. “So far, it’s all flexibility and no security.

“Mr. Macron is handing out tax cuts to the richest 10 percent,” she continued. “They will do the labor reforms, and then they will tell you that there is no money for anything else.”

That France needs change is a given. Its unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and has risen even as the picture has improved in countries worst hit by the European crisis like Spain, Italy and Portugal. Nearly one in four young people is unemployed.

But how to generate more jobs provokes fierce argument.

Unions pin blame for high unemployment on weak demand for goods and services. Pay workers more, they say, and spending will be unleashed through the French economy, generating jobs.

The unions are often caricatured as intransigent obstacles to progress, and they have a way of amplifying that image. Ask the CGT — a major union that has struck the most combative stance against the changes — for its plan to fix France. Its leaders call for cutting the workweek from the current 35 hours to a mere 32. Then, they say, more people will be needed.

To the government, this type of thinking — prime material for French lampooning — exemplifies how the country has failed to adapt. Renault, the French automaker, now manufactures cars in Romania, where wages are a fraction of those in France. Restricting work invites an exodus of jobs to lower-wage countries.

What France needs, Mr. Macron asserts, is flexibility that can free entrepreneurs from the strictures of an outmoded labor code. The changes are supposed to make it possible for start-up companies to pay lower wages in their early stages, rather than having to hew to national labor contracts that govern janitors, agricultural workers and people on assembly lines.

In contrast to years past, when labor militancy killed stabs at an overhaul, the government has this time won the cautious assent of some unions. Strikes in recent weeks have failed to inflict much disruption, underscoring a sense that the changes are essentially a done deal.

Still, the CGT vows to battle on, accusing the government of an appalling attack on the rights of laborers.

“Macron is suggesting a total societal change that goes against what has guided French society since the end of World War II,” said Manu Blanco, a board member of the CGT. “He is suggesting a model of extreme individualism, where workers earn hardly anything.”

Whatever the merits, Mr. Macron’s move does pose a historic challenge to power dynamics between working people and their bosses. Under a law adopted in 1884, unions were enshrined as the sole official representatives of French employees. They have maintained broad authority over national wages and working conditions ever since.

Over the last two decades, companies have extracted the right to hire temporary workers. The fresh changes allow smaller companies to negotiate directly with workers, while enabling larger companies to work out agreements with unions tailored to local conditions.

“The fundamental inspiration of these reforms is the idea that protection of workers has gone too far,” said Michel Pigenet, an expert in the history of labor movements at the Sorbonne in Paris. “That, in a globalized system, these protections are a constraint on competitiveness and the economy.”

The government and its advisers frequently cite Germany as an inspiration for their labor plan. After German employers gained greater latitude over wages in the 1990s, joblessness dropped significantly. German companies became more competitive.

But much of that boost came via a drop in pay. Poverty has risen in Germany along with the numbers of people depending on government aid. This has corresponded with an increase in part-time work.

“It’s not a model,” said Eric Beynel, a spokesman for Solidaires, a French union that opposes the labor changes. “It’s been a catastrophe.”

The new rules are directed at lowering the unemployment rate. But joblessness is at best an incomplete indicator of economic health.

In many major economies — strikingly, in the United States and Britain — the unemployment rate has fallen sharply, yet average wages are lower than a decade ago, after accounting for inflation. Many new jobs are low-paying, part-time positions.

French unions cite these realities as backing for their fight. In their vernacular, competitiveness and flexibility are just euphemisms for diminished livelihood and anxiety.

But only 8 percent of the French work force belongs to a union. The unions opposing the new rules are vulnerable to charges that they accept joblessness for the masses as the price of protecting their narrow segment of French workers — a group that trends white and male.

“Their clients are insiders, so they defend insiders,” said Agnès Bénassy-Quéré, an economist who chairs the Economic Analysis Council, which advises the French government on policy.

On a recent morning at the unemployment office in the 19th Arrondissement of Paris — an area home to many North African immigrants — people lining up for assistance tended not to see unions as a force in their lives.

“It’s hard to find jobs,” said Sara Omari, 36, a Tunisian immigrant. “It’s easier for French people.”

Economists doubt the central premise of the labor plan — that easing firing will inspire companies to hire. “In the short term, it will actually make it easier to destroy jobs,” said Eric Heyer, an economist at SciencesPo, a university in Paris. “A lot of businesses have too many people.”

The Nordic-style support system is posited as a cushion against joblessness while allowing workers to make a transition to more fruitful careers.

Given that France already has national health care, a minimum wage and generous social welfare programs, this is not fanciful. Mentioning the Nordic model to a labor economist tends to elicit the same reaction as references to Provençal cuisine for a gastronome.

But the Nordic model is as much a cultural phenomenon as a set of codified rules, a spirit of collective prosperity spanning labor and management.

“The level of confidence between the social partners is at a very high level,” said Oystein Dorum, chief economist at NHO, the main employers’ association representing Norwegian businesses in negotiations with unions. “There’s a sense from the other side of the table that wage claims must be reasonable so we can protect enterprises, and profitable enterprises lead to more jobs.”

The unpleasantries of budget arithmetic may pose the biggest challenge of all.

Mr. Macron has vowed to trim spending as he strives to comply with European limits on public debt. That imperative has special force as the French president woos German support for his proposals to further integrate the countries that share the euro currency. Winning Germany’s blessing requires that France demonstrate a commitment to European budget rules, which are revered in Berlin (except when Germany is breaking them).

Mr. Macron appears to have wrested the upper hand. Parliament will most likely ratify his changes before the end of the year. Then, the tougher challenge commences — proving that greater risk translates into greater security in a nation that has long revered equality.",Nordic-Style Designs Sit at Heart of French Labor Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/business/france-labor-reform-economy-macron.html

Premium subsidies, which are unaffected by the president’s actions, will protect you from premium price increases.

The loading of cost increases onto silver plans also makes it hard to easily describe how much more expensive insurance will be next year, compared with this year. The consulting group Avalere Health published a report Wednesday saying that the average silver plan on HealthCare.gov would increase in price by 34 percent — by far the largest annual price increase since the Obamacare markets began.

Normally, that silver price increase is a good barometer for what’s happening with the entire health insurance market. But the Avalere report highlighted that the prices of other plan types aren’t rising as fast. Gold plans are going up, on average, by 16 percent. Bronze plans are rising, on average, by 18 percent.

Some of those increases are probably because of Trump administration actions as well. The government has cut back on advertising and outreach to help enroll healthy customers, and has signaled that it may not enforce the government mandate to obtain insurance as vigorously as the Obama administration did. In their filings with regulators, insurance companies said they were increasing premiums to address that broader policy uncertainty.

THE GROWN-UPS’ Table

By Gabrielle Hamilton

For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.

I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.

Setting The Table In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”

Enjoy your meal.

To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.

I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.

Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.

But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.

And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.

Questlove 1/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him. What food would you serve? I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created. Where would you host it? I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in. What would you be drinking? Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out. What sort of music would you play? Sixties music from Detroit. How would you get people to leave? They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house. Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018. Alice Waters 2/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate. What food would you serve? Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine. Where would you host it? At home. What would you be drinking? Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner. What sort of music would you play? Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room. How would you get people to leave? I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye. Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse. Busy Philipps 3/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Jason Greene, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz. What food would you serve? A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do. Where would you host it? At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown. What would you be drinking? Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink. What sort of music would you play? Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music. How would you get people to leave? I just go to bed. People get the hint. Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO. DJ Khaled 4/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite. What food would you serve? Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant. Where would you host it? My home. What would you be drinking? Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine. What sort of music would you play? Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé. How would you get people to leave? I would just keep bringing dessert out. DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June. John Waters 5/5 Whom would you invite to

your dinner party? Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served! What food would you serve? Liver. Shut up and eat it. Where would you host it? In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd. What would you be drinking? Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A. What sort of music would you play? King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould. How would you get people to leave? Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.” The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.

I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.

But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their pensione. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.

And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.

But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.

Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.

Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.

But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter’s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising.
In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.
On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011.
Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda.","Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, is now at the center of congressional investigations into the Russian intervention in the 2016 election. Kremlin-linked operatives deployed paid human “trolls” and hordes of fake accounts on Twitter and Facebook to push news and conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and criticism of the United States government. But RT and Sputnik, both of them funded by the Kremlin, worked openly, using platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to amplify content critical of Mrs. Clinton, sometimes paying for advertisement to boost their stories more aggressively.

Now the Silicon Valley companies — long used to practically unchallenged clout in Washington — face rising calls for tighter regulation from both conservatives and liberals and growing scrutiny of their sheer market dominance. Twitter’s general counsel will testify publicly before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.

Last month, Facebook said it would adopt new rules to bring greater transparency to advertising on its platform. Earlier this week, Twitter said it would add new labels to political ads on the service, identifying the ads’ sponsors.

But representatives of Facebook and Google declined to say whether they would follow Twitter’s lead in banning RT and Sputnik advertising. Both companies have recently disclosed that Russian agents purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of advertising on their platforms during the campaign.

Lawmakers who have been pressuring Twitter to address Russian entities’ use of the platform to influence American politics praised the company’s decision on Thursday — but cautioned that it would not be enough.

“I appreciate the effort, although RT and Sputnik have been known entities for some time,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has emerged as one of Twitter’s most vocal critics on Capitol Hill. “What I hope is we’ll see enhanced efforts on discovering other fake accounts as well as avatars that might not be as obvious.”

Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and John McCain of Arizona, who introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this month that would force Facebook, Google and other technology companies to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising, said the action only underscored the need for a new, across-the-board standard for social media companies to follow when it comes to political advertising.

“Twitter’s announcement today is a positive step, but one company preventing two outlets — RT and Sputnik — from placing ads on its platform is not a substitute” for government regulation, Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement.

Twitter, with 328 million monthly active users, is far smaller than Facebook, and has struggled more to find growth and financial stability. In September, the company’s vice president for policy, Colin Crowell, met with staff from House and Senate intelligence committees and shared copies of advertisements run on Twitter by RT’s three principal Twitter accounts. In a public statement, Twitter said that RT had purchased about $274,100 in advertising aimed at United States markets in 2016, promoting close to 2,000 Tweets.

On Wednesday, Twitter provided additional information, disclosing that Twitter had earned a total of $1.9 million in advertising revenue from RT since 2011. The company said it would now donate the money to research into the civic impact of Twitter, as well as its abuse by purveyors of fake news and propaganda.

Despite the sharp response from RT and Russian authorities, it is unclear how much impact Twitter’s decision will have on the growing threat of fake news and disinformation across its platform. Much of the Russian-sponsored activity surrounding the United States election did not involve advertising by official Russian outlets, but covert intervention: undercover human “trolls” on social media, Facebook pages impersonating American activists, and networks of automated Twitter accounts designed to amplify real and made-up news.

“I think it’s only a drop in the bucket,” said Nina Jankowicz, an expert on Russian disinformation at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. “What’s far more dangerous and expansive than RT and Sputnik’s ad buys is the content and messaging promoted by the Russian bot network active on Twitter, which doesn’t need to buy a single ad to garner impressions and interactions sometimes numbering in the thousands.”

Moreover, Twitter’s decision to limit RT and Sputnik could raise questions about how Twitter — and rival social media companies — treat other state-run or state-subsidized news organizations operating on their platforms. Across the world, governments have made aggressive use of Twitter and Facebook to drive their own messaging and propaganda. China, for example, while banning Facebook within its own country, has flooded the platform with advertising and paid propaganda and used it to promote its state broadcaster, CCTV.

A Twitter spokeswoman said the company’s decision on RT and Sputnik was informed by specific findings of the United States intelligence community, made public in January, and would not affect other government-sponsored outlets.

“This is not about being a state-sponsored news organization,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. “It’s about the behavior of RT and Sputnik during the 2016 election.”",Twitter Bans Two Kremlin-Backed News Outlets From Advertising,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/technology/twitter-russia-today-sputnik.html

Migration has been a constant photographic theme for Mr. Castro Garcia, who was born and raised in Oxford, England, by parents who had immigrated from Spain’s Galicia region seeking economic opportunities. As the son of immigrants himself, Mr. Castro Garcia thought it was necessary that refugees have their voices heard and an opportunity to collaborate in the telling of their stories.

In 2015, as nationalist commentators vilified the new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East, thousands of photos of capsized boats and of desperate immigrants washing ashore in Greece were published. Mr. Castro Garcia thought most of the images he saw were “one-sided” and never reflected the refugees’ viewpoint.

“They were shown as faceless crowd, and there was a real lack of individual personal account,” he said. “I felt very early on that the general audience’s ability to appreciate and think about this subject was being gravely underestimated, and the sensationalistic tone of the language and the images was very one-sided.”

Photo

Mr. Castro Garcia set out to make “less journalistic” images in collaboration with immigrants that he befriended in Greece, France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Austria and Germany. His work has been mostly self-funded, though he did receive a Magnum Foundation grant this year that allowed him to move to Sicily and continue his work.

His project, done in collaboration with the producer Jade Morris and graphic designer Thomas Saxby, has resulted in the self-published book “Foreigner: Migration into Europe 2015-2016,” several exhibits and a pair of short films made in collaboration with two Senegalese refugees, Aly Gadiaga and Madia Souare. In an interview published by Mr. Castro Garcia and Mr. Saxby earlier this year, Mr. Gadiaga spoke about why he journeyed on a smuggler’s boat from Senegal to Italy:

“If you are at home and wake up in the morning and see that your brother and sister have nothing to eat, your mother doesn’t eat, you don’t eat, what would you do if you were me? I didn’t leave because I wanted to. I left because I thought this was the only solution for me to help my family.”

The $35,000 grant from the Smith Fund will allow Mr. Castro Garcia to continue his most recent work on African immigrants in Italy, where he has focused on unaccompanied minors.

The Howard Chapnick grant for leadership in the photojournalism industry was awarded to Michael Shaw, the founder of Reading the Pictures, an online publishing organization that analyzes news, documentary and social media images.

Both Edmund Clark and Alex Majoli were awarded $5,000 fellowships from the Smith Fund today. Mr. Clark was recognized for his multimedia investigation of the unseen consequences of airstrikes and drone warfare in the American-led war on terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Mr. Majoli’s project on the fragmentation and polarization of European identity also involved refugees, consisting of dramatic black and white photographs that were lighted like a theatrical production. The images often removed any context for the subjects, blurring the line between fact and fiction.

Mr. Castro Garcia, who grew up speaking Galician at home and English at school, recalls the Oxford of his youth as “a multicultural place” that while predominately white was also home to many people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.

“I grew up in a pretty tolerant United Kingdom, where racism and these kind of notions were not a massive problem,” he said. “But now certain political figures are feeding people’s fears and have done quite a bit of damage to the way people feel about immigrants.”

One day she spotted offshore a woman fishing from a boat, nets and lines in hand. She never spoke to the woman, but the memory stuck with her throughout her life.

More than 30 years later, she returned to tell the story of that lone fisherwoman.

Photo

Anna Maria Verzino, 81, was born and raised in Casalbordino Lido. Hers had been one of many fishing families in the village, and her father had been taking her fishing since she was 5. Her mother had wanted her to become a tailor — fishing was traditionally men’s work — but Ms. Verzino never wavered from what Ms. Marchionna now calls her “total dedication to the sea.”

Over the years, the village’s fishers moved on to other towns and harbors, but Ms. Verzino is one of the few who remained, and Ms. Marchionna became fascinated with the woman who had become known as “the Bride of the Sea” in her village.

“Anna Maria is full of life,” said Ms. Marchionna, 42. “Hard and sweet at the same time.”

As the sea continuously shifts, so, too, does Ms. Verzino, who lives her life in balance with its tempos — planning her days according to the flow of the tides, the storms that thrash the sea and the fish swept up in her nets.

Photo

Most of Ms. Marchionna’s black and white photographs show Ms. Verzino at work on the water. In some photos, she cleans her nets, in others she untangles lines, pulls her boat ashore, reveals a freshly caught sea star. But even in images in which she is doing other things — sitting in a cafe, taking a walk, or standing in front of a statue of the Virgin of the Sea, a protector of fishermen — the ocean is still present in reflective glimpses and subtle impressions.

“When I found out that the people called her ‘the Bride of the Sea,’ I looked for femininity and poetry in her gestures,” Ms. Marchionna said.

Ms. Verzino’s love for the sea is shown alongside warm interactions with her family on land — as Ms. Marchionna understands it, they are two sides of the same coin: She is tough to love life upon the ocean, but is soft when cooking for great-grandchildren.

Photo

As a girl, Ms. Verzino went with her father to meet the religious pilgrims who had traveled to celebrate the Madonna dei Miracoli, or Madonna of Miracles, feast in the nearby village of Miracoli. Many of the travelers had never seen the ocean before, so she and her father would take them out on their boat and show them the beauty of the Adriatic. These days, she brings back sea stars and shells for the children in town, and tells stories from her time at sea.

This instinct to share experiences from the sea is a trait that photographer and fisherwoman both possess. Now that she has photographed the rhythm of Ms. Verzino’s seafaring life, Ms. Marchionna is in the process of helping tell the stories of other fisherwomen, too.

“I realized that I wanted to tell the woman behind the fisherwoman,” Ms. Marchionna said, “and the sea was just the theater of her story.”

The Opioid Crisis: An Epidemic Years in the Making

The current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in American history. Overdoses, fueled by opioids, are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50 years old — killing roughly 64,000 people last year, more than guns or car accidents, and doing so at a pace faster than the H.I.V. epidemic did at its peak.

President Trump declared the opioid crisis a “public health emergency” on Thursday, though he did not release additional funding to address it. Had he declared it a “national emergency,” as he promised to do in August, it would have led to the quick allocation of federal funds.

The New York Times has been covering the outbreak — from when it started bubbling up in towns around the United States years ago to now, as it decimates communities and families.

Here is a roundup of our best reporting on the epidemic, including short answers to hard questions about it.

Snapshots of a Public Health Crisis

A team of reporters went inside the epidemic, from New England to “safe injection” areas in the Pacific Northwest, to explore the experiences of addicts and those trying to stem the tide. “I don’t know how I’m alive, honestly,” one Massachusetts woman said. Here are their stories .

The youngest members of society have not been exempt from the crisis. Toddlers and young children are increasingly being found unconscious or dead after consuming an adult’s drugs, and a surge of opioid-dependent newborns has forced doctors to rethink treatment .

The Numbers

Our reporters have been deciphering and providing context to masses of data about the many and varied ways opioids are affecting Americans.

Illustrated in a series of maps , here’s how overdose deaths rippled across the United States from 1999 to 2014, along with a breakdown of the large concentration of deaths in regions like Appalachia and the Southwest.

This interactive quiz aims to provide a deeper understanding of the mounting toll by asking readers to compare drug overdose deaths with other causes of death.

Video It’s the deadliest drug crisis in American history. It kills about 90 Americans every day. Here are answers to some key questions about the crisis.

The government’s account of drug deaths in 2016 was the first national data to break down the growth by drug and by state, which revealed that deaths involving synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyls, had risen 540 percent in just three years .

While Mr. Trump fulfilled his vow to add urgency to the rapidly escalating opioid problem, his declaration falls short of the national emergency declaration he had pledged. These are the 28 currently active national emergencies .

Health Care

Drug companies and doctors have been accused of fueling the opioid crisis, but insurers may also be playing a role by making it easier to get opioids than the drugs that treat addiction to them. Here are the findings of our analysis .

With the soaring death toll, routine autopsies are overwhelming medical examiners everywhere. We spoke to Dr. Thomas A. Andrew of New Hampshire, which had more deaths per capita from synthetic opioids than any other state. Dr. Andrew decided to stop practicing medicine and instead minister to the living about the dangers of drugs. “I’m not an alarmist by nature, but this is not overhyped,” he said.

The Upshot reported on prescription drug monitoring programs, a tool that could be more widely used to fight opioid abuse .

Jails and Justice

Heroin users are filling the country’s jails, but recovering addicts are almost always cut off from their medication while incarcerated. Connecticut, though, is trying something new: a methadone treatment program to help inmates successfully re-enter society. We looked at the conundrums detention centers are facing .

Video The Times, in collaboration with the PBS series “Frontline,” followed 10 recently released inmates struggling to succeed on the outside.

On Staten Island, prosecutors are leaping into largely uncharted legal terrain to fight the scourge: charging dealers in overdose deaths . And a New York Times Magazine writer traveled to a small town in New Hampshire , where one police officer has been trying to curb the rash of opioid overdoses.



Dealing in the Digital Age

The internet is proving to be a grim tool in the opioid drug trade.

On Reddit, one of the world’s largest online communities, opioid forums have offered a place to buy drugs and find solace for people like Rachel Frazier, who posted on Reddit regularly and dipped into drug-related communities such as “opiates.” She died two weeks after seeking drugs in a forum.

Dealers are embracing the dark web to anonymously send powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl to nearly every region of the country. Despite dozens of arrests, new merchants — many of them based in Asia — quickly pop up to fill the void.

Between the early 1990s — when apartheid ended — to the country’s first democratic election in 1994, Mr. Silva, a staff photographer for The New York Times, captured deadly political violence that eventually led to the abolition of its system of racial segregation.

Two decades later, Mr. Silva still finds that stark social tensions continue to divide the country. The divisions are in as much economic terms as they are racial.

“With apartheid gone, with the National party gone, we had this dream that it was all going to be sorted out,” said Mr. Silva, who was born in Portugal and immigrated to South Africa at the age of 9. “Of course, it’s naïve — it is not an easy thing to come to terms with.”

For one month, Mr. Silva traveled through the country on assignment to photograph the different economic classes dividing South Africa’s residents. Mr. Silva has built his career around documenting political unrest — in his adopted home of South Africa, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

But working in conflict regions took a personal toll. In 2010, while on assignment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, he stepped on a land mine, losing both of his legs. After months of intense surgery at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and receiving high-tech prosthetic legs, he slowly began the process of learning how to walk and photograph again, a situation akin to what his country is going through with democratic rule.

During his most recent assignment traveling across South Africa, Mr. Silva found a land of stark contrasts: A densely populated township bordering Cape Town, blanketed with broken glass and garbage (slide 1).

Less than an hour drive away, scantily-dressed women posed for pictures in an upscale nightclub as expensive champagne flowed freely.

In Durban, a coastal city to the east, young surfers prepared to challenge the early morning waves (slide 3).

The economic disparities facing South Africans can be traced back to the first few years after apartheid, when the government transferred large sections of land to the wealthy white elite. Today, 10 percent of all South Africans — mostly white — own more than 90 percent of the national wealth. Almost 80 percent of the population — mostly black — have no land ownership.

Despite these trends, Mr. Silva has slowly seen the rise of middle-class black South Africans in areas like Soweto, a township outside Johannesburg. Once home to Nelson Mandela, it was the center of the anti-apartheid movement and the location of one the country’s deadliest youth uprising in 1976. Today, its streets are filled with vibrant restaurants with young black South Africans and tourists.

Photo

During his reporting, Mr. Silva also met a growing number of entrepreneurs, including Mandla Majabula, who recently opened an internet cafe in Soweto and taught himself how to code.

According to New World Wealth, a consulting firm in Johannesburg, the number of South Africa’s black, Asian and mixed-race millionaires more than doubled from 2007 to 2015.

For this assignment, Mr. Silva said he was looking for quiet moments that captured “human aspects” of each location, which is what he has always tried to embody in his work, even when covering conflict.

“With apartheid gone, we had this dream that is was all going to be sorted out.” — Joao Silva

At one stop, he visited an early morning class at the Sophumelela Secondary School in Mitchells Plain, one of South Africa’s largest townships (slide 2). The light illuminated a group of young boys in their school uniforms, huddled together as they studied from a shared notebook. The moment for Mr. Silva captured South Africa’s past, yet optimism for an uncertain, yet brighter, future.

“It is still very much about the human condition in those kinds situations, even though now the element of danger is not there,” he said.

Mr. Silva considers himself among the lucky few in South Africa who were able to improve their socioeconomic status through education and entrepreneurial pursuits. Growing up in a working class home in the south of Johannesburg, he began studying photography at the age of 21.

Photo

He later gained recognition as a member of the Bang Bang Club, a quartet of photojournalists who covered the country’s transition to democracy.

“Even in my current physical limitation, I am still out there going,” said Mr. Silva. “I spent so many years focusing on conflict, but life is different now and I am changing with everything else that comes with it.”

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

“They are a generation in transition since they are the first to be born here, yet they have not lost their roots,” said Ms. Vincenti, 28. “They are American, but they consider themselves Mexican, too.”

The young people, she said, approach their studies eagerly, unlike those of us who balked at weekly piano lessons as children. Even in their spare time, they kick back and play their instruments just for the fun of it. Recently, a group of teenage students formed their own band, Mariachi Luna Mixteca.

“This is not an extracurricular activity, this is their life,” Ms. Vincenti said. “It is a question of being proud of who they are, because being a mariachi is something they are proud of.” She explained that with so much division around and anger at Latinos and their culture, the students “want to reclaim the pride they feel for their roots.”

The profound equality of every individual was an idea that flowed directly from the Hebrew Bible. The story Americans told about themselves was a biblical story — an exodus story of various diverse peoples leaving oppression, crossing a wilderness and joining together to help create a promised land.

The American social structure, as Sacks notes, was based on biblical categories. There was a political realm, but the heart of society was in the covenantal realm: “marriages, families, congregations, communities, charities and voluntary associations.”

America’s Judeo-Christian ethic celebrated neighborliness over pagan combativeness; humility as the basis of good character, not narcissism. It believed in taking in the stranger because we were all strangers once. It dreamed of universal democracy as the global fulfillment of the providential plan.

That biblical ethic, embraced by atheists as much as the faithful, is not in great shape these days. As Sacks notes: “Today, one half of America is losing all those covenantal institutions. It’s losing strong marriages and families and communities. It is losing a strong sense of the American narrative. It’s even losing e pluribus unum because today everyone prefers pluribus to unum.…”

Trump and Bannon have filled the void with their own creed, which is anti-biblical. The American story they tell is not diverse people journeying toward a united future. It’s a zero-sum struggle of class and ethnic conflict. The traits Trump embodies are narcissism, not humility; combativeness, not love; the sanctification of the rich and blindness toward the poor.

As other relationships wither, many Americans are making partisanship the basis of their identity — their main political, ethnic and moral attachment. And the polls show that if you want to win a Republican primary these days, you have to embrace the Trump narrative, and not the old biblical one.

The Republican senators went to the White House and saw a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s. But they know which way the wind is blowing. They gave him a standing ovation.

Even Alexander Kerensky didn’t abase himself so humiliatingly.

The people who oppose Trump make a big error: “Let’s Get Togetherism.” This is the belief that if we can only have a civil conversation between red and blue, then everything will be better. But you can’t destroy a moral vision with a process. You need a counter-moral vision.

The people who reluctantly collaborate with Trump make a different error: economism. This is the belief that Trump’s behavior is tolerable because at least Republicans can pass a tax cut. People who believe that value money more than morals. Trumpism is not just economic, and it can’t be thwarted by passing a bit of economic policy.

This is like 1917, a clash of political, moral, economic and social ideologies all rolled into one.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly.","But whether a similar trade-off occurred with our muscles has remained in doubt. Muscles potentially provided another route to survival during our species’ early days. With sufficient brawn, animals, including people, could physically overpower prey and sprint from danger.

But muscles are also very calorically needy and, like brain tissue, use blood sugar as their primary fuel. So scientists have wondered whether and how early humans’ bodies balanced the fueling needs of their brains and their brawn. Did one take precedence over the other? If so, that choice could tell us something about the underpinnings of human development and also how best, even now, to manage thinking and moving.

Since experiments on cavepeople are, however, not practicable, researchers at Cambridge University in England decided instead to focus on the bodily machinations of 62 elite, collegiate rowers for their new study, which was published this month in Scientific Reports.

The scientists hoped to suss out what happens when both muscles and minds are stressed, and if one of those operations gets preferential treatment from the body.

To find out, they asked the rowers, who were all young, male and fit, to visit a university lab on three separate occasions.

During one visit, the men sat quietly while dozens of words were displayed on a large screen in front of them. The men had three minutes to memorize the words and then, immediately afterward (when the screen went dark) write down as many as they could remember. This was their mental task.

On another day, they rowed on a rowing machine as intensely as they could for three minutes while the researchers tracked their power output, testing muscular prowess.

Finally, on the last visit, they rowed for three minutes while simultaneously viewing a list of new words and then, immediately afterward, writing down as many as they could recall.

Then the researchers simply compared their performance on each task. Almost uniformly, the men had been able to produce fewer watts and recall fewer words when they performed the muscular and mental tasks together.

But the falloff in physical functioning was much steeper than the mental slump. The rowers lost almost 13 percent of their power output, a decline that was about 30 percent greater than their loss in word recall after the combined session.

“Our proposed explanation for this finding is that they were both competing for the same resource,” which in this case was blood sugar for fuel, says Danny Longman, a postdoctoral research fellow at Cambridge who led the study.

And the brain won.

The implication of this victory is that thinking probably provided more advantage for us during evolution than brawniness, Dr. Longman says, and on those occasions that both systems needed to be fed, the brain got its portion first.

Of course, this study was very short-term and viewed the tug-of-war between brains and muscles only indirectly. The researchers did not track actual changes in blood sugar uptake by any tissues. They also looked only at quite-intense exercise and used memory recall as their sole marker for thinking.

But even with these limitations, the study to some extent advances our understanding of how we became the species that we are, Dr. Longman says.

“For me, the main message of this study is a bit philosophical,” he says. “An enlarged and highly functioning brain is one of the key factors that make us human. This study demonstrated, in a very simple way, this defining characteristic of our species.”

Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of a large, bountiful island just north of Australia (the western side is part of Indonesia). In 1998, after decades of relative geological quiet, a devastating tsunami rocked the country, killing more than 2,000 people.

“This huge volume of water struck the coast and swept away everything,” said John Terrell, an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who has completed research in the country and is a co-author on the paper. “The villages I knew and loved were sheared off.”

Following the tsunami, Dr. Goff and some colleagues went to the country to assess the damage. The visit helped spark his interest in investigating whether there was a link between ancient tsunamis and the Aitape skull.

After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier.

Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff. Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago.

Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition.

They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point.

The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago. “Bang! Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and you’re getting excited, you have a signal that says, ‘Hi, I’m seawater,’” said Dr. Goff.

More Reporting on Archaeology

He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale. “Yes, this was a tsunami. And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.”

Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the team’s diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area.

But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event.

Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario.

“Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them,” he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis. “Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.”

The geochemistry analysis supported the authors’ conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didn’t contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — The romantic in Ned White emerges today with a 76-word puzzle that plays around with a popular phrase.

Today’s Theme

I managed to solve the revealer, HEAD OVER HEELS, before I figured out the theme, which may or may not have helped me.

The theme itself places phrases used to designate people as the “head” of something (NUMERO UNO at 13A, for example) on top of phrases used to call someone a “heel” (SCOUNDREL at 17A), thus giving us HEAD OVER HEELS. I liked this idea, and Mr. White does it well, except I had trouble locating the central pair because they were staggered at 56A (BIG WHEEL) and 42A (DIRTY RAT).

Tricky Clues

8A: Yes, a five-letter entry for “One of the Obamas” could be either SASHA or MALIA. But check those crossings. They’re not all easy, but perhaps you knew that a SPORE was “One of billions in a puffball” at 8D.

So did Hearst magazines, which owns Elle, Harper’s Bazaar, Esquire and Marie Claire. Mr. Richardson had already been commissioned to shoot the January cover of Elle and had recently done so. It is now being redone by another photographer.

Bulgari, Diesel and Valentino, all brands that recently worked with Mr. Richardson on their ad campaigns, issued statements stating that they had no plans to work with him in the future.

It all sounds very responsible. But some industry insiders have begun to question whether fashion’s efforts to distance itself from Mr. Richardson is an attempt to Band-Aid over a deeper crisis, to make a public example of an offender already accused in order to appear to be taking action, when a much broader and more systemic approach needs to be adopted.

Edie Campbell, a model who has been featured in campaigns for Chanel and Dior, among others, said: “The reality is that the floodgates are already open regarding Terry Richardson. He’s been blacklisted once before, and it’s not that much of an emotional, psychological or commercial leap to blacklist him again. The difficulty is addressing the other people — the ones who are celebrated by the fashion industry, and who are still at the very heart of it. This will not be solved simply by banning the use of one photographer.”

While there are many creative and morally reputable professionals in the industry, it is also rife with reports of lines being crossed.

“The problem is much larger than Terry, who has become the scapegoat, and the quickest means for this industry to absolve itself from any responsibility,” said David Bonnouvrier, the co-founder of DNA Models.

Katie Grand, the editor of Love magazine and a stylist who works with brands including Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu, and who earlier this week reposted a statement from Ms. Campbell on Instagram to the same effect, wrote in an email: “I don’t want to sound like I’m defending him, but I thought it was important to put into perspective that every model has a story of a photographer, client, art director, stylist behaving inappropriately.”

Mr. Richardson was widely pilloried in 2014 when allegations of behavior that included cavorting naked on shoots and forcing his penis on models surfaced in the news media.

Mr. Richardson has not denied his behavior but has always maintained that any sexual activity was consensual, and no criminal charges were ever filed. No major new allegations have appeared since 2014, and he had reportedly gone through therapy. He recently had twins and got married.

Numerous magazines cut ties with Mr. Richardson around 2014, though he had gradually returned to the industry, working with celebrities including Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé as well as magazines and brands.

When Roberta Myers was the editor of Elle (she recently stepped down), she had forbidden the magazine to work with Mr. Richardson, but after Nina Garcia was appointed as Elle’s new editor, he was commissioned to photograph the actress Zoë Kravitz for the January 2018 cover.

After The New York Times published its account detailing allegations of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment and abuse, Joanna Coles, the chief content officer of Hearst, and Ms. Garcia decided to cancel the Elle cover photographed by Mr. Richardson and to reshoot it, a Hearst spokeswoman confirmed.

American Vogue stopped working with Mr. Richardson in 2010, when the first public statements about his behavior appeared, but in the last two years he had done shoots for Vogue China, Vogue France, Korean W, German GQ and Italian GQ, among others. Recently he shot a story for the November issue of W, a Condé Nast magazine, for the first time since 2011. (Mr. Richardson’s photographs have also appeared in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, but not since 2012.)

A Condé Nast spokeswoman said that Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W, was not available for comment. But according to a person familiar with the shoot who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the magazine had decided it was time to give Mr. Richardson another chance. Editors were on set during the shoot and also handled the model casting.

In the wake of the current revelations about the behavior of men in power, including Bill O’Reilly and Leon Weiseltier, however, Mr. Richardson’s past behavior once again made news. The Sunday Times of London revisited the story (the day before Condé Nast International sent its memo). A petition was started on Change.org asking magazines and other brands to stop using Mr. Richardson; it has over 42,000 signatures.

The designer Prabal Gurung posted on Instagram: “It is important that we hold everyone accountable who worked with Terry Richardson. Not to shame them, but to understand the intention & motive behind their decision to turn a blind eye to his horrific actions. Clearly they cannot say they didn’t know, because we all knew.”

The question now becomes: What else does fashion know?

Trish Goff, a former top model who has spoken about her experience with Mr. Weinstein, said that during her modeling years, “there were other girls and agents who would warn you about a photographer. They’d say, ‘Be mindful of him,’ or “Don’t let him convince you to take off your clothes.’”

Athena Currey, who modeled from 1993 to 2008, said that when she was a 19-year-old working in Paris, her agency sent her on a shoot with a photographer who called her later that night at her hostel to describe how much he wanted to “make love to me.” The next day, she told her agent, a woman, that the conversation made her very uncomfortable and that she did not want to work with him again.

“Everyone said, ‘Of course, of course,’” Ms. Currey said now. “Then a week later, my agent called me and said: ‘I have a really important job, and I really think you should do it. Only it’s with that photographer.’ And then she put a huge amount of pressure on me to get over it and do the job. And I know they sent other girls to him afterward.” The agency, which was a minor presence in the industry, appears to have closed.

None of the models who discussed their experiences for this article said their agents ever talked to them about how to handle unwanted advances from photographers, even if they knew their clients were likely to encounter them.

Carolyn Kramer, a former co-director of Marilyn Models and a former casting director at Self magazine who currently owns an art gallery in Provincetown, Mass., said: “It all came back to the money. If an agency sees potential in a 15-year-old girl, then it doesn’t matter to them what may be happening behind the scenes if the girl can get a campaign. I give myself a C- for what I was able to accomplish to protect my girls. We all sold our souls to the devil so the model could become famous.”

Amber Valletta, a model, actress and activist, said she was asked to take her top off during her first modeling summer in Italy when she was 15 and, on another occasion, was asked by a model booker at a magazine to disrobe. When Ms. Valletta was 18 or 19, she said, a photographer came to her hotel room, asked to give her a massage and began rubbing her breasts.

She said she thought the most important next step was putting structures in place throughout the industry to protect all involved, from garment workers to models.

“My experiences were so minor compared to stories I have heard,” she said. “You start taking one person down, and the skies are going to fall.”

Condé Nast is aware of the risk. On Thursday, in a email to internal management as well as outside contractors, Bob Sauerberg, the chief executive of Condé Nast, and Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman, wrote:

“All employees, freelancers and independent contractors must understand the company’s expectations of appropriate behavior and treatment of others. Condé Nast also expects the agencies that represent hired talent to develop, circulate and reinforce with their clients what is and is not acceptable behavior in interacting with others, with particular emphasis on protecting people who are in vulnerable positions in their professional relationships.”

Ms. Kramer said, “Terry Richardson is just the tip of the iceberg. If magazines distanced themselves from everybody that has been implicated in this kind of behavior, there would be a lot fewer contributing photographers” in their pages.",‘Terry Richardson Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/style/terry-richardson-sexual-harassment-fashion-photographers.html

Which books do you think best capture the current social and political moment in America?

I hate to say it, but I would opt for Philip Roth’s “The Plot Against America.” He shows how a democracy can be corrupted, not by big, blaring events, but by a slow, insidious, almost imperceptible process, like carbon monoxide seeping in under the door. At the end of the story, the menacing Charles Lindbergh vanishes, but by then we have been shocked to the core.

It’s a shameful thing to admit for someone who writes such long books, but I read so slowly that I almost subvocalize. I always sympathize with people who complain about the length of my books. It would take me a year to get through one of them. That’s why I dedicated Grant to “my loyal readers, who have soldiered on through my lengthy sagas.” I savor sentences and can almost taste them in my mouth. Also, I’m still a print dinosaur and like the tactile sensation of turning over pages. The feeling of progress is so much more satisfying than with e-books.

What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?

Well, I’m an old English major with numerous interests in the arts. I enjoy biographies of artists and read about Matisse and Giacometti this past year. With “Hamilton,” I seem to have become an honorary member of the theater community and am drawn to books about that world with John Lahr’s fine biography of Tennessee Williams topping my recent list.

What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?

I loved fanciful books, medieval stories with jousting knights or wild adventures with pirates and plenty of romance in the South Sea. When I was 11, I fell in love with “Mutiny on the Bounty” and only wanted to eat bread fruit and lounge around on Polynesian beaches with lovely native women. My teacher mistakenly thought my interest was in the mutiny and gave me “The Caine Mutiny” to read, a very grown-up book for a boy. But there were no women on the boat, just a grumpy captain grousing about frozen strawberries.

If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?

Oh, that’s an easy choice — the Federalist Papers. It remains the classic gloss on the Constitution and should be required reading for every new president. On the other hand, it’s a bit longer than a tweet and would require a burst of sustained concentration. Maybe a White House aide can tiptoe into the Oval Office and discreetly leave a copy on the president’s desk.

You’re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?

Three clear favorites: Dr. Samuel Johnson, Mark Twain and Jane Austen. I know I wouldn’t get a word in edgewise and would just sit back and watch the fireworks explode. I like to think that, now and then, Lady Jane would interject the wittiest remarks and deflate the considerable egos of her two long-winded male companions. The conversation would be so rollicking and fantastic that we would all forget to eat.

Of the books you’ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?

In the past, like most writers, I’ve fled from this question and mouthed the usual platitudes about loving all my children equally. But I will now break my rule and say that “Grant” is my favorite book and not just because it’s wall-to-wall drama.

Mr. Trump, who has indulged in his own wild speculation about the sensational killing, had expressed eagerness to finally open the last of the government files, only to run into a last-minute campaign by intelligence agencies to redact certain documents. Grudgingly, he gave the agencies until April 26 to go through the remaining papers again and make their case.

“I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” Mr. Trump said in a memo to the agencies. Given their objections, he said, “I have no choice — today — but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our nation’s security.” But he ordered the agencies to “be extremely circumspect,” noting that the rationale for secrecy has only “grown weaker with the passage of time.”

For conspiracy theorists, the Kennedy assassination has been the holy grail, one that has produced an endless string of books, reports, lectures, articles, websites, documentaries and big-screen Hollywood movies. It was the first murder of an American president in the television age, touching off a wave of global grief for a charismatic young leader while also spawning a cottage industry of skeptical questioning of the official version of events.

Every government authority that has examined the investigation of his death, from the Warren Commission to congressional investigators, concluded that Kennedy was killed by Oswald, who fired three shots with a mail-order rifle from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository when the presidential motorcade passed by on Nov. 22, 1963. But that has never satisfied the doubters, and polls have consistently shown that most Americans still believe that someone other than Oswald must have been involved.

While the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone, the House Select Committee on Assassinations said in a 1979 report that Kennedy “was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy” but did not identify who those conspirators might have been. It ruled out the Soviet and Cuban governments, organized Cubans opposing Fidel Castro, the Mafia, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Secret Service, although the committee said it could not preclude that individuals affiliated with some of those groups might have been involved.

Among the doubters have been Mr. Trump, who last year alleged that the father of one of his Republican presidential primary rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was somehow involved in the assassination. The president’s longtime friend and adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. wrote a book accusing Johnson of being responsible for the shooting that elevated him to the presidency.

As it happened, Mr. Trump’s deferral to the C.I.A. and F.B.I. invariably will lead to suspicions that the government is still protecting sensational secrets about the case. Administration officials said there was no cover-up, just an effort to avoid compromising national security, law enforcement or intelligence gathering methods.

The C.I.A., which for years has borne the brunt of suspicions from amateur assassination theorists, went out of its way on Thursday to try to dispel concerns that it was hiding important evidence.

The agency issued a statement noting that the vast majority of assassination-related records have been released, and that redactions were intended “to protect information in the collection whose disclosure would harm national security — including the names of C.I.A. assets and current and former C.I.A. officers, as well as specific intelligence methods and partnerships that remain viable to protecting the nation today.”

The release of the documents owes as much to the moviemaker Oliver Stone as anyone else. After his 1991 conspiracy theory movie “J.F.K.” stoked renewed interest, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which was signed into law by President George Bush on Oct. 26, 1992. The act mandated that all assassination records be released no later than 25 years from that date, which was Thursday, unless the president authorized further withholding for national security reasons.

In the years since the law was passed, the National Archives and Records Administration has released 88 percent of those documents in full and an additional 11 percent with portions redacted. Until Thursday, just 1 percent had been withheld in full.

Of the 2,891 documents released Thursday, only 53 had never been disclosed by the archives; the rest had been made public with redactions.

The papers range widely, and while many are not directly related to the assassination, others add context. One recounted the reaction of the Soviet Union to the killing, reporting that some in Moscow assumed it was a “coup” by the “ultraright” that would be blamed on the Soviet Union. An unnamed informant told American spies that the K.G.B. had proof that “President Johnson was responsible for the assassination.”

An F.B.I. cable from April 1964 reconstructed Oswald’s bus trip to Mexico weeks before the assassination, including the names of the people sitting around him and even what he was wearing: “a short-sleeved light colored sport shirt and no coat.”

In Hoover’s memo two days after the assassination, he expressed anxiety that Oswald’s killing would generate doubts among Americans. “The thing I am concerned about,” he wrote, “is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.” The F.B.I. director also fretted that discoveries that Oswald contacted the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington could “complicate our foreign relations.”

He called the Oswald killing “inexcusable” in light of “our warnings to the Dallas Police Department” and hinted at Ruby’s mob connections, which would soon spawn an industry of research and speculation. “We have no information on Ruby that is firm, although there are some rumors of underworld activity in Chicago,” Hoover wrote.

The documents will not end the debate or speculation — and a few may add to the questions. In a 1975 deposition, for example, Richard Helms, the former C.I.A. director, was asked: “Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an agen…”

But the document ends there, and Mr. Helms’s answer is missing.","J.F.K. Files, Though Incomplete, Are a Treasure Trove for Answer Seekers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-jfk-release.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

My first exposure to rock ’n’ roll came from watching mostly white bands like Nirvana, Korn and Limp Bizkit perform angsty songs on MTV. I bought some of their albums, but the genre didn’t really resonate with me until I learned that black people could be rock ’n’ roll artists too. None had as great an influence on me as Fats Domino, one of the biggest stars of the early rock ’n’ roll era, who died on Tuesday in Harvey, La.



I was raised in a musical household in New Orleans. I played the drums and piano as a child, and my dad played bass. He and his bandmates encouraged me to study the history of rock ’n’ roll, not dismiss it. In one of my weekly runs to Blockbuster’s used CDs section, I found a Led Zeppelin CD, which eventually led me to Jimi Hendrix. He was the first black person I learned about who played rock ’n’ roll — a term I thought was fixed but whose meaning kept expanding.

Around then, I began to play gigs with bands that would occasionally cover Mr. Hendrix’s songs, and it was powerful to watch the audience react. I wanted to be able to tap into that kind of energy too, but also to balance it with something else I couldn’t quite identify yet.

Around 1998, when I was 12 years old, I sat in on one of my father’s gigs and first heard “Blueberry Hill” by Fats Domino. The song seemed deeply familiar; it was almost as if it was otherworldly, floating somewhere in the ether. I had never heard such a percussive piano section. Folks of various ages and races got up to dance and sing along in a joyous communal outburst.

While jazz was born in New Orleans in the early 1900s, and the city played a significant role in shaping rock ’n’ roll, Antoine Domino, known as Fats, was one of the few musicians who bridged those two genres.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask two questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle: They ask if they are supposed to be warned that a rebus exists in the puzzle (No, that’s part of the fun of solving) and they ask how in tarnation they are supposed to put more than one letter in a square if they are solving electronically. I’ll get to that in a minute, but first I’d like to show you what a rebus in a crossword looks like.

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.

The clue was “You might find one at a sawmill,” and the answer is LUMBERJACK, a 10 letter word, but the slot only has room for seven letters. How do you fill in the entire answer?

Step 1: Select the square in which you want to enter a rebus. Click the Rebus button on the toolbar above the clue lists, or simply press Escape (Esc). This will open an expandable square in which you can type multiple characters. Step 2: Type in your answer and press Enter/Return, or click anywhere outside the field to close and save your rebus.

Mariana Vincenti, a Venezuelan photojournalist, followed a group of these students for several months earlier this year. Far from Caracas, she wanted to explore the identities of Latin American immigrants and their children.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — If you were not aware what a Wall Street reformer might want, you will learn it today in Jules Markey’s puzzle. This was a nice midweek theme that kept its secret until the very end for me.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Markey offers us a list theme of phrases that feel fresh: Three of the four make their New York Times Crossword debuts today, as does the revealer. Hidden in each phrase is a word that can be used before the word “BANKS,” and solvers are directed to those words by the circled/shaded squares.

For example, at 17A, the answer to the clue “Weave or tailgate, say” is DRIVE RECKLESSLY. The revealer at 62A, BREAK UP THE BANKS, is a hint that the ultimate answer to 17A is RIVER BANKS.

Tricky Clues

1A/1D: Were you flummoxed by the “Drug referenced in ‘The Joyous Cosmology’ ”? Here’s how to solve that one: First, it’s only three letters, so that narrows things down quite a bit. Second, 1A is fairly easy: The famous LOCH Lomond is in Scotland. With the L in the first square, the answer has to be LSD.

18D: R.V. TRIP is a bit random to my ears, but I know people vacation in Winnebagos.

50D: I didn’t know the director Hal ASHBY, although I know the film “Shampoo” that he directed. I guessed at ASHER, realized it was wrong when I solved 70A’s YMCAS, and guessed again at ASHBY.

Constructor Notes

The idea for this puzzle came during the election season of 2016. The revealer was heard and seen quite often at many campaign rallies, and it’s 15 letters long! It was quite natural then to try to turn it into a puzzle theme. I first thought to use the names of some banks in phrases but found that really wasn’t working, so i quickly settled on types of banks instead. What you see are the theme entries I first came up with, I’m pretty happy with the 4-1; 1-2-1; 1-4; 1-2-1 break patterns. After acceptance, I sent Will a version with all the theme entries spanning the grid, but he felt the fill had been too compromised, so he stayed with this version. Thanks to Will, Joel and team for polishing it up. I hope it was a pleasurable solve.

We got to his home after lunch and I met his domestic staff and his young children. He took me on a brief tour of the house before he rounded us all up in the screening room to watch the film. He had just produced a similar film of his own, but everyone was raving about this rival version.

I settled in for the film, but about 15 minutes in, Harvey came for me, saying he wanted to show me something. I protested that I wanted to finish the film first, but he insisted I go with him, laying down the law as though I too was one of his children. I did not want another back-and-forth in front of his kids, so I complied and left the room with him. I explained that I really wanted to see the film. He said we’d go back shortly.

Harvey led me into a bedroom — his bedroom — and announced that he wanted to give me a massage. I thought he was joking at first. He was not. For the first time since I met him, I felt unsafe. I panicked a little and thought quickly to offer to give him one instead: It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times.

Part of our drama school curriculum at Yale included body work, using massage techniques on one another to understand the connection between body, mind and emotion, and so I felt I could rationalize giving him one and keep a semblance of professionalism in spite of the bizarre circumstance. He agreed to this and lay on the bed. I began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation. Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants. I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that. “If we’re not going to watch the film, I really should head back to school,” I said.

I opened the door and stood by the frame. He put his shirt on and again mentioned how stubborn I was. I agreed with an easy laugh, trying to get myself out of the situation safely. I was after all on his premises, and the members of his household, the potential witnesses, were all (strategically, it seems to me now) in a soundproof room.

Earlier Harvey had sent the driver to the store to buy a boxed collection of “The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency,” an HBO show that he had produced. This was the project he thought I would be right for, he said. (I later found out that the show had not been on the air for some time.) As I prepared to leave his home, he presented it to me. He wanted me to check it out and let him know what I thought. He would be in touch about it. I left for New Haven with his driver.

I didn’t quite know how to process the massage incident. I reasoned that it had been inappropriate and uncalled-for, but not overtly sexual. I was entering into a business where the intimate is often professional and so the lines are blurred. I was in an educational program where I was giving massages to my classmates and colleagues every day. Though the incident with Harvey had made me uncomfortable, I was able to explain and justify it to myself, and shelve it as an awkward moment. His offer to me to be a part of the HBO show was a very attractive one and I was excited about it, especially as I would be graduating in another year. I didn’t know how to proceed without jeopardizing my future. But I knew I would not be accepting any more visits to private spaces with Harvey Weinstein.

I decided to invite Harvey to come to a production I was in at school. Perhaps that way he would really see what I had to offer, and he would see my colleagues, too. He accepted the invitation, but the night of the production, he sent a message saying he had been caught up in New York and would be unable to attend. He would make it up to me. So when I received an official invitation to a staged reading of his new Broadway show, “Finding Neverland,” I was not surprised. I was still debating whether I should accept his invitation, and so I responded saying I was not certain that I could make it because of my school schedule. He responded with exactly the words I needed to hear: Come with whomever you want to come with. And so I invited two of my trusted male friends.

We attended the reading, and afterward Harvey invited us all to a restaurant for dinner with his comrades and collaborators. He sat me next to him, and another actress sat across from me. He had my friends sit at a different table. The talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced. I looked at the actress who I was informed had just worked with him on a project, searching her face for any sort of indication that she too had been made to feel uncomfortable by this powerful man, but of course I saw nothing. We did not stay very long because we had to catch a train back to New Haven. My friends had been equally charmed by Harvey. He knew when to turn it on if he wanted something. He was definitely a bully, but he could be really charming, which was disarming and confusing. I left feeling that perhaps he had learned my boundaries and was going to respect them.

A couple of months later, I received an email from Harvey, inviting me again to New York for a screening of “W.E.” After the screening, we would have drinks in TriBeCa. I then received a phone call from one of his male assistants to arrange my transportation. Feeling more confident about the new sense of boundaries that we had established in our last meeting, I attended the screening on my own this time. Afterward, as planned, his male assistant arranged for me to get to the Tribeca Grill, where Harvey would be joining us. I met a female assistant when I arrived there. I was expecting that it would be a group of us, as it had been for the reading, but she informed me it would just be Mr. Weinstein. She would sit with me until he arrived. She seemed on edge, but I could only imagine how stressful it was to work for a man who had so much going on.

Harvey arrived and the assistant immediately disappeared. We ordered drinks and starters. Again he was offended by my nonalcoholic beverage choice but he didn’t fight me on it as hard. Before the starters arrived, he announced: “Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.” I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.

I was silent for a while before I mustered up the courage to politely decline his offer. “You have no idea what you are passing up,” he said. “With all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass,” I replied.

His whole demeanor changed at that point. “Then I guess we are two ships passing in the night.” I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. “It means just that,” he said. “We are two ships going in two different directions.”

“Yes, I guess we are.”

“So we are done here,” he said. “You can leave.”

We got up, having not eaten anything, and he led me out of the restaurant. My heart was beating very fast. A cab was hailed for me. I said I would take the subway (I could not afford a cab at the time), but he handed me some money and told me not to be silly, take the cab. Before I got in, I needed to make sure that I had not awakened a beast that would go on to ruin my name and destroy my chances in the business even before I got there.

The Weinstein Investigation

“I just want to know that we are good,” I said.

“I don’t know about your career, but you’ll be fine,” he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn’t be sure.

I did not see Harvey again until September 2013 when I was in Toronto for the premiere of “12 Years a Slave,” the first feature film I was in. At an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me. He said he couldn’t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.

Not long after I won the Academy Award in 2014, I received an offer to play a role in one of the Weinstein Company’s forthcoming films. I knew I would not do it simply because it was the Weinstein Company, but I did not feel comfortable telling this to anybody. I turned down the role, but Harvey would not take no for an answer. While at Cannes, he insisted on meeting with me in person. I agreed to do it only because my agent would be present. In the meeting, he was honest about intending to persuade me to do his movie. I told him I simply did not feel it was a role I needed to play. He said he was open to making it bigger, more significant, maybe they could add a love scene. He said if I did this one for him, he would do another one for me — basically guaranteeing backing a star-vehicle film for me. I ran out of ways of politely saying no and so did my agent. I was so exasperated by the end that I just kept quiet. Harvey finally accepted my position and expressed that he still wanted to work with me at some point. “Thank you, I hope so,” I lied.

And that was the last of my personal encounters with Harvey Weinstein. I share all of this now because I know now what I did not know then. I was part of a growing community of women who were secretly dealing with harassment by Harvey Weinstein. But I also did not know that there was a world in which anybody would care about my experience with him. You see, I was entering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, “This is the way it is.” And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged. I did not know that things could change. I did not know that anybody wanted things to change. So my survival plan was to avoid Harvey and men like him at all costs, and I did not know that I had allies in this.

Fortunately for me, I have not dealt with any such incidents in the business since. And I think it is because all the projects I have been a part of have had women in positions of power, along with men who are feminists in their own right who have not abused their power. What I am most interested in now is combating the shame we go through that keeps us isolated and allows for harm to continue to be done. I wish I had known that there were women in the business I could have talked to. I wish I had known that there were ears to hear me. That justice could be served. There is clearly power in numbers. I thank the women who have spoken up and given me the strength to revisit this unfortunate moment in my past.

Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That’s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused. I hope we are in a pivotal moment where a sisterhood — and brotherhood of allies — is being formed in our industry. I hope we can form a community where a woman can speak up about abuse and not suffer another abuse by not being believed and instead being ridiculed. That’s why we don’t speak up — for fear of suffering twice, and for fear of being labeled and characterized by our moment of powerlessness. Though we may have endured powerlessness at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, by speaking up, speaking out and speaking together, we regain that power. And we hopefully ensure that this kind of rampant predatory behavior as an accepted feature of our industry dies here and now.

Now that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance.

At a sentencing, it is entirely a judge’s prerogative to prescribe a sentence within statutory guidelines. The obvious flaw with this system is bias. Judges might abuse this unchecked power to sentence based not only on relevant factors, such as the seriousness of a defendant’s offense, but also on those that are morally and constitutionally problematic — for example, gender and race.

This is precisely why states are abdicating the responsibility for sentencing to a computer. Use of a computerized risk assessment tool somewhere in the criminal justice process is widespread across the United States, and some states, such as Colorado, even require it. States trust that even if they cannot themselves unpack proprietary algorithms, computers will be less biased than even the most well-meaning humans.

But shifting the sentencing responsibility to a computer does not necessarily eliminate bias; it delegates and often compounds it.

Algorithms like COMPAS simply mimic the data with which we train them. COMPAS’s authors presumably fed historical recidivism data into their system. From that, the program ascertained what factors tend to make a defendant a higher risk. It then applied the patterns it gleaned to subsequent defendants, like Mr. Loomis, to spit out sentences that comport with existing trends.

But an algorithm that accurately reflects our world also necessarily reflects our biases. A ProPublica study found that COMPAS predicts black defendants will have higher risks of recidivism than they actually do, while white defendants are predicted to have lower rates than they actually do. (Northpointe Inc., the company that produces the algorithm, disputes this analysis.) The computer is worse than the human. It is not simply parroting back to us our own biases, it is exacerbating them.

Even if you think Mr. Loomis’s sentencing procedure arrived at the appropriate result, the potential that the process the state took to arrive there was biased — in ways neither judges nor defendants nor prosecutors know — should alarm anyone.

Machine learning algorithms often work on a feedback loop. If they are not constantly retrained, they “lean in” to the assumed correctness of their initial determinations, drifting away from both reality and fairness. As a former Silicon Valley software engineer, I saw this time and again: Google’s image classification algorithms mistakenly labeling black people as gorillas, or Microsoft’s Twitter bot immediately becoming a “racist jerk.”

Algorithms also lack the human ability to individualize. A computer cannot look a defendant in the eye, account for a troubled childhood or disability, and recommend a rehabilitative sentence. This is precisely the argument against mandatory minimum sentences — they rob judges of the discretion to deliver individualized justice — and it is equally cogent against machine sentencing.

For example, algorithms are often programmed to assume unidirectional causation: If A, then B. But is it truly that defendants with higher rates of recidivism warrant longer sentences or is it that defendants with longer sentences are kept out of their communities, unemployed and away from their families longer, naturally increasing their recidivism risk? A judge could investigate this nuance.

With transparency and accountability, algorithms in the criminal justice system do have potential for good. For example, New Jersey used a risk assessment program known as the Public Safety Assessment to reform its bail system this year, leading to a 16 percent decrease in its pre-trial jail population. The same algorithm helped Lucas County, Ohio double the number of pre-trial releases without bail, and cut pre-trial crime in half. But that program’s functioning was detailed in a published report, allowing those with subject-matter expertise to confirm that morally troubling (and constitutionally impermissible) variables — such as race, gender and variables that could proxy the two (for example, ZIP code) — were not being considered.

For now, the only people with visibility into COMPAS’s functioning are its programmers, who are in many ways less equipped than judges to deliver justice. Judges have legal training, are bound by ethical oaths, and must account for not only their decisions but also their reasoning in published opinions. Programmers lack each of these safeguards.

Computers may be intelligent, but they are not wise. Everything they know, we taught them, and we taught them our biases. They are not going to un-learn them without transparency and corrective action by humans.",When an Algorithm Helps Send You to Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/algorithm-compas-sentencing-bias.html

FRIDAY PUZZLE — People don’t believe me when I tell them that there is always a way into a puzzle, even the late week ones, but it’s true. What seems to happen is that some solvers quickly scan the list of clues on, say, a Friday puzzle,, see nothing that they know on the first pass, and decide that they can’t solve it. Many times, they give up and walk away.

But take a moment to think about this logically: What would be the point of making and editing a puzzle that no one can solve? It would be like building a house with no door or windows. It might be an interesting feat, but it’s ultimately unwelcoming. So the constructor and the editors always make sure that a porch light is left on for solvers, even if that light is in a different spot for different people.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — Jeff Chen is back with a surprisingly straightforward puzzle, which made me wonder if he was secretly taking us for a ride. His puzzles have had some pretty neat gimmicks in them, so when I see a list theme from him, my first thought is that perhaps he is pulling the old bluff on us.

Today’s Theme

It’s actually a list theme, but it’s a tight one. A total of four, two-word phrases each have a synonym for “victim” as their first word, and the CON MEN who target them are hiding away at 43D. For example, at 30A, the answer to “A mere pittance” is CHUMP CHANGE and, at 40A, the answer to the clue “Unexpected hit” is SUCKER PUNCH.

Tricky Clues

21A: A “Person setting the stage?” could be a narrator, but today it’s a ROADIE setting up for a concert.

57A: This puzzle was one of the entries in the Westchester Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and quite a few of the solvers were bamboozled by the spelling of MARK ANTONY with a ‘K.’ Many contestants thought that his name was spelled with a ‘C,’ but it’s not. And you have that easy crossing of PORKY’S to confirm.

23D: My first reaction to IBANKER was “What? No!” but it’s a thing.

37D: UNDEROOS were haute couture when The Boy was a wee one. He preferred the Batman ones.

Constructor Notes

My mother-in-law’s name is Patsy and I’m a big fan of Patsy Cline — “Walkin’ After Midnight” is one of my favorites. Not hard to see where I got the idea for the puzzle. What is hard to see is PATSY CLINE in the grid. She could have gone where PIGEON COOP is, but my mother-in-law in a crossword where PATSY is associated with CHUMP, SUCKER, and MARK ... hmm.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city.","Devastated by the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jill Freedman quit her copywriting job at a New York advertising agency and headed to Washington, D.C., to protest poverty and live among shacks and tents on the National Mall. Little more than an amateur photographer at the time, her commitment to racial and economic justice made her the only photographer who stayed and documented the entire six-week encampment known as Resurrection City.

Her striking photographs are on exhibit at Steven Kasher Gallery in New York and featured in a book, “Resurrection City, 1968,” published by Damiani with photographs and texts by Ms. Freedman and essays by John Edwin Mason and Aaron Bryant. These photographs document, and invite us to reconsider, one of the most controversial episodes in civil rights history.

Resurrection City was the centerpiece of the Poor People’s Campaign, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and, initially, by Dr. King. The campaign departed from earlier demonstrations — which had touched on economic issues but emphasized racial discrimination — to focus on jobs, education and a fair minimum wage. Its expanded platform helped attract a wide range of participants, including poor whites, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Native Americans.

It was initially conceived as a series of nonviolent demonstrations, marches, and meetings with government officials in Washington and other cities. But after the King assassination, and under the direction of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, S.C.L.C.’s new president, the campaign focused on Resurrection City, a temporary settlement built of plywood and canvas near the mall’s reflecting pool.

Construction began on May 13, 1968. Soon, several thousand people were living in a settlement that buzzed with activity. Rallies were held. Celebrities visited. Speeches were delivered. Demonstrators made daily pilgrimages to federal agencies. And Ms. Freedman photographed what she witnessed. “I knew I had to shoot the Poor People’s Campaign when they murdered Martin Luther King Jr.,” she later recalled. “I had to see what was happening, to record it and be part of it. I felt so bad.”

Gaining the trust of its residents, Ms. Freedman intimately documented life in the settlement: people congregating outside their makeshift shelters; demonstrators walking past a line of grim-faced policemen; a dapper man selling copies of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the Nation of Islam; children in rain boots frolicking in the mud; a kneeling man, his back to the camera, playing the flute; litter scattered on the marble steps of a building; and numerous portraits of residents — dignified, resolute and sometimes weary.

These photographs present a measured view of a historical event that has been more typically labeled a failure by journalists and scholars. The campaign resulted in little substantive change in federal policy. And the encampment itself was beset by problems: fragile structures endangered by intermittent rain and flooding; sanitation and health issues; petty theft; and rifts between organizers. On June 24, more than a thousand police officers cleared the encampment and evicted its remaining 500 residents.

But Ms. Freedman’s photographs affirm it was also a place of quiet defiance. These images depict solidarity among activists of all races. They reveal the dignity and courage of parents determined to provide their children with a better life. They portray a range of faces — beautiful, radiant, serious, laughing, or animated in song and protest. They remind us that, for some, the settlement provided a respite from the unremitting poverty of home. “I’m living better here than I ever did there,” was the way one resident then described it to The New York Times.

Ms. Freedman’s images underscore the vital role played by photography in the movement. Dr. King conceived the Poor People’s Campaign as a “new kind of Selma or Birmingham” — an event that might serve as a catalyst for change. He was keenly aware of the power of visual media, whether in print or on television, to spur change, commenting on several occasions about the authority of pictures to shift public opinion. His own popularity, and that of the movement he led, waning, Dr. King viewed the campaign as a way of reinvigorating support for the movement, given its broad platform of economic justice.

But the images of Resurrection City had the opposite effect. Seen in its time as a fiasco, the event was generally represented by images of desolation, filth and decay. Ms. Freedman’s photographs of Resurrection City are neither idealized nor derisive. Instead, they offer a compassionate and candid view of a historic event shrouded in myths and stereotypes.

“If you forget about things like traffic lights, dress shops, and cops, Resurrection City was pretty much just another city. Crowded. Hungry. Dirty. Gossipy. Beautiful,” Ms. Freedman wrote. “It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who’d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who’d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.”

The appointment books also include discussions related to traditional public schools, such as a telephone call in February with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.7 million public schoolteachers and other employees nationwide. Ms. DeVos then had a follow-up visit in April with Ms. Weingarten to a public school in Ohio.

But the emphasis, a review of the calendar shows, is on the same kinds of alternatives that Ms. DeVos promoted when she was a conservative philanthropist donating money to groups like Alliance for School Choice and the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which advocate school choice.

Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, said she had met with a variety of players from the world of education, including state education chiefs, superintendents, principals and teachers. He also said that Ms. DeVos has visited more public schools since she started than religious or private schools.

“Secretary DeVos is focused on ensuring all students have equal access to a great education,” he said in a written statement, adding, “She has made no secret that giving parents more options is a critical way to help improve outcomes, and America’s families have been clear in their demands for more and better choices.”

The detailed calendar entries suggest Ms. DeVos remains closely involved with some of the people helping to lead or advise leaders in the school choice movement. Among them are Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, whom Ms. DeVos was scheduled to meet on June 21 to discuss language she could use to promote school vouchers without generating as much resistance to the effort, according to the notes in her agenda.

“Frank has a 60 slide deck of the words to use and the words to lose regarding parental choice, vouchers, charter schools, teacher pay and all the other issues in education reform,” the notes say.

On July 10, Ms. DeVos met with a Republican state senator from Tennessee, Brian Kelsey, according to her calendar, to discuss the “federal government’s plans for school vouchers.” In her first weeks on the job, she also had a call with former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. The topic was listed as “School Choice in Texas.”

According to the calendar, Ms. DeVos also met with Tim Keller and Richard Komer of the Institute for Justice, a conservative nonprofit that has joined lawsuits in Montana, Nevada and additional states to defend the ability of parents to use taxpayer-funded vouchers to cover tuition for their children to attend private religious schools. The goal of the meeting: “suggest a few areas where the Department could facilitate school choice efforts and offer the Sec. help in those areas.”

Mr. Komer said he had known Ms. DeVos for a decade and was glad to see her maintain her commitment to school choice.

“We would like to see them promote parent choice and parent power to choose,” Mr. Komer said of the 30-minute meeting he had with Ms. DeVos.

Her schedule also shows various appointments with representatives from the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Christian Schools and the Christian Academy for Reaching Excellence; with the education chairman from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and with officials from other religious groups.

Ms. Weingarten, the school union president, said in an interview on Thursday that Ms. DeVos’s calendar was a case study in her priorities.

“She has very much undermined public schooling, which 90 percent of children in America attend and which is the foundation to America’s democracy,” Ms. Weingarten said.

The daily log of Ms. DeVos’s activity since February, when she was confirmed by the Senate, also shows extensive travel. Ms. DeVos has said she pays for the trips herself since she typically goes on a privately owned plane.

Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that Ms. DeVos “travels on personally owned aircraft, accompanied by her security detail and whenever possible, additional support staff” without charging the government. In addition, Ms. Hill said, Ms. DeVos also does not accept reimbursement for lodging or other travel-related costs.

An examination of Ms. DeVos’s calendar shows that she frequently leaves Washington on what appear to be long weekends, as her work calendar indicates no appointments on certain Fridays or Mondays surrounding these trips to destinations that have included Vero Beach, Fla., Aspen, Colo., and Grand Rapids, Mich. All are places where Ms. DeVos or a member of her family owns a home.

The records show that Ms. DeVos took long weekends on at least 11 occasions, meaning that her work calendar indicates no appointments on at least one workday around the weekend.

On Friday, March 3, for example, the records show that Ms. DeVos went to Aspen — where her family owns a ski-in, ski-out home in Snowmass Village — and that she did not return to the office, or have any work appointments, until Tuesday, March 7.

She then left on March 8, for Sea Island, Ga., where she attended an American Enterprise Institute World Forum, with her calendar showing that she did not return to the office for work appointments until Monday, March 13.

On Thursday, March 30, Ms. DeVos’s calendar shows that she left her office at 3 p.m. for Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington on her way to Vero Beach, where she and her husband, Dick DeVos, have a home.

Austin Evers, a State Department lawyer during the Obama administration who now serves as the executive director of a liberal nonprofit group, American Oversight, which sued the Education Department for the records and provided a copy of them to The New York Times, said Ms. DeVos’s frequent days out of the office with no appointments on her calendar amounted to “truancy.”

Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, called the analysis of Ms. DeVos’s days away from Washington with no appointments “fatally flawed.” The entries, he said, only reflect formal appointments. Ms. DeVos is routinely working, he said, even if nothing is listed on her work calendar.

“Secretary DeVos isn’t a creature of Washington and prefers to spend her time in communities across the country with America’s students, parents and educators,” Mr. Bailey said in a statement. “She travels often to make that possible, and she travels at no expense to taxpayers.”",Betsy DeVos’s Schedule Shows Focus on Religious and Nontraditional Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/betsy-devos-work-schedule-education.html

With so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.

Uber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.

“There is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,” said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Some professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.

“There are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,” Mr. Zettlemoyer said. “The salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.”

To bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach “deep learning” and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.

The basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call “a dark art.” Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.

In order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.

“I can’t compete with Google, and I don’t want to,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. “So I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.”

But the industry’s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.

Not surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won’t be alleviated for years.

Half of them seemed to be trying to describe the experience in the most unpleasant terms possible, while the other half was looking for something nice to say. The first group appeared to have the easier job. Even Jonathan Gold of The Los Angeles Times, who named Vespertine the city’s best restaurant this week, acknowledged that the experience “is going to drive many of you insane.”

Anybody inclined to paint the restaurant as a steaming pile of pretentious nonsense will find that Jordan Kahn, Vespertine’s chef and overall impresario, is standing there with an open paint bucket and a brush. Vespertine is dedicated to “exploring a dimension of cuisine that is neither rooted in tradition nor culture,” a press release read. “It is a spirit that exists between worlds.” To Marian Bull of GQ, he described the building, one of several the architect Eric Owen Moss has designed in this low-rise district of vintage studio lots and start-ups, as “a machine artifact from an extraterrestrial planet that was left here like a billion years ago by a species that were moon worshippers.”

I spent most of an evening in that building and I still have no idea what he was talking about. The servers acted less like ancient space aliens than like monks running a monastic retreat for stressed-out nonbelievers. They glided around in black slippers and flowing black tunics, quiet as ninjas. When they were not going up the staircase to the third-floor kitchen or depositing food arrangements on the acrylic tabletops with a semi-explanatory murmur (“giant kelp with whipped honey and yuzu emulsion”), they stood motionlessly off to the side, looking either at the horizon or at the wall.

When he defines the cooking as rootless, Mr. Kahn is on more solid footing. Early in his career he worked in the pastry kitchens of Per Se and Alinea, so he knows how to take pains. A great deal of the pains he takes at Vespertine seem to go into making the food look like something other than food.

That, at least, is how it struck me after one meal at this “gastronomical experiment,” as the website has it. Writing up my preliminary impressions seems more appropriate than a full starred review for a work that is explicitly, intentionally in progress, one whose aim is to do something restaurants haven’t done before. Never mind that this has been the aim of a small parade of restaurants from El Bullí on, and that Vespertine falls right in step with that parade, however much it may pretend to have sprung from a fallen spore from another galaxy.

The first dish of the night seemed to be a sequined branch on an inclined black tortilla. The tortilla was a clay plate made, like many of the serving pieces, by a local sculptor named Robert Boldz. The branch was a water spinach stem brushed with turkey emulsion and bedazzled with little yellow pike eggs, tiny finger-lime orbs, pink and purple flowers the size of shirt-collar buttons, and whatnot. I like salads flavored with poultry juices, and I liked this.

Next came what I thought of as A Wheel Inside a Wheel, a wide looping belt of kelp stuck with blots of lovage sauce to the inside of a black ceramic hoop. There was a bloop of whipped honey inside the hoop, too. I stared, looking for a way in, until a server said, “You can think of it as chips and dip.” Oh, of course.

Some courses were almost inviting. Others seemed determined not to be eaten at all, like the C-curve of black wafer pressed into a C-curve of black ceramic. It wasn’t at all clear which part was supposed to go in my mouth. I gambled on the wafer, which was a crumbly savory cookie made from black currants and dried onions and brushed with black currant jam.

It went on from there, the portions growing slightly more substantial. Nothing tasted as weird as it looked. For this I was grateful. Nearly every dish tasted good, in one way or another, although more than one juxtaposed something unquestionably delicious with other things that turned up empty-handed to the flavor party: wonderful lobster in a bittersweet sauce of malted barley syrup and butter with a dull white spill of tapioca; exceptional brined scallop, sauced with yuzu and a tea made from Douglas fir tips, with unexciting ovals of white asparagus standing up like marble headstones in a cemetery.

Mr. Kahn has strong ideas about Vespertine’s food, but in these early months his interests seem predominantly visual. Drinking the juice pairing, I was amazed to realize that each of my drinks looked like my companion’s wines or beers; the ruby tone of his pinot noir nearly matched that of my beet and rose-hip juice. Our pairings converged at one point, a tea made from flowers of the butterfly pea plant. Its flavor was flat, almost imperceptible, but its color was a profound blue almost never seen at the dinner table.

Heightened attention to visuals is routine for chefs these days, when a pretty food picture can rocket around the world in minutes. This is not Mr. Kahn’s game. Certain Vespertine dishes are virtually unphotographable by design. The caramelized lobster, for instance, is squirreled away inside a black ceramic globe. A small opening lets in almost no light.

He isn’t trying to dress up his cooking so much as he’s trying to wrestle it away from familiarity. He certainly uses flowers for their colors — none of them tasted like much — but the blossoms he chooses are not normal restaurant ingredients. Gardeners may spot sweet alyssum, passionflower and yarrow, but others probably won’t.

The urge to make food unrecognizable as food has been going strong since the rise of Ferran Adrià, whose lasting legacy is his emphasis on transforming ingredients into unfamiliar shapes and states. Some chefs who followed Mr. Adrià’s plunge into the weird, such as Grant Achatz and Wylie Dufresne, often combined flavors in ways that were immediately recognizable, even if the shapes were new. The taste of pastrami and rye at Mr. Dufresne’s WD-50, or birthday cake at Mr. Achatz’s Alinea, provided a sensory thread back to the known world.

Mr. Kahn’s innovation is to cut that thread. The rhubarb compote he serves with heirloom turkey may or may not be an analogue for cranberries, but in general he faithfully carries out his promise to uproot Vespertine’s cooking from tradition and culture. You’re not meant to know what you’re eating, which may be why the servers’ monkish murmurs cover just a fraction of what they are depositing in front of you.

This would be all right if the flavors made as strong an impression as the shapes they’d taken. But I remember the way my meal looked much more vividly than how it tasted. Mr. Kahn is letting his gifts as a sculptor and colorist, which are real, get the upper hand.

For the first two hours or so, Vespertine had me going. The music, by the Texas ambient outfit This Will Destroy You, made me slow down and listen for small shifts and surprise harmonies. (Five recordings of violas, guitars, synthesizers, xylophones and music boxes, among other instruments, play in different parts of the restaurant, composed in relative keys so they mesh together when you hear more than one at a time.) I appreciated the way the murmuring monks, instead of telling me how “Chef” wanted the food to enter my body, left me to puzzle it out on my own. And up to a point, I enjoyed solving those puzzles.

Before dinner ended, though, I’d had enough. If I hadn’t been guilted into paying $30 in advance for after-dinner drinks in the garden by an unsubtle poke from the ticketing website (“We ask that all guests participate”), I would have called for the car.

Another Adrià legacy is the idea that creativity in cooking means a sharp break with the past. Mr. Achatz picked up on this when he named his restaurant Alinea, after the medieval symbol marking a new paragraph — a new line of thought.

I have never seen a restaurant try as hard as Vespertine to erase everything that came before. While I was eating there I didn’t miss the good old earth, but I did think that Mr. Kahn’s new planet needed a few more signs of life.

Travelers who aren’t tied to a family turkey dinner this Thanksgiving may want to consider trips abroad. Hotels from Italy to Argentina to Iceland are offering savings over the long Thanksgiving weekend. Some packages even include a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with all the trimmings. Here are a few options.

At Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort and Spa, in the peaceful Serchio Valley of Italy’s Tuscany region, a Thanksgiving package includes a room with a view, daily breakfast and dinner for two for €210 per night (about $250; compared to €230 per night, without meals). A three-course Thanksgiving feast is included, with a menu of roasted turkey, cranberry sauce and mashed sweet potatoes.

Grace Cafayate, a hotel and estancia in Argentina’s Calchaquí Valley, is offering a local twist on a typical Thanksgiving celebration. A traditional Argentine asado has been reimagined as a Thanksgiving barbecue under the stars, with clay-oven baked turkey, vegetables off the parrilla, mashed potatoes and classic apple pie, all paired with local wine. The barbecue can be served on the patio of guests’ private villa or in an outdoor dining area overlooking the hotel’s vineyards. This villa package includes buffet breakfast, Thanksgiving dinner for two, and access to the hotel spa for $330, with additional nights available from $210 per night (compared to $245 per night without meals).

At Canopy by Hilton Reykjavik City Center, in Iceland, a Northern Lights package includes a 20 percent discount coupon to a Northern Lights Tour, complimentary admission to Aurora Reykjavik Northern Lights Center and scenic rooftop tastings with alcoholic drinks and light bites. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, king premium rooms are available for $479 per night.

From Nov. 23 to 30, the W Punta de Mita on Mexico’s Pacific Coast is offering a special Thanksgiving package. Book online for three nights or longer with the rate code THKSGI and receive a $100 spa credit, daily breakfast for two and a ceviche cooking lesson. The package also includes a three-course Thanksgiving dinner for two, including a turkey carving station.

The appointment books also include discussions related to traditional public schools, such as a telephone call in February with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.7 million public schoolteachers and other employees nationwide. Ms. DeVos then had a follow-up visit in April with Ms. Weingarten to a public school in Ohio.

But the emphasis, a review of the calendar shows, is on the same kinds of alternatives that Ms. DeVos promoted when she was a conservative philanthropist donating money to groups like Alliance for School Choice and the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which advocate school choice.

Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, said she had met with a variety of players from the world of education, including state education chiefs, superintendents, principals and teachers. He also said that Ms. DeVos has visited more public schools since she started than religious or private schools.

“Secretary DeVos is focused on ensuring all students have equal access to a great education,” he said in a written statement, adding, “She has made no secret that giving parents more options is a critical way to help improve outcomes, and America’s families have been clear in their demands for more and better choices.”

The detailed calendar entries suggest Ms. DeVos remains closely involved with some of the people helping to lead or advise leaders in the school choice movement. Among them are Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, whom Ms. DeVos was scheduled to meet on June 21 to discuss language she could use to promote school vouchers without generating as much resistance to the effort, according to the notes in her agenda.

“Frank has a 60 slide deck of the words to use and the words to lose regarding parental choice, vouchers, charter schools, teacher pay and all the other issues in education reform,” the notes say.

On July 10, Ms. DeVos met with a Republican state senator from Tennessee, Brian Kelsey, according to her calendar, to discuss the “federal government’s plans for school vouchers.” In her first weeks on the job, she also had a call with former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. The topic was listed as “School Choice in Texas.”

According to the calendar, Ms. DeVos also met with Tim Keller and Richard Komer of the Institute for Justice, a conservative nonprofit that has joined lawsuits in Montana, Nevada and additional states to defend the ability of parents to use taxpayer-funded vouchers to cover tuition for their children to attend private religious schools. The goal of the meeting: “suggest a few areas where the Department could facilitate school choice efforts and offer the Sec. help in those areas.”

Mr. Komer said he had known Ms. DeVos for a decade and was glad to see her maintain her commitment to school choice.

“We would like to see them promote parent choice and parent power to choose,” Mr. Komer said of the 30-minute meeting he had with Ms. DeVos.

Her schedule also shows various appointments with representatives from the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Christian Schools and the Christian Academy for Reaching Excellence; with the education chairman from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and with officials from other religious groups.

Ms. Weingarten, the school union president, said in an interview on Thursday that Ms. DeVos’s calendar was a case study in her priorities.

“She has very much undermined public schooling, which 90 percent of children in America attend and which is the foundation to America’s democracy,” Ms. Weingarten said.

The daily log of Ms. DeVos’s activity since February, when she was confirmed by the Senate, also shows extensive travel. Ms. DeVos has said she pays for the trips herself since she typically goes on a privately owned plane.

Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that Ms. DeVos “travels on personally owned aircraft, accompanied by her security detail and whenever possible, additional support staff” without charging the government. In addition, Ms. Hill said, Ms. DeVos also does not accept reimbursement for lodging or other travel-related costs.

An examination of Ms. DeVos’s calendar shows that she frequently leaves Washington on what appear to be long weekends, as her work calendar indicates no appointments on certain Fridays or Mondays surrounding these trips to destinations that have included Vero Beach, Fla., Aspen, Colo., and Grand Rapids, Mich. All are places where Ms. DeVos or a member of her family owns a home.

The records show that Ms. DeVos took long weekends on at least 11 occasions, meaning that her work calendar indicates no appointments on at least one workday around the weekend.

On Friday, March 3, for example, the records show that Ms. DeVos went to Aspen — where her family owns a ski-in, ski-out home in Snowmass Village — and that she did not return to the office, or have any work appointments, until Tuesday, March 7.

She then left on March 8, for Sea Island, Ga., where she attended an American Enterprise Institute World Forum, with her calendar showing that she did not return to the office for work appointments until Monday, March 13.

On Thursday, March 30, Ms. DeVos’s calendar shows that she left her office at 3 p.m. for Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington on her way to Vero Beach, where she and her husband, Dick DeVos, have a home.

Austin Evers, a State Department lawyer during the Obama administration who now serves as the executive director of a liberal nonprofit group, American Oversight, which sued the Education Department for the records and provided a copy of them to The New York Times, said Ms. DeVos’s frequent days out of the office with no appointments on her calendar amounted to “truancy.”

Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, called the analysis of Ms. DeVos’s days away from Washington with no appointments “fatally flawed.” The entries, he said, only reflect formal appointments. Ms. DeVos is routinely working, he said, even if nothing is listed on her work calendar.

“Secretary DeVos isn’t a creature of Washington and prefers to spend her time in communities across the country with America’s students, parents and educators,” Mr. Bailey said in a statement. “She travels often to make that possible, and she travels at no expense to taxpayers.”",Betsy DeVos’s Schedule Shows Focus on Religious and Nontraditional Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/betsy-devos-work-schedule-education.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

UPDATE The number of overdose deaths reached 64,000 people in 2016, but county data is not yet available.

Deaths from drug overdoses jumped in nearly every county across the United States, driven largely by an explosion in addiction to prescription painkillers and heroin.

Some of the largest concentrations of overdose deaths were in Appalachia and the Southwest, according to county-level estimates released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The number of these deaths reached 52,404 people in 2015, or the equivalent of about 145 Americans every day.

Deaths from overdoses are reaching levels similar to the H.I.V. epidemic at its peak.

The death rate from drug overdoses is climbing at a much faster pace than other causes of death, jumping to an average of 16 per 100,000 in 2015 from six per 100,000 in 1999.

The trend is now similar to that of the human immunodeficiency virus, or H.I.V., epidemic in the late 1980s and early 1990s, said Robert Anderson, the C.D.C.’s chief of mortality statistics.

Overdose deaths in 2015 per 100,000

4 8 12 16 20

H.I.V. deaths rose in a shorter time frame, but their peak in 1995 is similar to the high point of deaths from drug overdoses reached in 2014, Mr. Anderson said. H.I.V., however, was mainly an urban problem. Drug overdoses cut across rural-urban boundaries.

15 per 100,000 Rural areas Large metro areas 10 5 Overdose deaths 2002 2014

In fact, death rates from overdoses in rural areas now outpace the rate in large metropolitan areas, which historically had higher rates.

Heroin abuse in states like New Hampshire make it a top campaign issue.

Drugs deaths have skyrocketed in New Hampshire. In 2014, 326 people died from an overdose of an opioid, a class of drugs that includes heroin and fentanyl, a painkiller 100 times as powerful as morphine.

Nationally, opioids were involved in more than 61 percent of deaths from overdoses in 2014. Deaths from heroin overdoses have more than tripled since 2010 and are double the rate of deaths from cocaine.

In New Hampshire, which holds this year’s first presidential primary, residents have repeatedly raised the issue of heroin addiction with visiting candidates.

“No group is immune to it — it is happening in our inner cities, rural and affluent communities,” said Timothy R. Rourke, the chairman of the New Hampshire Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse.

Most of the deaths from overdose in the state are related to a version of fentanyl. “Dealers will lace heroin with it or sell pure fentanyl with the guise of being heroin,” Mr. Rourke said.

But fentanyl can be deadlier than heroin. It takes much more naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, to revive someone who has overdosed on fentanyl.

Mr. Rourke said that high death rates in New Hampshire were symptomatic of a larger problem: The state is second to last, ahead of only Texas, in access to treatment programs. New Hampshire spends $8 per capita on treatment for substance abuse. Connecticut, for example, spends twice that amount.

Workplace injuries may drive rising addiction in Appalachia.

Appalachia has been stricken with overdose deaths for more than a decade, in many ways because of prescription drug addiction among its workers.

West Virginia and neighboring states have many blue-collar workers, and “in that group, there’s just a lot of injuries,” said Dr. Carl R. Sullivan III, the director of addiction services at the West Virginia University School of Medicine.

“In the mid-1990s, there was a social movement that said it was unacceptable for patients to have chronic pain, and the pharmaceutical industry pushed the notion that opioids were safe,” he said.

A few years ago, as laws were passed to address the misuse of prescription painkillers, addicts began turning to heroin instead, he said. Because of a lack of workers needed to treat addicts, overdose deaths have continued to afflict states like West Virginia, which has the highest overdose death rate in the nation.

“Chances of getting treatment in West Virginia is ridiculously small,” Dr. Sullivan said. “We’ve had this uptick in overdose deaths despite enormous public interest in this whole issue.”

In New Mexico, drug addiction is being passed to the next generation.

While New Mexico has avoided the national spotlight in the current wave of opioid addiction, it has had high death rates from heroin overdoses since the early 1990s.

Heroin addiction has been “passed down from generation to generation in small cities around New Mexico,” said Jennifer Weiss-Burke, executive director of Healing Addiction in Our Community, a nonprofit group formed to curb heroin addiction. “I've heard stories of grandparents who have been heroin users for years, and it is passed down to younger generations; it’s almost like a way of life.”

Dr. Michael Landen, the state epidemiologist, said the state recently began grappling with prescription opioids. Addictions have shifted to younger people and to more affluent communities.

Ms. Weiss-Burke, whose son died from a heroin overdose in 2011, said it was much harder to treat young people. “Some young people are still having fun and they don’t have the desire to get sober, so they end up cycling through treatment or end up in jail,” she said.

They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.
Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.
Still, she says, “I think it is a very good idea for the sake of the brain to be moving and active.”","Last year, in an important study published in NeuroImage, the researchers found for the first time that young brain cells in adult mice that spent a month with running wheels in their cages did seem to be different from those in animals that did not run. For the experiment, the scientists injected a modified rabies vaccine into the animals, where it entered the nervous system and brain. They then tracked and labeled connections between brain cells and learned that compared to the sedentary animals’ brain cells, the runners’ newborn neurons had more and longer dendrites, the snaky tendrils that help to connect the cells into the neural communications network. They also found that more of these connections led to portions of the brain that are important for spatial memory, which is our internal map of where we have been and how we got there.

This type of memory is often diminished in the early stages of dementia.

But these findings, while intriguing, involved animals that had been running for a month, which is the equivalent of years of physical activity by people. The researchers wondered whether such changes in neurons and connections might actually begin earlier and maybe almost immediately after the animals began to exercise.

So for the new study, which was published last month in Scientific Reports, most of the same researchers gathered a group of adult, male mice. (Males were used to avoid accounting for the effects of the female reproductive cycle.) The animals were injected with a substance that marks newborn neurons. Half were then allowed to run for a week on wheels in their cages, while the others remained inactive. Afterward, some were also injected with the modified rabies vaccine to track new synapses and connections between the neurons.

When the scientists then microscopically examined brain tissue, they found that the runners’ brains, as expected, teemed with far more new neurons than did the brains of the sedentary animals, even though the runners had been exercising for only a week.

Interestingly, these neurons also looked unique. They were larger and, as in the study of mice that ran for a month, displayed more and longer dendrites than similar neurons in the other animals. In effect, the young neurons in the runners’ brains appeared to be more mature after only a week of exercise than brain cells from inactive animals.

These young cells were better integrated into the overall brain circuitry, too, with more connections into portions of the brain involved in spatial and other types of memory. Most surprising to the scientists, these cells also proved to be less easily activated by neurochemical messages to fire rapidly, which is usually a hallmark of more mature neurons. They remained calmer and less prone to excitability than new neurons in the inactive animals’ brains.

What these differences in cell structure and connection mean for brain function remains uncertain, though, says Henriette van Praag, a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health and senior author of this and the earlier study. Neither study was designed to look into whether the running mice thought and remembered differently than mice that were sedentary for most of the day.

But the current study “provides more pieces of evidence that brain cells produced under running conditions are not just quantitatively but qualitatively different” than other neurons, she says, “and these differences are evident very soon” after exercise begins.

Perhaps most important, the new brain cells in the runners tended to integrate into and bulk up portions of the brain that, if damaged by disease, are associated with early memory loss and dementia, she adds.

Of course, this experiment used mice, which are not people. While some past neurological studies with people have hinted that exercise might alter our brain structure in similar ways, she says, that possibility is still theoretical.

House Republicans, over Mr. Trump’s public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year.
A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts.
In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings.
But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.","Democrats were swift to criticize the approach, saying it was an attempt to hide tax changes that will hurt, not help, middle-class families. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the bill was shaping up to be “a bunch of false promises to the middle class.” Republicans, he said, “know the details — the specifics of what they’re really about — will be hard to argue in the sunlight.”

Lawmakers and committee staff members must still resolve some of the thorniest issues before they can release a bill, including where to draw income lines for tax brackets, how high to set the top personal income tax rate and how to ensure that major changes to the way that multinational corporations are taxed do not encourage them to shift more money overseas. The biggest question is how to offset enough tax revenue that will be lost from cutting rates to remain within the rules of the Senate budget reconciliation process, which allows Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster.

The budget measure approved on Thursday would allow for a tax bill that adds as much as $1.5 trillion to federal deficits over a decade, at a time when the federal government’s debt has already topped $20 trillion. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

The outline of the tax plan unveiled in September would cut the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent; collapse individual income tax brackets from seven to three or four, with tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, and possibly one higher; and nearly double the standard deduction, to $12,000 for individuals and to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly.

The budget measure passed over the loud protests of House members from New York and New Jersey, who worry that the blueprint will doom the current deduction for state and local taxes — a benefit of great importance to taxpayers in their states. Eleven of the 20 Republicans who voted no were from those two states.

“This isn’t over,” one of those lawmakers, Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, a Republican, said after the vote. “I am confident we’ll reach an agreement. And if we don’t, then I don’t see how we can move forward.”

Mr. Brady told reporters later in the day that while no such agreement had yet been reached, it would eventually be resolved, since families in New York and New Jersey needed to be “better off” after a tax bill passes.

“This is a serious issue, and we’re taking it seriously,” Mr. Brady said. Republican lawmakers from those states “made it clear they need this problem solved before they vote yes on tax reform,” he added.

Democrats were quick to seize on the discord. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin had put his party’s control of the House at even greater risk through his “foolish decision to force his most vulnerable members to walk the plank on a toxic tax increase.”

“Anybody who votes for this thing should have their head examined if they live where we do,” said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York.

In addition to the dispute over the deduction for state and local taxes, President Trump and Mr. Brady have collided over the issue of retirement savings, another delicate matter.

House Republicans, over Mr. Trump’s public objections, are considering changes to the tax treatment of retirement accounts, including potentially lowering the pretax amounts that Americans may contribute to their 401(k) accounts each year. On Thursday, Mr. Brady hinted that the bill may raise the limit on the total amount Americans can save in tax-preferred accounts but shift the tax preference to the back end, so that a larger share of those contributions are taxed up front, instead of when they are withdrawn, as is the case with 401(k) plans.

Such a change would produce more tax revenues in the short term, at the expense of the long run, which would help Republicans make their tax math work. One possible reason to consider that change would be to offset revenues lost from a deal to preserve some of the state and local deduction for individuals.

A budget blueprint passed by the House earlier this month called for a more aggressive approach on deficits and spending cuts. In addition to laying the groundwork for a tax bill, the House’s plan would have instructed committees to come up with at least about $200 billion in savings. The House’s plan also called for a tax overhaul that would not add to the deficit. But the House ultimately agreed to approve the Senate version of the budget to speed the tax overhaul effort.

House Republicans were “asked to vote for a budget that nobody believes in so that we have the chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read,” Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, complained this week.

Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee and the chairwoman of the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that taking up the Senate plan was not an ideal outcome, but she talked up the promise of overhauling taxes.

“President Trump is with us on this, and I agree that we must move quickly,” she said.

And while Republicans expressed cautious optimism that they could resolve their differences, avoid lobbying pitfalls and deliver the bill to Mr. Trump for his signature in December, Democrats warned that the ride could be rough.

“It’s easy to understand why they want to rush a bill like this through, because the more people see it, the less they’ll like it,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat. “It’ll be a lot tougher for them to get it done than they think.”","House Passes Budget Blueprint, Clearing Path for Tax Overhaul",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/house-budget-blueprint-tax-cut.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.
“They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said.","The hospital, a cardiology institute in Abkhazia, shut down when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. The following year, war made it a refuge. From 1992 to 1993, Russian-backed Abkhaz rebels pushed out Georgian troops in a proxy war, several dozen people squatted there, like countless others who were forced to flee their homes on the Black Sea’s east coast.

This was supposed to be temporary, of course. Instead, 25 years later, as Alexandra Rose Howland documents, life in limbo has become indefinite.

Ms. Howland, 27-year-old British-American artist and photographer based in Istanbul, found 43 families living at the hospital, casualties of war largely forgotten or ignored by society. Children had been born there, grown up and started their own families.

As Ms. Howland discovered, apartments have been created with pooled resources — both money and muscle. A society has emerged: the men who gather in the courtyard to drink and gossip in the afternoons, the kids who run around the grounds together, the women and their coffee klatches.

And yet, their normal is not normal.

Few have full-time jobs, prospects or hope for a brighter future, Ms. Howland said. Children tend to drop out of school to work or, for girls, marry young. They live very much as do refugees all over the world, ignored, even resented. Few dare to dream of careers, higher education, or a better life.

They are not alone in this predicament. The United Nations has documented millions of “Internally displaced persons,” or I.D.P.s, refugees in their own lands, languishing in limbo after leaving their homes during conflicts. The U.N. Human Rights Commission has blamed a lack of political will and lack of public awareness for the protracted situations.

More than 220,000 people fled Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993, settling in empty buildings throughout Tbilisi, losing everything they owned in the process. A quarter century later, an estimated 45,000 have made it back home, Ms. Howland said.

To be sure, her project not only reveals the plight of the displaced Abkhazians, but also their pluck.

“There is a very strong sense of community, of family,” Ms. Howland said. “They each support each other, emotionally and financially, all the kids are friends, the families take care of everyone, the new mothers will each breast-feed each other’s babies. It is very much based on the communal support.” She recalled how one day, “They went for a beach trip where about 15 kids and three adults piled into a car and took off for the day.”

And yet, there is a kind of pariah quality to their lives. “They are very much isolated from the rest of society,” Ms. Howland said. “All of the surrounding buildings are also filled with IDPs.”

Ms. Howland, who studied painting and international relations at U.S.C., has made exposing the plight of homeland refugees, I.D.P.s, a long-term goal. She moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul two years ago, she said, to be more centrally located to conflict zones. “I wanted to be in the most central location I could find,” she said, “so that access to the Middle East, Balkans, Europe and Africa was all within a relatively short distance.”

Her images of family life at the hospital, taken with a digital camera or a smartphone, are the first of what she hopes will be a long-term project.

“I have encountered the same stories in each country I’ve traveled to,” she said. “I hope to continue to expand and bring attention to these forgotten communities and to the long-term impact prolonged displacement has on a population. The U.N.H.R.C. states that as of June 2017 we have an unprecedented 65.6 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and 22.5 million refugees.

“Despite these overwhelming numbers, we have yet to determine an effective method for humanely protecting and providing for them, and as soon as they are out of the public eye, they are left to survive on their own. These communities are deeply isolated and have disappeared into the fabric of our societies.”

They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.
“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.
“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said.
So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty?","Along with other frailty measures, that meant that “surgery is not going to go very well,” Dr. Robinson said. In a frank half-hour conversation, he explained to his patient that he faced a 30 to 40 percent risk of dying from the surgery. If he survived, he probably would endure a long, difficult recovery and might not regain the functional abilities he had now.

Dilemmas like these will grow more common as the population ages. Already, more than a third of inpatient surgical procedures are performed on patients over age 65.

But about 15 percent of the older population, excluding nursing home residents, meets the criteria for frailty, rising to more than a third of those over age 85. “There’s a much higher prevalence in the Deep South and among African Americans,” said Dr. Jeremy Walston, principal investigator at the Older Americans Independence Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Geriatricians like Dr. Walston have been publishing research on frailty for nearly 20 years, as measured by tools developed at Johns Hopkins or by a Canadian group, and variants thereof. The Hopkins approach uses tests like grip strength and walking speed; the Canadian index relies on health deficits, including chronic illnesses and dementia.

Both assessments do a good job of identifying patients vulnerable to health problems, regardless of chronological age. A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement.

In the United States, though, “it’s the surgeons who have picked up the banner,” Dr. Walston said. They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients.

You can see why: Frailty involves decreased physiological reserve, which helps determine how patients respond to physical stress.

Surgery brings plenty of that, said Dr. Carolyn Seib, a general and endocrine surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. The effects of anesthesia and inflammation, the risk of blood clots or infection, muscle weakness caused by days in bed — all can take a toll.

“The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,” Dr. Seib said.

Researchers have shown that after major operations — including cardiac and colon cancer surgery and kidney transplants — frail older patients are more prone than others to longer hospital stays, being readmitted within a month of a procedure and winding up in nursing homes after they’re discharged.

They’re also more likely to die.

But a study that Dr. Seib and her colleagues published in JAMA Surgery this month shows that frail seniors face higher complications even after ambulatory surgery, outpatient procedures often considered routine.

Hernia repairs, thyroid or parathyroid surgery, operations for breast cancer — “patients and providers often don’t think twice about these,” Dr. Seib said.

Yet when the researchers looked at 141,000 patients over age 40 in a national surgical database, they found that serious complications were two to four times higher in patients with moderate to high frailty, although complication rates overall were low (1.7 percent, with .7 percent experiencing serious complications).

“We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,” Dr. Seib said. Although surgeons increasingly screen for frailty, “I wouldn’t say it’s routine yet,” she added.

So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty? Should we do an assessment that indicates how frail she might be?

Unlike some conditions, frailty is something patients and doctors can actually do something about. “There are interventions that can improve or even resolve it,” said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and a pioneer in frailty research.

First, many surgical centers offer a “prehabilitation” program, shown to improve patients’ results through exercise, better nutrition and smoking cessation. Undertaken even for a few weeks before an operation, “it improves your bounce-back capability,” Dr. Fried said.

Physical activity, in particular, “seems to be the key to preventing frailty and its progression,” Dr. Fried added — even for those not contemplating surgery.

Second, surgical decision-making is not a binary choice between patients agreeing to the standard operation or doing nothing. Alerted to frailty, a surgeon might opt for a less aggressive approach or a different kind of anesthesia. A patient, understanding that she may be looking at an altered future even if the surgery fixes the physical problem, will have her own priorities to weigh.

With frailty, “I’m going to counsel the patient differently,” Dr. Robinson said. “Maybe change the surgery I do. Maybe find an alternative. There’s a spectrum of possibilities.”

Take his patient with gallstone disease.

After their discussion, the man decided that instead of undergoing what would be, for him, a high-risk operation, he would go home and try to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms. If the pain flared again, Dr. Robinson would insert a tube through his skin to drain the gallbladder, a much safer procedure.

Because the tube, and the bag into which it drained, would be permanent, it might not represent a welcome alternative for a healthier patient. But “for a physiologically vulnerable older adult,” Dr. Robinson said, “it’s a whole different equation.”",One Last Question Before the Operation: Just How Frail Are You?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/health/elderly-surgery-frailty.html

It seemed like there was more to this narrative. I decided to learn as many as possible of the stories of the girls who had been sent on suicide missions and then found a way out. I interviewed 18 of them for Thursday’s article, with photos of the girls by Adam Ferguson.

My amazing fixer and I consulted aid workers and security forces, who helped us locate the girls during two separate reporting trips to Maiduguri. Finding a safe place to interview and photograph them would be a challenge regardless of the topic. Maiduguri is a bustling city — full of teahouses, meat stalls and busy people going about their day — that feels a lot safer than it probably is. And foreign journalists draw a lot of attention.

We were at risk, but we were especially worried about the girls. If Boko Haram found out these girls had failed to detonate their bombs, they could possibly be killed. And if regular people discovered they had spent time with Boko Haram, even as hostages, they could be stigmatized as sympathizers. We settled on a quiet park, a hotel room, an empty restaurant.

Adam’s job was particularly difficult. Imagine being tasked with taking portraits of girls whose faces, we felt, should not be shown?

The girls did not request anonymity, but based on the advice of our local fixer, we obscured their faces and did not use their full names. The girls seemed relieved to have the chance to tell their stories.

I knew from my experience reporting on the insurgency that these girls had been through a string of horrible circumstances, beginning with their capture. Some had family members killed before their eyes. Fighters stuck one girl in a room with corpses, and when militants asked about her strength, she presumed they wanted her to clear the bodies. But they wanted her to carry a bomb.

Far from willing participants, each girl said that the armed militants had forcibly tied the bombs to them — many times after they had refused to have sex with their captors.

I tried to get the girls to explain their suicide missions. “What happened when Boko Haram told you to carry a bomb?” I asked. Their stories flowed.

Every one of the 18 had a narrative worthy of a dissertation on the horrors of war. Some of the girls cried as they recalled their terror. Some told their stories in squeaky voices that revealed their young age. Others were fierce, proud of how they had saved lives by not carrying out their missions.

As a reporter, my job isn’t to take sides. But I couldn’t stop myself from believing these girls were heroes. Think of the lives they saved by not detonating a hidden bomb at a crowded marketplace or manned checkpoint as they had been ordered to do.

I asked the Nigerian military whether bomber girls who surrender themselves are rewarded. Why not give them cash? Why not offer scholarships?

A military spokesman said girls who surrender their bombs are celebrated. But that wasn’t the case for any of the girls with whom I talked. After they surrendered, each had been detained, some for months, while officials tried to determine whether they were loyal to Boko Haram. I asked each girl at the end of her interview what she wanted to be when she grew up. They were still mostly children, after all, and I thought that ending with a question that focused them on the future might leave them with a sense of hope. One of the girls told me she was desperate to go back to school; the war had interrupted her education. Eventually, she wants to become a lawyer. “I want to fight for people’s rights,” she said.","18 Escaped Girls, 18 Interviews",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/insider/boko-haram-suicide-bombers.html

Also, to the extent that the story makes any sense at all, it’s a story about the very long run. In the short run, drawing in foreign money by cutting taxes on profits would lead to a stronger dollar, which would slow the pace of foreign investment by making U.S. assets look expensive.

Oh, and the stronger dollar would also mean much bigger trade deficits — a consequence of tax cuts that Republicans, strange to say, haven’t advertised, even though the same thing happened during the Reagan years.

Realistically, then, the benefits from cutting corporate taxes would overwhelmingly flow into after-tax profits rather than wages, especially in the first few years and probably for a decade or more. And this in turn means that the main beneficiaries would be stockholders, not workers.

So who are these stockholders, exactly? You can guess part of the answer: We’re talking mainly about the very affluent. Even if we count indirect holdings in retirement accounts and mutual funds, the richest 10 percent of U.S. residents account for about 80 percent of American-owned stocks, and the richest 1 percent own about 40 percent. So we’re talking, as always when it comes to Republican plans, about tax cuts heavily tilted toward the wealthy.

But that’s not the whole story, either — it gets worse.

The whole sales pitch for the Trump tax plan rests on the claim that everything is different because we’re now part of a global financial market. The truth is that this makes less difference than many imagine.

But one thing is true: These days there’s a lot of cross-border investment. In particular, as Steven M. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center notes — in a paper I found revelatory — around 35 percent of U.S. equities are now owned by foreigners, triple the level during the Reagan years.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

What this means is that around 35 percent of a tax cut from an administration that proudly uses the slogan “America first” — $700 billion over the next decade — wouldn’t even go to Americans. Instead, it would be a windfall to wealthy foreigners, who would probably gain a lot more from the tax cut than U.S. workers. Oh, and it makes all that talk about allies not paying their “fair share” sound kind of silly, doesn’t it?

And meanwhile, the result would be a huge hole in the budget, which Republicans would try to close at the expense of the poor and middle class. The budget resolution the House and Senate passed over the last week called for cuts of $1 trillion in Medicaid and almost half a trillion in Medicare. The resolution doesn’t have the force of law, but it’s a pretty clear indication of what’s next if the big tax cuts pass.

[ Read our refresher on where “Stranger Things” Season 1 left off. ]","The new season, arriving Friday, picks up just before Halloween 1984, and it spends its first half creating new versions of the first season’s conflicts. Will is back in our world, but tormented by visions of the Upside Down, which, as the first-season epilogue suggested, still has a hold on him.

Eleven, who went missing at the end of Season 1, is still in hiding. So Will’s D&D buddies — Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) — find a new cool girl to be group-infatuated with, Max (Sadie Sink), and a new creepy-crawly menace to battle. As a new extradimensional threat arises, Mr. Modine’s conspiracist scientist is replaced by Dr. Owens (a credibly straight-faced Paul Reiser).

The new season’s biggest strength is how it deals with Will’s trauma. He’s a frail kid who’s survived a horrifying experience, and Noah Schnapp, in a bigger role, doesn’t let you forget it. His lingering feeling of being unsafe in his own body is the show’s most effective chiller. Ms. Ryder’s role gets a little smaller as the story expands, but her fear of losing her son again, this time before her eyes, is just as convincing.

For a breakout hit, “Stranger Things 2” mostly refrains from milking fan-favorite elements. The death of Barb (Shannon Purser), who became a viral obsession, has continued repercussions (which occupy the show’s teen characters for much of the season), but they’re grounded in the story and characters.

And while keeping Eleven separate from the action may be frustrating, credit the Duffers for resisting the temptation to turn the series, on the strength of Ms. Brown’s transfixing stare, into “The Eleven Show.”

“Stranger Things” has a solid ensemble (Sean Astin joins it, as Joyce’s amiably clueless new boyfriend), but its real star is the world it creates. Hawkins, Ind., feels genuine even though it’s made out of movies. Parts of the new season recall “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Gremlins,” “The Empire Strikes Back” and, naturally, the Reese’s Pieces sequence in “E.T.” For one unfortunate episode, the show becomes “The Outsiders,” complete with apocalypse-chic street-punk gang.

When the boys agree to go as the Ghostbusters for Halloween, there’s even a sly comment on the racial dynamic of that movie and of ’80s pop culture. Lucas, who is African-American, refuses to go as Winston, the black Ghostbuster. “No one wants to be Winston!” he says. “He joined the team super late, he’s not funny and he’s not even a scientist.”

The new season jokes about its own referentiality later, when Lucas fills Max in on the adventures of a year ago. She, of course, thinks he’s made up a story. “I really liked it,” she says. “I just felt it was a little derivative in parts.”

That would be a fair critique of “Stranger Things 2,” which reprises many of Season 1’s arcs and twists. (The ingenious device of having Will speak from the Upside Down via Christmas lights is replaced by — well, you’ll see.) I’m not sure “Stranger Things” creatively needed a second season, and for several episodes it seems like “Stranger Things 2” isn’t convinced of it either.

But it’s a still a good time, it’s nicely paced at nine episodes and it blends the suspense of ’80s horror with the heart of an ’80s teen romance. It may be last year’s Halloween candy, repackaged. That doesn’t mean it can’t still be sweet.

“The Rooster Bar” is written with the same verve Grisham brought to this summer’s “Camino Island”; with the same sense that this reliable best-selling author is feeling real pleasure, and not just obligation, in delivering his work.

The monstrousness of what he discovers drives him out of his mind.

Always helpful to his readers, Grisham lays out the basics simply, including this list: “(1) FBLS was a subpar law school that (2) made too many promises, and (3) charged too much money, and (4) encouraged too much debt while (5) admitting a lot of mediocre students who really had no business in law school, and (6) were either not properly prepared for the bar exam or (7) too dumb to pass it.”

Once Mark, Todd and Zola have figured this out, they realize that completing their studies is a waste of money and time. So they come up with a rebellious idea: Why not start behaving like lawyers before graduation? They’ve seen low-level members of the profession hanging around courthouses trying to drum up business; nobody ever asks for proof that these hustlers have passed the bar. So Mark and Todd begin doing that, while Zola gets the ambulance-chasing beat. The Rooster Bar of the title is their local watering hole, above which they keep an apartment/office to use as an address on business cards for their completely bogus firm.

It all goes swimmingly — for a while. Grisham writes in such an inventive spirit that he even includes the three characters’ correspondence with the agents assigned to service their school loans.

(“The last thing I want to talk about is repayment. Thanks for your patience. Your friend, Mark.”) Todd plays it nasty. (“I can make more money tending bar than you can harassing students.”) Zola plays it polite, and has truly extenuating circumstances with which to deal: Her Senegalese parents, who have been American citizens for more than two decades, are about to be deported. Even so, the lenders’ nagging never ends.

About two-thirds of the way through this buoyant, mischievous thriller, the rogue students’ own scamming starts to falter. They’re in over their heads. They’ve gone to a terrible school, and their legal training hasn’t prepped them for much. They know they’re committing a few little felonies but don’t quite grasp the magnitude of the trouble they’re in. Their gamesmanship skills have to shoot sky-high as they try to stay one step ahead of the forces aligned to nail them.

“The Rooster Bar” is written with the same verve Grisham brought to this summer’s “Camino Island”; with the same sense that this reliable best-selling author is feeling real pleasure, and not just obligation, in delivering his work. He seems genuinely to like this book’s main characters, even if the two men sound very similar and could be mistaken for young boys if it weren’t for their perfunctory sexual encounters — with the same woman, Hadley, an ace prosecutor who’s young, single and competing with her roommate over how many guys each can sleep with.

As in all of Grisham’s best books, the reader of “The Rooster Bar” gets good company, a vigorous runaround and — unlike those poor benighted suckers at Foggy Bottom — a bit of a legal education.",John Grisham Prosecutes For-Profit Law Schools in ‘The Rooster Bar’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/books/review-john-grisham-rooster-bar.html

For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.
Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything.
But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.","Thanks in part to the endorsements, in just a few weeks Centra’s founders raised over $30 million from investors around the world. They finished their fund-raising this month, just before a grand jury indicted two of the three co-founders on perjury charges stemming from a drunken-driving case.

Centra was one of the 270 or so I.C.O.s that have raised more than $3.2 billion this year, a 3,000 percent jump from last year’s total, according to data from Tokendata.io, which tracks coin offerings. Investors have been willing to pay real money for these virtual tokens because they hope their value will go up as fast as the price of Bitcoin, the best-known digital currency, has in recent months.

Celebrities have helped stoke the I.C.O. boom. The actor Jamie Foxx, the socialite Paris Hilton and the soccer player Luis Suarez, for example, have all promoted new virtual currencies to their sizable followings on social media in recent months, offering legitimacy and attention to coin offerings that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Mr. Mayweather, who has promoted three different tokens — Centra, Stox and Hubiits — has even taken to calling himself Crypto Mayweather in social media posts, a play on his better-known nickname, Money Mayweather.

But the story of Centra illustrates that beneath the signs of mainstream acceptance, coin offerings still exist in a legal gray zone with few checks on the ambitions of young entrepreneurs.

“It’s undeniable that a celebrity endorsement brings a new audience into the world of crypto currencies,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a nonprofit that advocates for Bitcoin and related technology. “But I’m not certain that celebrity endorsements are doing a good job of bringing attention to the legitimate projects. I worry they are bringing attention to the scams.”

Coins of the Digital Wild West

The original virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a digital token — with no physical backing — that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. The network on which Bitcoin is stored and transferred was designed to operate without any company or government in charge, governed by a far-flung collaboration of volunteer programmers and computers that maintain all the records.

Initial coin offerings have taken advantage of the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and another popular virtual currency network, Ethereum. People can pay for tokens like Centra using Bitcoin and Ether (the currency inside Ethereum), and no financial authority needs to approve the payments or even know they happened.

Coin offerings have also copied the decentralized structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are riding on the coattails of tech industry enthusiasm for those currency systems. The Centra founders said their token would fuel a new virtual currency debit card and online market. Some venture capitalists have said these new tokens could provide a way to fund and support new global networks — like the next generation of the internet.

But while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gone through years of public vetting (and still have plenty of critics), the new tokens being sold in recent months are unproven, and marketed on the promises of their creators.

The creators of Centra are 26-year-old friends from southern Florida, Sam Sharma and Raymond Trapani. The company’s chief marketing officer, Robert Farkas, was recently given the title of co-founder as well. Before Centra, neither Mr. Sharma nor Mr. Trapani had any professional experience with the technologies associated with virtual currencies, or with the debit cards they were hoping to build.

The primary business experience of Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas was at Miami Exotics, a luxury car rental business that the two built. Mr. Trapani’s old Instagram account shows that he was also a credit repair specialist with a penchant for pictures of luxury cars and stacks of $20 bills.

“You can sit and watch my life, or you can join my team and live a life like mine!” he wrote in one post.

The lack of experience in the virtual currency industry did nothing to limit the ambitions of Centra’s founders. In July, they put out a website and an announcement that described Centra as an answer to the proliferation of virtual currencies.

“Centra Tech has a brilliant solution, the world’s first Debit Card that is designed for use with compatibility on 8+ major cryptocurrencies blockchain assets,” the announcement said.

Making up for the inexperience of the young men was an older chief executive named Michael Edwards, at least according to the Centra website at the time.

The first cracks in the project appeared in early August when a programmer, Harry Denly, wrote on his blog that Mr. Edwards appeared to be made up. The photo on Centra’s website was a photo of a Canadian physiology professor who had no relation to Centra — and none of the details on Mr. Edward’s LinkedIn profile, like his work experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, checked out.

Centra initially threatened to sue Mr. Denly but then said the bad profiles were the result of freelancers who had hastily put together the company’s marketing material. The LinkedIn profile was deleted.

The company has since removed any mention of Michael Edwards from the Centra site and elevated Mr. Sharma to be president. The company also deleted several other employees whose identity and existence were challenged on social media forums.

“When I got involved, the website got cleaned up from A to Z,” Mr. Sharma said in an interview.

Centra charged past these hiccups and began its token sale, got its endorsement from Mr. Mayweather (more on that later) and moved ahead with its plans for a virtual currency debit card. The debit card was described as a new product that would make it possible to spend virtual currencies anywhere Visa cards were taken. The company’s site showed Centra cards emblazoned with the Visa logo.

There was one problem with this plan. The company had not been approved, or had even applied, to run a Centra card on the Visa network, a spokeswoman for Visa said.

After The New York Times reached out to Visa this month, Centra took all the mentions of Visa off its website. Mr. Sharma then said in an interview that the company had shifted its strategy and was now planning to run its cards on the Mastercard network in partnership with a Canadian financial institution. He said this would not require approval from Mastercard because the Canadian institution would issue the cards.

But a Mastercard spokesman, Brian Gendron, disagreed.

“Centra would need approval from Mastercard for something like that, and we are not aware of any approval that has been sought or achieved,” Mr. Gendron said.

Because Centra began raising money without going through any standard background checks, no one verified the company’s credentials with the credit card networks or other relevant authorities. A basic background check would have turned up the numerous run-ins with the law that Mr. Sharma, the company president, has had.

Mr. Sharma has been sued in Florida and New York several times on allegations of unpaid bills and business deals gone sour. Twice, people have accused him in court of trying to fraudulently sell or lend them cars that he didn’t own, and twice he has been evicted for claims that he failed to pay rent.

The landlord in Boca Raton, Fla. who evicted him, Steven Fern, said that after Mr. Sharma stopped paying the rent on his condominium, Mr. Sharma promised repeatedly that he would make it up the next month.

“He stayed the entire time, literally until the day the police came,” Mr. Fern said. “It was a strange scenario, and we lost a lot of money.”

Mr. Sharma said that these problems, a few years ago, had happened when he was “a kid.”

He said the landlord’s statements were “not accurate.”

Sprite, Pinot Grigio and a White Maserati

For now, the bigger problem facing Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani is the perjury indictment by a Manhattan grand jury on Oct. 5, just a few days after Centra finished fund-raising.

The charges stem from an incident last year in Manhattan, when Mr. Sharma was arrested early on a Friday in a white Maserati. According to a local news report, Mr. Sharma ran a stop sign and had “a flushed face, a strong odor of alcohol on his breath and watery and bloodshot eyes, and was unsteady on his feet.”

Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani both said during Mr. Sharma’s trial that on the night in question, Mr. Sharma had only had Sprite and one glass of pinot grigio, according to the indictment.

“As defendant Sharma and defendant Trapani knew, the testimony that defendant Trapani gave was false, and the truth was that on March 24, 2016, there were alcoholic beverages other than pinot grigio on the table and the defendant did not order Sprite,” the indictment said.

Mr. Sharma said that he couldn’t speak to the case because it was still going on, but that it should not have any effect on Centra.

“I’m obviously not comfortable with that situation,” he said. “But it’s not that I did something so intensely crazy that investors need to worry.”

He and Mr. Trapani both said they were moving ahead with their big plans for Centra, including more projects with Mr. Mayweather.

Mr. Trapani said the company was connected with Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled through social contacts in Miami. Mr. Trapani said Mr. Mayweather was so intrigued by Centra’s technology that he wanted to be paid in Centra tokens, and wanted to be a partner for future business ventures.

“He’ll do anything we ask,” Mr. Trapani said. “He’ll go shopping around Beverly Hills if we ask him to do it with this card.”

The boxing champ understood their deal differently. A spokeswoman for Mr. Mayweather, Kelly Swanson, said he had been paid in cash for the posts and was not involved in any continuing relationship with Centra. She did not say how much he had been paid.

After being contacted by The Times, Mr. Mayweather deleted his Instagram and Facebook posts endorsing Centra, though he left up a Twitter post.

Mr. Sharma disputed the account of Mr. Mayweather’s spokeswoman and said the boxer had received Centra tokens. “We dealt with Floyd directly through my guy,” Mr. Sharma said. “It was a very direct, individual deal.”

Representatives for DJ Khaled did not respond to requests for comment.

Other celebrities have already learned the risks of associating with initial coin offerings.

In September, Ms. Hilton endorsed a token known as Lydian Coin on Twitter, where she wrote: “Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token!” Ms. Hilton deleted the post after Forbes reporters uncovered the checkered legal past of the founder of Lydian Coin, who had aimed to raise $100 million.

Regulators have been relatively slow to crack down on problematic coin offerings. But the Securities and Exchange Commission did recently bring its first case against what it claimed was a fraudulent project — a relatively small one that collected a few hundred thousand dollars.

For now, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Trapani are sitting on the $30 million that investors gave them.

Mr. Sharma shared and proved his ownership of the Ethereum wallet where they are currently keeping the money.

Assuming regulators don’t step in, Mr. Trapani and Mr. Sharma can keep the money, even if they don’t build anything. But they say that won’t happen.

Mr. Sharma said Centra was planning to issue its first batch of debit cards this year, regardless of the denials of Visa and Mastercard, and would unveil its broader technology in November. They have already rented lavish offices in Miami Beach and hired several people.

“I see us taking over as being the No. 1 company that people will use to use their crypto assets,” Mr. Sharma said, using an industry term for virtual currencies. “Once our proof of concept goes from beta to live, I think that we are going to take market dominance in the full aspect.”

Some potential investors did not share Mr. Sharma’s enthusiasm and discussed their concerns on Reddit and other social media platforms. But those criticisms ended up having less of an impact than the social media nods from Mr. Mayweather and DJ Khaled.

And he was a master of the wordless vocal, making hits out of songs full of “woo-woos” and “la-las.”

Working with the songwriter, producer and arranger David Bartholomew, Mr. Domino and his band carried New Orleans parade rhythms into rock ’n’ roll and put a local stamp on nearly everything they touched, even country tunes like “Jambalaya” or big-band songs like “My Blue Heaven” and “When My Dreamboat Comes Home.”



‘A Good Ear for Catchin’ Notes’

Antoine Dominique Domino Jr. was born on Feb. 26, 1928, the youngest of eight children in a family with Creole roots. He grew up in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, where he spent most of his life.

Music filled his life from the age of 10, when his family inherited an old piano. After his brother-in-law Harrison Verrett, a traditional-jazz musician, wrote down the notes on the keys and taught him a few chords, Antoine threw himself at the instrument — so enthusiastically that his parents moved it to the garage.

He was almost entirely self-taught, picking up ideas from boogie-woogie masters like Meade Lux Lewis, Pinetop Smith and Amos Milburn. “Back then I used to play everybody’s records; everybody’s records who made records,” he told the New Orleans music magazine Offbeat in 2004. “I used to hear ’em, listen at ’em five, six, seven, eight times and I could play it just like the record because I had a good ear for catchin’ notes and different things.”

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School but dropped out in the fourth grade to work as an iceman’s helper. “In the houses where people had a piano in their rooms, I’d stop and play,” he told USA Today in 2007. “That’s how I practiced.”

In his teens, he started working at a club called the Hideaway with a band led by the bassist Billy Diamond, who nicknamed him Fats. Mr. Domino soon became the band’s frontman and a local draw.

“Fats was breaking up the place, man,” Mr. Bartholomew told The Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2010. “He was singing and playing the piano and carrying on. Everyone was having a good time. When you saw Fats Domino, it was ‘Let’s have a party!’ ”

He added: “My first impression was a lasting impression. He was a great singer. He was a great artist. And whatever he was doing, nobody could beat him.”

Slide Show

In 1947 Mr. Domino married Rosemary Hall, and they had eight children, Antoine III, Anatole, Andre, Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola and Adonica. His wife died in 2008. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.

In 1949 Mr. Bartholomew brought Lew Chudd, the owner of Imperial Records in Los Angeles, to the Hideaway. Mr. Chudd signed Mr. Domino on the spot, with a contract, unusual for the time, that paid royalties rather than a one-time purchase of songs.

Immediately, Mr. Domino and Mr. Bartholomew wrote “The Fat Man,” a cleaned-up version of a song about drug addiction called “Junkers Blues,” and recorded it with Mr. Bartholomew’s studio band. By 1951 it had sold a million copies.

Mr. Domino’s trademark triplets, picked up from “It’s Midnight,” a 1949 record by the boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield, appeared on his next rhythm-and-blues hit, “Every Night About This Time.” The technique spread like wildfire, becoming a virtual requirement for rock ’n’ roll ballads.

“Fats made it popular,” Mr. Bartholomew told Rick Coleman, the author of “Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock ’n’ Roll” (2006). “Then it was on every record.”

In 1952, on a chance visit to Cosimo Matassa’s recording studio in New Orleans, Mr. Domino was asked to help out on a recording by a nervous teenager named Lloyd Price. Sitting in with Mr. Bartholomew’s band, he came up with the memorable piano part for “Lawdy Miss Clawdy,” one of the first rhythm-and-blues records to cross over to a pop audience

Trading Tracks on the Charts

Through the early 1950s Mr. Domino turned out a stream of hits, taking up what seemed like permanent residence in the upper reaches of the R&B charts. His records began reaching the pop charts as well.

In that racially segregated era, white performers used his hits to build their careers. In 1955, “Ain’t It a Shame” became a No. 1 hit for Pat Boone as “Ain’t That a Shame,” while Domino’s arrangement of a traditional song, “Bo Weevil,” was imitated by Teresa Brewer.

Mr. Domino’s appeal to white teenagers broadened as he embarked on national tours and appeared with mixed-race rock ’n’ roll revues like the Moondog Jubilee of Stars Under the Stars, presented by the disc jockey Alan Freed at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Appearances on national television, on Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan’s shows, put him in millions of living rooms.

He did not flaunt his status as an innovator, or as an architect of a powerful cultural movement.

“Fats, how did this rock ’n’ roll all get started anyway?” an interviewer for a Hearst newsreel asked him in 1957. Mr. Domino answered: “Well, what they call rock ’n’ roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.”

At a news conference in Las Vegas in 1969, after resuming his performing career, Elvis Presley interrupted a reporter who had called him “the king.” He pointed to Mr. Domino, who was in the room, and said, “There’s the real king of rock ’n’ roll.”

Mr. Domino had his biggest hit in 1956 with his version of “Blueberry Hill,” a song that had been recorded by Glenn Miller’s big band in 1940. It peaked at No. 2 on the pop charts and sold a reported three million copies.

“I liked that record ’cause I heard it by Louis Armstrong and I said, ‘That number gonna fit me,’ ” he told Offbeat. “We had to beg Lew Chudd for a while. I told him I wasn’t gonna make no more records till they put that record out. I could feel it, that it was a hit, a good record.”

He followed with two more Top Five pop hits: “Blue Monday” and “I’m Walkin’,” which outsold the version recorded by Ricky Nelson.

“I was lucky enough to write songs that carry a good beat and tell a real story that people could feel was their story, too — something that old people or the kids could both enjoy,” Mr. Domino told The Los Angeles Times in 1985.

Mr. Domino performed in 1950s movies like “Shake, Rattle and Rock,” “The Big Beat” (for which he and Mr. Bartholomew wrote the title song) and “The Girl Can’t Help It.” In 1957, he toured for three months with Chuck Berry, Clyde McPhatter, the Moonglows and others.

Well into the early 1960s, Mr. Domino continued to reach both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with songs like “Whole Lotta Lovin’,” “I’m Ready,” “I’m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,” “Be My Guest,” “Walkin’ to New Orleans” and “My Girl Josephine.”

He toured Europe for the first time in 1962 and met the Beatles in Liverpool, before they were famous. His contract with Imperial ended in 1963, and he went on to record for ABC-Paramount, Mercury, Broadmoor, Reprise and other labels.

His last appearance in the pop Top 100 was in 1968, with a version of “Lady Madonna,” the Beatles song that had been inspired by Mr. Domino’s piano-pounding style. In 1982, he had a country hit with “Whiskey Heaven.”

Although he was no longer a pop sensation, Mr. Domino continued to perform worldwide and appeared for 10 months a year in Las Vegas in the mid-1960s. On tour, he would bring his own pots and pans so he could cook.

A New Orleans Fixture

His life on the road ended in the early 1980s, when he decided that he did not want to leave New Orleans, saying it was the only place where he liked the food.

He went on to perform regularly at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and in 1987 Jerry Lee Lewis and Ray Charles joined him for a Cinemax special, “Fats Domino and Friends.” He released a holiday album, “Christmas Is a Special Day,” in 1993.

Reclusive and notoriously resistant to interview requests, Mr. Domino stayed home even when he received a lifetime achievement Grammy Award in 1987. (He did travel to New York when he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as one of its first members, although he did not take part in the jam session that concluded the ceremony.) In 1999, when he was awarded the National Medal of Arts, he sent his daughter Antoinette to the White House to pick up the prize.

He even refused to leave New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina devastated the city on Aug. 29, 2005, remaining at his flooded home — he was living in the Lower Ninth Ward then — until he was rescued by helicopter on Sept. 1.

“I wasn’t too nervous” about waiting to be saved, he told The New York Times in 2006. “I had my little wine and a couple of beers with me; I’m all right.”

His rescue was loosely the basis for “Saving Fats,” a tall tale in Sam Shepard’s 2010 short-story collection, “Day Out of Days.”

President George W. Bush visited Mr. Domino’s home in 2006 in recognition of New Orleans’s cultural resilience; that same year, Mr. Domino released “Alive and Kickin,’ ” his first album in more than a decade. The title song began, “All over the country, people want to know / Whatever happened to Fats Domino,” then continued, “I’m alive and kicking and I’m where I wanna be.”

He was often seen around New Orleans, emerging from his pink-roofed mansion driving a pink Cadillac. “I just drink my little beers, do some cookin’, anything I feel like,” he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2007, describing his retirement.

In 1953, in Down Beat magazine, the Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler made a bold-sounding prediction that turned out to be, in retrospect, quite timid. “Can’t you envision a collector in 1993 discovering a Fats Domino record in a Salvation Army depot and rushing home to put it on the turntable?” he wrote. “We can. It’s good blues, it’s good jazz, and it’s the kind of good that never wears out.”","Fats Domino, Early Rock ’n’ Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html

The legislative skirmish could also imperil the agenda of Philip D. Murphy, the Democratic candidate for governor, who has a significant lead in the polls.

Should Mr. Sweeney lose, Mr. Murphy’s plan to raise the minimum wage to $15, provide more funding for Planned Parenthood and legalize marijuana would face a much more difficult legislative path, not just because the Democratic advantage in the Senate would shrink, but because Mr. Sweeney is an adroit power broker.

Mr. Murphy, who has the support of Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union, has chosen not to take sides, a stance that some Democratic leaders have privately complained about and that could lead to a strained relationship if Mr. Murphy is elected governor.

“This is one where folks don’t always, where three parties, don’t always come out to the same conclusion,” Mr. Murphy said, referring to himself, Mr. Sweeney and the union. “I’m on the line with him, on the ballot with him, and trying to get him elected, and, to his credit, he’s trying to get me elected.”

Mr. Murphy would not say if he would ask the teachers’ union to stop campaigning against Mr. Sweeney.

“The one thing I’ve done explicitly is to be there beside him, and that’s the reason I was texting him today,” Mr. Murphy said about Mr. Sweeney. “Because I said, ‘Listen, I want to come down and campaign with him, go door to door, be visible and be seen with him.’”

Mr. Sweeney said he believed that Mr. Murphy had sought to quietly reach out to the union.

“He told me he tried,” Mr. Sweeney said. “So I’m going to take him at his word, even though there have been publications and people saying that he didn’t. Because he said he did. And I want to work with Phil next year.”

Other Democrats have jumped into the fray. Last month, 16 Democratic state senators signed a letter to Marie Blistan, the president of the union, condemning its strategy.

“It’s inconceivable to us that the N.J.E.A. is supporting Republican extremist Fran Grenier, an avowed ally of Chris Christie and Donald Trump, both of whom have demonized teachers and unions throughout their political careers,” the letter said.

The teachers’ union claims that its effort to unseat Mr. Sweeney is driven by its members.

“Our members made it extremely clear that they want to see a change of leadership,” said Steve Baker, the union’s director of communications. “Clearly, Steve Sweeney is very, very well financed. He has the support of a lot of people who have been able to put a lot of money into his campaign, and in order to run a strong campaign, we’ve had to also step up and be willing to invest in that endorsement that our members made.”

Mr. Grenier did not respond to emails requesting comment.

As the race enters its final days, the teachers’ union has continued its advertising blitz. Since Sept. 27, Garden State Forward, the “super PAC” run by the union, has spent nearly $3 million on television advertisements, including $600,000 to broadcast one attack ad during a single week, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that tracks ad spending.

To put the roughly $3 million worth of television commercials in context, that is more than Mr. Murphy’s campaign has spent on broadcast ads throughout the state during the general election, according to Advertising Analytics.

Mr. Sweeney said the union has also distributed pamphlets critical of him to legislators and candidates in other districts, a move that he interpreted as the union issuing a warning about what happens when an elected official crosses the labor group.

“This is sending a message to the other legislators,” Mr. Sweeney said.

The bad blood between Mr. Sweeney and the teachers’ union stems from disagreements over pensions. In 2011, Mr. Sweeney pushed a bill that became law limiting state contributions to pension and health benefits. Last year, Mr. Sweeney broke his promise to support a constitutional amendment that would require the state to make full pension payments every quarter.

For the teachers, this was unforgivable.

Despite the onslaught, Mr. Sweeney said he was confident that he would prevail. As for the future of his relationship with the teachers’ union, Mr. Sweeney was uncertain.

“The bigger question is how do they figure on going forward with me,” he said. “I’m not a grudge guy by any means. But they’ve made this pretty personal.”",New Jersey Teachers’ Union Wages Costly War Against Powerful Democrat,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/nyregion/nj-teachers-union-wages-costly-war-against-powerful-democrat.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
