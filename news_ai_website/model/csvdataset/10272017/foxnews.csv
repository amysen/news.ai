Country star Alan Jackson, the late guitarist and singer Jerry Reed and songwriter Don Schlitz were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.

Country icon Loretta Lynn returned to the Hall of Fame for the first time since she suffered a stroke in May to formally induct Jackson. Lynn, who cancelled her tour dates this year to recover, said Jackson was the only person that could make her leave her house.

She recalled meeting Jackson when he was a nervous young artist decades ago and knowing then that he would ""be one of the greatest singers in country music.""

""He hadn't let me down,"" said Lynn, who is also a member of the Hall of Fame.

The 59-year-old Jackson is still one of country music's most successful solo artists, having sold nearly 45 million albums in the United States and had 26 singles reach the top of the Billboard country charts.

With his baritone voice and knack for telling stories about small town Southern life, the Newnan, Georgia-born singer was among a wave of neo-traditionalists that broke through in the 1990s.

He joked that when he was signed to Arista Nashville, a label started by Clive Davis, they had no idea how popular he would become.

""I was just a token country singer they signed for that label and bam, I took off,"" Jackson said.

Many of his hits became instant classics, from the barroom staple ""Chattahoochee"" to the somber ""Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)"" written after the Sept. 11 attacks.

But he's also been characterized as shy and uneasy in the media spotlight.

""I am not really shy, just socially awkward,"" Jackson said. ""I just don't like to talk too much.""

Instead, he let his songs speak for him, often writing about his father, his wife and the everyday joys and sorrows of the average man. Other hits include ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"" ''A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)"" and ""When Somebody Loves You.""

George Strait, Alison Krauss and Lee Ann Womack each performed one of Jackson's songs in his honor.

Reed, who died at age 71 in 2008, was first known as an in-demand studio musician with a unique finger picking style on the guitar. He played for and wrote songs for stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner.

Reed, originally from Atlanta, became more popular when his songs began charting. His hit song ""When You're Hot, You're Hot"" earned him a Grammy award.

In later years, he started appearing in TV and movies, most notably playing Burt Reynolds' sidekick in ""Smokey and the Bandit."" He also sang many of the songs on the soundtrack, including ""East Bound and Down.""

His daughters, Seidina Hubbard and Lottie Zavala, accepted the honor on his behalf.

Hubbard said one of her fondest memories of growing up was listening ""to the beautiful sound of that guitar in the house all the time.""

Performing some of his songs were guitarists Tommy Emmanuel, John Knowles and Steve Wariner, while Jamey Johnson performed one of his personal favorites, ""East Bound and Down.""

Schlitz, 65, from Durham, North Carolina, had his first songwriting hit in 1978 when Kenny Rogers recorded his song, ""The Gambler,"" which became Rogers' signature song throughout his career.

Other songs he helped write include ""On the Other Hand"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" both sung by Randy Travis; ""When You Say Nothing at All,"" recorded by both Keith Whitley and Alison Krauss; and ""Strong Enough to Bend,"" by Tanya Tucker.

He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and helped to create the popular songwriters in the round format at Nashville's famed Bluebird Café.

Aloe Blacc and Vince Gill sang a duet version of ""The Gambler,"" while singers Charlie Worsham and Mary Chapin Carpenter also performed his songs in his honor.

Schlitz gave some advice to his grandchildren seated in the audience from what he had learned in his career.

""No one does this alone. In your life, be a part of something bigger than yourself,"" Schlitz said.",Loretta Lynn returns after stroke to honor Alan Jackson,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/loretta-lynn-returns-after-stroke-to-honor-alan-jackson.html

Barry Brown, Dean Wade and Kamau Stokes have done more than just provide a solid foundation.

After essentially starting since their freshman year, the trio helped the Wildcats return to the NCAA Tournament last season, knocking off Wake Forest in an opening-round game. And now they are back for their junior seasons as the unquestioned leaders of a team with higher aspirations.

""They are going to have to play like seniors, with consistency,"" Weber said. ""Our little quote for the summer was, 'If you never wake up with something to prove, you will never improve.' We have talked about that all summer, and to me there is no doubt they have improved. Now we have to show it.""

The Wildcats certainly have pieces to replace from last year's 21-14 finish.

Wesley Iwundu grew from a quiet role player into an NBA draft pick. D.J. Johnson provided size and scoring in the paint. Carlbe Ervin II was a solid perimeter defender. Austin Budke was the gritty, overachieving forward. And when Isaiah Maurice was kicked out of the program for violating team rules, it left a gaping hole inside that the Wildcats must patch with transfers and freshmen.

But when you combine the Wildcats' junior trio with Xavier Sneed, who played meaningful minutes as a freshman, and redshirts Cartier Diarra and forward James Love III, there is plenty of experience.

There are also plenty of newcomers to fill in the roster.

Forward Mawdo Sallah is a 6-foot-8 graduate transfer from Mt. St. Mary's, and Makol Mawien is a 6-9 forward from New Mexico Junior College. They'll be joined by incoming prospects Nigel Shadd and Levi Stockard to give the Wildcats plenty of big bodies in the paint.

The Wildcats will also try to mix junior college transfer Amaad Wainright, a 6-4 guard, and top-100 prospect Mike McGuirl into the mix to give the veterans on the perimeter a breather.

""This year's team is going to be competitive,"" Brown said. ""We have a lot of flexible guys that can play multiple positions. We're going to be athletic, long, shoot the 3 at a higher efficiency and get to the basket. I feel that we are going to improve in every statistic.""

Including wins, the only one that ultimately matters.

As the Wildcats prepare for the season, here are some of the key story lines:

USA TODAY Sports | Denny Medley

TOURNEY EXPERIENCE:The Wildcats played poorly in their NCAA Tournament loss to Cincinnati, but the experience was still beneficial. They had missed out on playing in it in back-to-back years.

""It was real motivational,"" said Stokes, who led the Wildcats in assists last year. ""We know we can get there and we just have to get these new guys on board so we can get back to that point.""

BRUCE'S CONTRACT:Weber agreed to a two-year extension in August that could keep him with the Wildcats through the 2020-21 season. It was the first major personnel move by new Kansas State athletic director Gene Taylor, and an important vote of confidence for a coach who had been on the hot seat.

SCHEDULE PREVIEW:Kansas State opens Nov. 10 against American and has high-profile non-conference games against Arizona State, Vanderbilt, Washington State and Georgia. Then comes the double-round robin Big 12 schedule, which includes a three-game stretch against Kansas, West Virginia and Texas.

THE DEAN:Brown and Stokes get a lot of attention for being flashy perimeter scorers, but it may be the 6-8 Wade who needs to take the biggest step this season. He averaged 9.3 points and 4.5 rebounds last season, but there are some who think he could be a regular double-double guy.

""I see someone who was not aggressive enough, offensively and defensively, especially in rebounding,"" he acknowledged, ""but I also see a ton of room to grow. Hopefully, this offseason I have grown enough to expand my game.""

X MARKS THE SPOT:Sneed arrived at Kansas State with more prep credentials than anyone, and there were times that he showed his promise. But after pouring in 17 points in his college debut, he struggled to have consistent success, failing to reach double figures in his final 10 games.

That’s the burning question before the release of Apple’s much-heralded revamp of the iPhone on Nov. 3.

The iPhone X sports what Apple calls a “revolutionary new design” with a 5.8-inch all-screen display, wireless charging, new 3D sensors, augmented reality, facial recognition and an advanced rear camera.

WILL CONSUMERS PAY $1,000 (OR MORE) FOR THE NEXT IPHONE?

Earlier this week, Apple said the new iPhone will be available at its stores “for walk-in customers, who are encouraged to arrive early.""

Pre-orders began Friday morning October 27 at 12:01 a.m. PDT and shipping times were already slipping, just a few hours later.

Both the 64GB version and the 256GB version were already showing shipping dates between 5 and 6 weeks a few hours after the device was made available.

For the average consumer waltzing into an Apple Store on Friday Nov. 3, the prospects of picking up an iPhone are not great.

""We anticipate very limited quantities at launch as the supply of key components has been constrained,"" Jitesh Ubrani, an IDC analyst, told Fox News.

Things could slowly improve, however. “Recently we’ve heard that a few obstacles have been cleared so this should mean more product availability later in November and December,” Ryan Reith, another analyst at IDC told Fox News.

But supply may not catch up to demand until next year. ""Apple will [have] supply constraint on the iPhone X until well into the start of 2018,"" Wayne Lam, IHS Markit, Principal Analyst, Mobile Electronics, told Fox News.

One estimate, from oft-cited Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, puts availability at between two and three million units at launch.

If accurate, that may be a drop in the bucket for expected overall demand at launch. The consensus for total production in the fourth calendar quarter of this year, ending Dec. 31, falls between 25 and 30 million units, depending on which analysts’ forecast you believe.

Morgan Stanley believes Apple will sell 30 million iPhone X units in the calendar fourth quarter.

APPLE ISSUES RESPONSE TO SENATE INQUIRY ON FACE ID CONCERNS

Smartphone market reset

Apple is trying to establish a new smartphone high water mark with a device packed to the gills with new technology.

The 5.8-inch Super Retina display, Apple’s first organic-light-emitting diode display on an iPhone, is the thing most consumers will recognize immediately as being different. That’s because it’s all-glass with no bezels, a first for an iPhone.

The other stand-out is the notch at the top of display. That contains, among other things, Apple’s TrueDepth camera that enables Face ID – another first for Apple. On the back is a redesigned rear camera with dual optical image stabilization (for reduced blurring) on both the wide angle and telephoto lenses.

ESPN came under fire in August after they pulled an announcer from a college football game named Robert Lee because his name is similar to that of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.

The network also faced heat after suspending Jemele Hill earlier in October after she violated their social media guidelines twice for calling on Twitter for people to boycott advertisers over the NFL protests and for calling President Trump a ""white supremacist.""

HISTORY OF COMBAT BOOTS IN PICTURESLast year, the U.S. Navy announced that it is getting rid of its blue camouflage ‘blueberries’ uniform.","The U.S. Army is developing a lightweight hot weather alternative to the current Army Combat Uniform (ACU) and new jungle boots.

The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric. This means that “when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet,” the Army explained in a statement released this week. “And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot,” it added.

The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said. The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.

THE EVOLUTION OF US MILITARY CAMOUFLAGE: FROM BASIC GREEN AND KHAKI TO DIGITAL PATTERNS AND BEYOND

""You can hold that uniform up with one finger,"" said Brig. Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.

While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons. All of these features hold water “and cost money,” he added.

The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.

HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES

U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.

The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year. Cummings explained, however, that the new uniform’s fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing. This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniform’s ability to wick away water.

The new uniform’s flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.

In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot. Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.

EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS

Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer. They have also requested thinner soles.

The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be ""a lot more pliable. And able to serve the soldier well. But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years.""

The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested.

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

“The Sheriff’s Office continues to examine the brand and its possible meaning, but details of the brand remain confidential as part of the on-going investigation,” police said.","Investigators have released new details in the mysterious case of a young mother in Northern California who vanished for three weeks last year — including the discovery of male DNA on her clothing, even though the so-called “super mom” claimed her kidnappers were women.

Sherri Papini disappeared on November 2, 2016 while she was out for a run near her home.

The Shasta County sheriff’s department said that investigators collected male DNA from the clothing that she was wearing when she was found. Female DNA also was discovered on Papini’s body. The samples have not been identified.

Days before Papini’s disappearance, police said she was texting with a man in Michigan, and the two tried to meet up while he was in California. Investigators later interviewed the man, and determined he was not involved in Papini’s disappearance.

The mother of two disappeared in Shasta County, about 215 miles north of San Francisco. Her phone, with headphones attached, was found alongside the rural road where she lived in the little community of Mountain Gate, north of Redding, according to The Mercury News. Papini was found alongside Interstate 5 in Yolo County, about 100 miles from her home on Thanksgiving.

No ransom demand was ever received, and neither the Papinis nor their families are wealthy, Sheriff Tom Bosenko said. She is a stay-at-home mom and he is a Best Buy store employee.

The FBI on Wednesday also released sketches of two women who Papini said abducted her.

The first woman was described by Papini as Hispanic, between 20 and 30 years old, about 5 feet 5 inches tall, with coarse, curly dark hair, thin eyebrows and pierced ears, FBI officials said.

The second woman was described as Hispanic, between 40 and 50 years old, about 5 feet 7 inches tall, with long, straight black hair with some gray in it. She had thick eyebrows and pierced ears, the FBI said.

In a newly released 911 call, according to Fox 2, her husband Keith reported that his wife had not picked up their children from their daycare provider and that he didn’t know her whereabouts. In the call, he described the last time he heard from her and what she was wearing.

“I’m, like, totally freaking out thinking, like, somebody grabbed her,” he said.

According to the Shasta County sheriff’s department, her husband said he had found her phone — with strands of ripped-out hair — on the road after activating the Find My Phone feature.

Authorities said they conducted a polygraph exam of Keith and “excluded him from involvement” in his wife’s disappearance.

“This has been an extraordinarily difficult time for our entire family,” he said in a written statement Wednesday. “We ask that the media please respect our need for privacy as Sherri continues to heal and we work towards putting our lives back together.”

Papini and her husband are believed to still live in Redding, Calif.

Sgt. Brian Jackson told The Sacramento Bee that there was no particular reason for the timing of the new information, other than detectives hoped it would generate new leads.

“It has taken time for Sherri to recover to a point to be able to provide accurate details to the sketch artist,” the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release, noting FBI artists are being released 10 months after her disappearance because of Papini’s difficulty in recalling what her abductors looked like. “The sketches then needed to be finalized and approved for release by the FBI.”

Papini also told investigators the women were driving a dark-colored SUV with a “large rear side window.”

“Sherri continues to look at photographs of various makes and models of SUV’s in an effort to provide a more detailed description,” the sheriff’s office said.

The sheriff’s office also gave additional details on Papini’s physical condition when she was found.

Her nose was broken, and she was wearing a chain restraint around her waist. Her blonde hair had been cut to shoulder length, and she had a brand burned into her right shoulder.

“The Sheriff’s Office continues to examine the brand and its possible meaning, but details of the brand remain confidential as part of the on-going investigation,” police said.

The sheriff’s office added, “Sherri, however, stated she had not been sexually assaulted, and there is no physical evidence to indicate otherwise.”

Officials said they have received over 600 tips from around the world as part of their investigation, and continue to review all tips they receive.

A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the identification of the two women.

Anyone with information about the Papini investigation or the two captors is urged to call the FBI at 916-746-7000.

For her public duties, the Duchess of Cambridge is always pictured with au naturel nails, and there is strict reason for this.

According to OK! magazine, colored nail varnish and fake nails are not part of the royal etiquette, and are typically considered to be “vulgar.""

On the rare occasion that her nails do have a slick of polish on them, she opts for a nude shade, similar to the Queen’s personal favorite.

Queen Elizabeth is said to have worn Essie's Nail Lacquer in Ballet Slippers since 1989.

According to the brand's website, Queen Elizabeth's hairdresser wrote to the brand's owner, nail polish-mogul Essie Weingarten, asking for a bottle of the light pink polish as she didn't want to wear any other.

The only time Kate has deviated from the Ballet Slippers shade was her wedding day to Prince William.

On the big day, her manicurist Marina Sandoval revealed her nails were a custom mix of Bourjois So Laque Nail Enamel in Rose Lounge and Essie Nail Polish in Allure.

“That was absolutely the low point of my career,” Fox told Cosmopolitan UK’s November issue. “But without ‘that thing’ I wouldn’t have learned as quickly as I did. All I had to do was apologize — and I refused. I was so self-righteous at 23, I couldn’t see [that] it was for the greater good. I really thought I was Joan of Arc.”

“It hurt me and a lot of other people,” she continued. “However, that darkness that descended caused enormous and brisk spiritual growth. Once I realized I [had] brought it on myself, it was an invaluable learning experience, looking back on it.”

The “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” star isn’t too enthusiastic about many of her movie offers, in part because they don’t line up with her feminist beliefs.

“I’m not going to be an actress forever. I’ve always known I have another calling,” she said. “I still get offered a lot of ‘genius strippers’ and ‘funny escorts’ by guys in the business, but I don’t want to be involved with something genuinely degrading or that [which] encourages negative sexual ideals about women.

Still, the lingerie model admits that she understands some of the motivations behind Hollywood’s objectification of women.

“I’m not ashamed of sexy poses or parts. It’s just a biological fact: sex does sell. But I wish it was more gender equal,” she explained. “I’m happy to buy some sex, too. It’s not wrong, it just needs to go both ways. Women shouldn’t have to carry the burden. And I think we have so far.”

Snuggling in bed under a layer of cozy covers makes for a deliciously warm feeling, especially in the face of unrelenting winter chill. If you’re in the market for a new blanket or quilt, be sure to read this guide for advice on how to choose the best bedding for your needs.

Blankets

Shopping for a blanket can feel fairly straightforward. And maybe it is. But with a little information, you’ll be more likely to bring home a product that you’ll cherish and love using.

Start with size. Typically, you’re looking for a blanket that will cover the top and sides of the mattress with a few extra inches to tuck securely underneath. Be sure to measure your mattress before you shop.

Compare fabrics. You can choose from a wide range of materials, and narrowing them down should depend on your preferences. You may suffer from allergies or prefer a smoother texture over a fuzzier one, for example.

○ Blankets made of wool are warm and provide excellent insulation on cold winter nights. Being a natural fiber, wool is breathable. Another useful quality is its ability to wick sweat and moisture away from the body, promoting a dry and warm experience. Woolen blankets are naturally fire-resistant, which makes them relatively safe to use around heat sources.

○ Usually composed of a polyester blend, synthetic fleece blankets are popular because they feel plush, velvety soft and warm. They also can wick moisture from your body, keeping you warm, dry and snug through a cold night. Synthetic fleece blankets are lighter than their woolen counterparts. It pays to ask for ones that don’t pill (produce tiny balls of fibers from abrasion). On the downside, synthetic fleece can conduct static electricity and can attract hair and dust.

○ Ideal for warm weather, a 100 percent cotton blanket is also great during spring and autumn or with air conditioning in the room. Since cotton is a natural fiber, it’s breathable. It’s also hypoallergenic and soft, making it a smart choice for babies, allergy sufferers or those with sensitive skin. When buying a cotton blanket, consider yarn size, fiber quality, thread count and construction. Typically, a good cotton blanket will have a higher thread count.

○ Blankets made of acrylic are a great alternative to their woolen or cashmere counterparts since they’re light, hypoallergenic and warm. What’s more, they are machine-washable and retain their colors.

Do a quality check. “You can really feel a good-quality textile in your hands,” says Kate Pascoe Squires, director of Australian textile company Kate & Kate. “If it feels beautiful, it usually will be. If it’s flimsy, thin or shiny, you know it’s not going to last. Be prepared for balling and pills after the first wash. Good-quality natural fibers will wash beautifully and offer you a gorgeous product for years to come.”

Compare prices. You can pick up a twin blanket for under $20, but it won’t last very long, Pascoe Squires says. “You can also purchase stunning midrange blankets that are great quality but won’t break the bank. In terms of price, you should look at between [$60 and $120] for these items. Then there are super-premium blankets, which can run up to thousands of dollars. The price reflects the beautiful materials used to knit these items, usually stunning wools, creating real heirloom pieces.”

Electric Blankets

If you’d rather invest in an electric blanket, here’s what you need to know:

○ Electric blankets use an integrated heating device to spread warmth through your bed.

○ Electric blankets for children are normally available and labeled as waterproof electric blankets.

○ Thanks to the overheat protection feature, your blanket should sense any abnormal temperature changes and switch off if it gets too hot. However, you should never leave your blanket on all night.

○ Fitted blankets remain flat and taut through the night and feel the same as the mattress underneath it. Unfitted blankets won’t fit around the corners or provide the same level of comfort as fitted ones.

○ Before making a purchase, lie on the blanket to feel its thickness, and check that the wiring is undamaged.

○ Some blankets are available with dual controls, so each partner can control the temperature on one side of the bed.

○ If your blanket has removable controls, you can safely wash it as well.

○ If your feet feel cold easily, look for a blanket with warm foot zones, which focus more heat at the bottom of the blanket.

Quilts



Quilts offer luxurious comfort and add visual warmth to your bedroom. A quilt usually consists of three layers: a fabric backing, a layer of soft batting and a fabric top. Quilting is essentially the art of stitching or tying these layers together, often in sync with the pattern of the top.

Consider the user and the climate. Typically, adults prefer heavier quilts, whereas children are comfortable with lightweight ones. When you’re buying a quilt for your child, remember that you’ll be dealing with spills and other messes.

It pays to factor in climate. Are you looking for a quilt for very cold nights or just cool weather? Do you need something that is season-specific or something that works for all kinds of weather?

Know the types of filling. Quilts filled with natural materials such as cotton, wool, feathers and down are more breathable, softer, lighter and more comfortable. They also will last longer than synthetic or microfiber fillings. Cotton makes an excellent choice for lightweight quilts.

Although down and feather fillings provide the most warmth, they are more expensive and may not be ideal for those with allergies. In these instances, options like microfiber work well since they imitate the look and feel of down without attracting dust. Cotton and wool are naturally hypoallergenic options.

If you’re tired of alternating between a lightweight quilt for summer and a heavier one for winter, consider an all-season quilt.

Care for your quilt. Air your quilt every couple of weeks to keep it in great shape and enhance its longevity. Certain quilts, such as down, are best dry-cleaned, while some can be machine-washed as well. A duvet cover can protect your quilt and add to your room’s decor. Remember to read the manufacturer’s care guide that comes with your purchase.",How to choose the best bedding for cold winter nights,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/how-to-choose-best-bedding-for-cold-winter-nights.html

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.
Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it.
Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do.
But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","I sat on a parenting panel last month with a well-known and widely respected counselor by the name of Sissy Goff, M.Ed, LPC-MHSP. She is the Director of Child & Adolescent Counseling at Daystar in Nashville and when asked about the biggest issue facing kids today, she confirmed what you’ve probably read about recently on your news feed or even your Facebook feed – the increasing anxiety epidemic in our country.

But it’s not just an epidemic among our kids. It’s an epidemic among us -- their parents.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults.

In a recent article entitled “Why Are More American Teenagers Than Ever Suffering from Severe Anxiety” we glean significant insight into the anxiety epidemic:

I’ll just share just two key points from the article:

* Privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. These kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic.

* For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they never get to the point where they can say, ‘I’ve done enough, and now I can stop.’ Kids have a sense that they’re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.

If you’re reading this article as a mom, I imagine it breaks your heart like it breaks mine (as the mother of four boys who range in age from toddler to teenager) to learn that the pressure our kids are under “is relentless and getting worse.” Of course, I think we already assumed this to be true. But knowing it to be true leaves us responsible to do something to fight against it.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

See, we parents aren’t the only ones linking accomplishment to acceptance and success to significance. Our kids are attempting to answer the question, “Is who I am enough?” by how well they perform on the field, how much they excel in school, and how many likes they get on their Instagram feed.

They are attempting to answer that question, “Is who I am enough?” by proving they can do enough and be enough. Whatever “enough” is. Because you and I both know enough is never enough when the goal is perpetual perfection.

The primary message our kids receive is that they’d better be the best at everything, and this leaves them afraid to reveal their inadequacies and insecurities—and hiding behind the best version of themselves.

In turn, parents of anxious teens feel helpless and hopeless, questioning all of the steps we are -- or aren’t -- taking. Our confidence as moms crumbles as we try to help our kids navigate the battles they have to fight and the mountains they have to climb.

We are constantly second guessing ourselves: “Have I done too much? Have I not done enough? Am I helping or am I hurting my child?”

Our anxiety escalates and overflows into our parenting and onto our kids, who then take our anxiety on top of their own.

I won’t pretend to even begin to be able to solve this for us here. I don’t have all the answers. Not even a little bit. But I do have this one nugget – which is the primary message woven into my new book, ""Mom Set Free,"" and I believe it to be true with everything in me.

A key ingredient in helping our kids overcome their anxiety is facing and working through our own anxiety.

It starts with us. It doesn’t end with us. But we are part of the solution.

We have to be willing to take an honest (maybe painfully honest) look at how we may have contributed to the anxiety our kids feel with the pressure we just might be passing down. With our unrealistic expectations and impossible standards of ourselves, and of them.

Of course, some kids are just more prone to perfection seeking than others. Such kids tend to create their own pressure, even if their parents are actively trying to relieve it. But often, we parents play a role in the pressure -- and therefore, anxiety -- our kids feel, so we have to be willing to take an honest look at how we pile our own pressure onto our kids.

And ultimately, it is our responsibility to help our kids push back the pressure they face with the truth of God’s Word. I am not at all suggesting that therapy and medication aren’t part of the solution. They often times are. But please let us not forget the alive and powerful Word of God that has the absolute power to show us where our significance comes from and ultimately set us free from proving our worth and our value in our performance.

Kids who constantly feel like they just don't measure up and who feel they have “everything” to prove need to be told – over and over again - they actually have “nothing” to prove. Because this pressure to prove our value and worth has left parents and children alike longing for what all our hearts most crave:

• to be known—truly and deeply known

• to be accepted—for who they are, not who they wish they were to be loved—with no strings attached

This isn’t sentimental fluff. This is solid truth from which freedom springs. There is absolutely no denying the inherent and deepest longing every human soul holds.

If we want to raise kids who find freedom from the pressure to get it ALL right in order to be accepted and welcomed, then we are going to need to walk in that freedom first. Or at least be willing to discover how to walk in that freedom alongside our kids.

We need to know that failing doesn’t make us failures and succeeding doesn’t make us significant. At least not in the eyes of our Creator -- the only One whose opinion of us really matters in the end.

In God’s eyes we are of great worth, not because of anything we have or haven’t done, but because of what has been done for us in the person and work of Jesus Christ.

The cross has the final word on our value. Believing that truth and embracing that truth isn’t the only thing we need to do. But it is a firm foundation on which to build a life of freedom from anxiety and the exhausting endless quest to prove our value through our performance.","America's teen anxiety epidemic is heartbreaking.

And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts.
Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts?
Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts.","Sitting at my usual corner table in the back of Buzzy’s 8-Ball Tavern and Pool Room, It occurred to me on Thursday night that there are any number of serious issues and current crisis that we could talk about for this week’s dispatch from the front lines.

But setting all those issues aside, let me tell you something that may have escaped your attention while you’ve been busy digging a backyard bomb shelter or getting up to speed on which starlets haven’t been groped by Weinstein. Apparently, and I did not see this coming, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) leadership has decided to open the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts to, wait for it… girls.

Now, if you’re like me, you probably have always assumed that boys would tend to join the Boy Scouts and girls would tend to gravitate to the Girl Scouts. Boys whittled wood into sharp, pointy things and set fire to stuff, while girls generated an incredible amount of revenue selling delicious cookies. I’m particularly fond of Samoas.

My oldest boy Scooter is in the Cub Scouts, and I can vouch for the fact that he and his Den cohorts love to whittle. They can take a 400 pound oak log and turn it into a sharp, pointy twig in less time than it takes to whistle the theme to ""The Andy Griffith Show."" To be honest, they’re a pack of smelly, loud boys with a remarkable ability to recite the entire Scout oath while actually burping. I can see why girls would be clamoring to join.

In reality, most are not. And the Girl Scouts of America, which after taking into account global cookie sales, I believe is the country’s 7th largest corporation, have criticized what they see as a blatant effort to increase membership dues by the BSA. Membership numbers are down in general for youth groups across America so this may be less about gender and more about dough. Which reminds me, I also like the Thin Mints.

Back in August of this year, the president of the Girl Scouts sent a letter to the BSA president stating “…I formally request that your organization stay focused on serving the 90 per cent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts… and not consider expanding to recruit girls.” That, my friends, is how you win a merit badge for subtle insult.

At this point, It would be fairly easy to morph this into a high brow column about gender fluidity and the need to be considerate over what pronouns someone uses when referring to their particular identification. Or perhaps turn to the subject of gender equality and how girls and boys are really no different and so no association or organization should exclude one or the other.

But I’m a guy, raising a houseful of little guys, and so my thinking isn’t particularly complicated. I’m guessing the BSA’s decision is partly driven by a need for additional revenue, as suggested by the Girl Scouts leadership, and likely in part out of concern that they might be sued by some overly sensitive soul who wants to prove a point that most folks really don’t care about.

I admit to being a bit old fashioned. Believing that there’s a place for a Boy Scouts organization and a Girl Scouts organization that focus on their respective genders doesn’t make me a misogynist or a sexist or anything else ending in “ist” or even an “ism.” I happen to believe that there’s value and benefit in girls having their own space and boys having their own space on occasion…as long as they offer equal space and opportunity.

I know that Scooter and his pals at their current stage of life would prefer to keep the “no girls allowed” sign on their clubhouse door. And trust me, they don’t feel triggered by the idea that they can’t join the Girl Scouts. Give them a couple years and they’ll see things differently…they may even realize girls don’t find it attractive when you make farting noises. Although to be fair, I didn’t have that epiphany until my mid 20s.

Are there a significant number of girls who feel outraged over not being part of the Boy Scouts? I would have done that research but it seems like a lot of work and I’ve been busy whittling.

Apparently the leadership of the Girl Scouts isn’t inclined to think that there’s a growing demand by girls to be Boy Scouts. For their part, the BSA leadership claims the change was designed to provide more options for parents. According to BSA’s Chief Scout Executive, “We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children.”

So there you have it. Sally can now be a Cub Scout. And soon, Sally can join the Boy Scouts and eventually earn the coveted Eagle Scout award. I haven’t raised this development with Scooter yet. He may or may not care, it’s hard to tell what a 10-year-old boy’s response will be. But I’ll bet you a box of cookies there’ll be a fart noise involved.",There’s a place for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

“For the first four months of my pregnancy, my uterus was retroverted/tilted, which means that I was growing backwards into my body rather than outwards,” her caption reads.

A post shared by Yiota Kouzoukas (@yiota) on Oct 1, 2017 at 2:12am PDT

While a fetus cannot grow “backwards,” reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at CCRM Boston, Dr. Aaron Styer, points out, a backward tilt of the uterus can skew the size of a baby bump.

The common condition – affecting about one in five pregnant women – is “normal and does not increase a woman’s risk for infertility or miscarriage,” Dr. Styer says. But it is just one of the factors Kousoukas is dealing with in her pregnancy, which she explained on Instagram “for the reason of educating” people on the differences people experience during pregnancy.

“My uterus didn’t 'flip forward' until well into being 4 months pregnant because of the backwards tilted position paired with decade old endometriosis scarring that I have on my uterosacral ligaments. Basically, these ligaments are acting like anchors keeping my uterus 'inside' rather than 'outside', which is why I appeared smaller than most people for the first 4 or 5 months.”

Now the Australian influencer said she is “growing forwards” in her sixth month while “the scarring on [her] ligaments slowly breaks down.”

Kousoukas, who explains, “Social media has caused a shift that leads everyone to fixate on bump size rather than the health of the baby and mom to be,” is confident in her pregnancy and concludes her post with the important point: “I’m perfectly healthy, my baby is perfectly healthy, and that’s all that matters. Our bodies and bumps are all different and our shapes and sizes are all different too.”",Woman with medical condition shamed for baby bump,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/26/woman-with-medical-condition-shamed-for-baby-bump.html

“I know investigation is in its early stages, but we need more frequent updates on the status of investigation,” one user wrote in response to the photo.

Lombardo – the public face of the department – last appeared in front of the media on Oct. 13.

“Unfortunately, a great deal of my investigators time has been preoccupied on this timeline,” Lombardo told reporters that day after police and MGM Resorts International released conflicting information about the sequence of events on the night of the attack. “In the public space the word ‘incompetence’ has been brought forward and I am absolutely offended with that characterization.”

Despite the combative remarks, nearly a month after the shooting, which left 58 dead and hundreds more injured, dozens of questions about the attack – including ones, still, about the timeline – remain unanswered.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote in an article published Thursday that it was told twice by police that Lombardo is not conducting interviews – a stark contrast to the days after the shooting when he would appear in front of the cameras frequently, sometimes multiple times in the same day.

Las Vegas Police and a Clark County spokesman did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News at the time of publication of this article.

The lack of information also appears to be playing some role in stoking conspiracy theories, as information-starved members of the public are trying to fill in the blanks to the unresolved questions.

Some of the victims of the Oct. 1 attack have said this week they have been the target of crazed Internet trolls who claim the attack never happened.","Las Vegas shooting: 'Still not commenting' because of ongoing probe, FBI says",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/las-vegas-shooting-still-not-commenting-because-ongoing-probe-fbi-says.html

For the last year, the people of Hangzhou, China – a city of more than nine million – have had every moment of their lives tracked.

“City Brain,” an artificial intelligence system that interlinks with a city’s infrastructure was installed in October 2016, through a partnership with Alibaba and Foxconn.

In an effort to optimize Hangzhou and make urban life easier, the system tracked everything from robberies to traffic jams and learned the city’s unique patterns and needs.

Residents were also tracked through their activity on social media. Their commutes, purchases, interactions and movements were all learned and absorbed by the AI database.

“In China, people have less concern with privacy, which allows us to move faster,” Xian-Sheng Hua, an AI manager at Alibaba, said during a presentation at the World Summit AI meeting in early October.

And, according to New Scientist, the system works.

Crime, car crashes and rush hour traffic is all down. The system can predict traffic jams and adjust the traffic lights in order to avoid congestion before it begins. It can also keep track of criminals, making it easier for police to catch them. And it automatically notifies authorities when it detects so much as an illegally parked car.

The system is also hooked up to residents’ cell phones and can alert them of bad weather or traffic jams and offer safer routes.

City Brain has apparently been such a success that it’s already being packaged for other cities across China and, eventually, the world.

Instead, he led highway patrol officers on a high-speed car chase reaching speeds of almost 100 miles per hour.

The joyride -- which lasted less than an hour -- was the boy’s second in two weeks, according to Cleveland police.

A man dialed 911 after he saw a 2004 Toyota Avalon swerving across Interstate 90 west. Westlake police officers spotted a speeding car being chased by another vehicle, possible driven by the boy’s mother.

Three Westlake officers followed the boy for more than 15 miles -- with speeds reaching 100 mph -- before he drove through a toll booth and entered the Ohio Turnpike.

That’s when at least four Ohio Highway Patrol troopers joined in on the chase and attempted a rolling roadblock as the boy drove erratically along the turnpike, with the troopers close behind for close to 20 miles.

The boy eventually slowed down and drove onto a berm to avoid driving over stop sticks. One trooper then nudged the boy’s car at a slow speed into a mile post sign, and another state vehicle blocked the boy’s car, preventing him from re-entering the road.

“It was very lucky no one was hurt,” Highway Patrol Sergeant Tim Hoffman told The Associated Press.

When the child was taken into custody, he attempted to spit in the troopers' faces and even kicked one of them in the chin, WEWS reported.

The boy was taken to a hospital by a legal guardian, and will be placed in the custody of Erie County Children’s Services before being evaluated. Ohio Highway Patrol said it will confer with the Erie County Prosecutor’s Office about criminal charges.

The boy said he decided to take the family car out because he was bored, according to WEWS.

Colder weather brings us closer, but we often feel bored and irritable when the whole family is cooped up indoors. Instead of retreating to our own rooms or busying ourselves with more housework, consider starting a regular tradition for the family to enjoy together. There’s nothing quite as universally fun as a good game. Friendly competition and a lot of laughter is a recipe for a weekly family tradition that everyone will look forward to.

Dedicate a space to games and play. Now is an especially great time to get the game room ready before winter weather hits and you get snowed in for days on end. Despite the size of your space, you can always make room for fun. You could convert an attic, basement or den into a game room with some comfortable furniture, funky wall treatments and storage for toys, games and media.

Not all of us have enough space to dedicate an entire room to just games though. If not, make the most out of underused nooks by pulling up a couple of armchairs around a small table. You could also take advantage of double-duty furniture in your living room. Find a coffee table with built-in storage that makes board game setup and clean-up quick and easy. Don’t overlook decorative details either! Hang a scoreboard or stencil throw pillows with Scrabble-esque letters to instantly fun up any room.

Make it fun for everyone. The only way this will work is if everyone is having a good time. First, provide enough comfortable seating so every person feels included. Test each seat to make sure it’s positioned with a good view of the table, TV or everyone else in the room depending on what game you’re playing. A flexible seating arrangement with movable chairs and lightweight ottomans might be best.

Next, avoid making several trips up and down the stairs by keeping a variety of snacks closeby. If you have the luxury of adding a kitchenette to your room design, then go for it! Otherwise, loading up a tray or two will work just fine. Outfitting a cart with party supplies and packaged snacks can also work as a snack station for your game room. Pop some popcorn and pour drinks before you sit down to play. Preparing a snack might actually become part of your tradition. Every week you and your family can decide on a new snack to make and taste-test together, like fruit kabobs, homemade cookies or pigs in a blanket.

Lastly, allowing your kids to invite their friends to the first few game nights might be worth it. Even if you’re really looking forward to a night with the family, your kids - especially teens - might not be as keen on a night in with mom and dad. A lively group of friends for your very first game night could prove to your kids that this is a “cool” tradition to keep going.

Find the type of game you enjoy most. If game night feels forced, then it won’t be fun and it certainly won’t last long. Experiment with board games, card games, video games and even televised games to find something for everyone. If it’s a new game that you haven’t tried before make sure to spend some time reading and understanding the rules before game night begins. You’ll lose kids’ attention pretty quickly if you spend too long explaining the rules. It’s OK to have a couple of options too. Maybe two family members want to watch Monday night football while the other three play a game of Monopoly.

In 2004, Bill Gates said “two years from now, spam will be solved.” That never happened. And while the spam rate saw a steady decline after 2011, there has been an recent uptick as the maliciousness of spam has increased.

In the first half of 2017, the spam rate reached 54 percent, after bottoming out at 53 percent for both 2015 and 2016 with “all signs point to a continuation of this upward trajectory,” software security giant Symantec said in an October 2017 internet security report.

“It is a direct channel to an end user...[and] can cut a large swath through a variety of network security layers,"" Symantec added. Malicious spam can also often result in ransomware, a Symantec spokesperson told Fox News.

Enter infamous spambots

Lately, the operative word is ""malicious"" for spam arriving in your inbox.

""A lot of spam is aimed at dropping malware on your machine,"" Jonathan Penn, Director of Strategy internet security firm Avast, which offers products such as Avast Internet Security, told Fox News.

""That malware is often a botnet, and botnets are especially stealthy since their value is directly tied to how long they can remain undetected,"" Penn added.

The most widely used method to distribute malicious email is spambots, which is often part of a larger botnet – a bunch of Internet-connected devices running bots – and is “one of many tasks that the particular botnet carries out,” according to the Symantec report.

The Onliner spambot, which bypassed email filters to make it appear as though the emails were coming from legitimate sources, got a lot of attention this past summer because it inadvertently exposed its own email spamming list that included 711 million addresses.

“The social engineering is nuanced, designed to trick the recipient into clicking on the attachment, thus triggering a copy of the Ursnif Trojan to install,"" Adam Levin, chairman CyberScout LLC, a provider of internet security solutions, wrote in a blog post.

Onliner was used to deliver malware into inboxes, resulting in more than 100,000 unique infections across the world, according to a report in technology website ZDNet.

Other infamous malicious spam includes Emotet, which is often disguised as a legitimate PDF file or invoice, and the Tofsee spambot which may contain links within the emails that lead to phishing sites, “where any personal details entered are likely used for identity theft or romance scams,” according to the Symantec report.",Your spam is getting dangerous,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/27/your-spam-is-getting-dangerous.html

However if their record is expunged, and they get another DUI, that doesn't allow them to enter this pre-trial diversion again,” Kranz said. “There is no celebrity privilege here.”

That test showed no alcohol in Woods’ system, 0.0. A toxicology test, instead, showed a bunch of prescription drugs, Vicadin, Xanax, Ambien, Dilaudid as well as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Woods has had four back surgeries in the past three years, most recently fusion surgery in April.

After the arrest, Woods went to an out-of-state rehab center, which he’s tweeted helped him better manage his medications and dosages.

This week Woods tweeted out a new video, showing him hitting a “stinger”—a low, line drive, down the fairway.

Tension is gripping Spain, with the national government and Catalonia's political leaders clashing over the wealthy region's recent push to secede.

Such a standoff has never happened before and is crucial for Spain's future. ""They are approaching a cliff ... with consequences that are hard to predict right now,"" says Joan Barcelo, a researcher on political conflicts at Washington University in St. Louis.

Here is a look at the latest developments in Spain's worst political crisis in decades.

____

WHAT DOES CATALONIA WANT?

The Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona passed a motion Friday unilaterally establishing a new country. The motion was approved by the votes of pro-independence lawmakers, with 70 out of 135 votes in favor of secession. The Catalan regional government supported the breakaway bid.

Not all Catalans are keen on breaking away from Spain, however, with polls showing they are roughly evenly split. The issue has been simmering for years and boiled over when a plan to grant Catalonia, with its population of 7.5 million people, greater powers of self-government was ruled illegal by the Constitutional Court.

____

WHAT DOES THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT SAY?

The national government rejects Catalan independence, noting the constitution says Spain is ""indivisible.""

The government deployed large numbers of police to Catalonia to stop an Oct. 1 regional independence referendum, which the Constitutional Court ruled illegal. Some heavy-handed policing caused outrage among Catalans.

____

WHO WILL WIN?

The Senate on Friday granted the government extraordinary powers to end the Catalan secession drive. The government can now dismiss the Catalan regional government, dissolve its parliament and call a snap election, as well as seize control of the Catalan police force and publicly-owned media outlets.

The Catalan parliament's vote for independence was symbolic. The Spanish government intends to fire pro-independence leaders and officials, who also risk being arrested and sent to prison.

Such steps, however, will likely trigger a Catalan backlash. Resistance from public servants and regional police is probable, as are large street protests, which will keep the issue alive.

Regional elections in 2015 returned a slim majority of pro-independence lawmakers, who took this as a mandate to push ahead with the independence drive. Analysts predict a similar outcome in the upcoming ballot.","Spain, Catalonia battle to the end over independence bid",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/27/spain-catalonia-battle-to-end-over-independence-bid.html

So, why haven’t we detected, spotted, or at least heard the faint whispers of another intelligent civilization outside of Earth? A planetary scientist from Colorado’s Southwest Research Institute believes he might have the answer, and it’s literally chilling.

Speaking at a meeting of the American Astronomy Society Division for Planetary Sciences Division, Alan Stern proposed an incredible answer to the question which has long puzzled astronomers and first contact hopefuls: aliens aren’t living outside.

It sounds like total bunk to us since humans are spread across just about every nook and cranny of planet Earth, but there’s a very real possibility that life could form, evolve, and even gain advanced intelligence without ever seeing the surface of their own planet. This would be most likely on frigid ocean worlds where underwater thermal vents would provide the heat energy to sustain life, and with the sheer number of frigid ocean worlds we already know exist, there’s no shortage of opportunities for this to happen.

If an intelligent alien civilization evolved in the depths of an icy ocean world, it would be incredibly difficult for humanity to detect it, and even harder for them to contact us. In fact, even venturing to the surface of their own planet would be an incredibly difficult task, and as Stern notes, doing so would essentially be the equivalent of mankind venturing into space — a mysterious, frigid, and dangerous place.

It’s obviously very difficult for us to imagine an entire civilization of intelligent creatures living deep within the ocean, but our understanding of the requirements for life mean that it’s entirely possible. The only question is whether or not it exists somewhere out there in the vast number of unexplored worlds.",Scientist proposes wild explanation for why we haven't discovered aliens yet,http://www.foxnews.com/science/2017/10/25/scientist-proposes-wild-explanation-for-why-havent-discovered-aliens-yet.html

After the couple broke up, Swift revealed she helped write the song, angering Harris, who said she unveiled the mystery to “tear her ex-boyfriend down.”

""I know you're off tour and you need someone new to bury like Katy (Perry) ETC, but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it,” Harris tweeted.

A COSPLAY SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR COMIC CON ATTENDEES

Escape rooms have expanded across the United States from major cities like Los Angeles and New York to Birmingham and Kansas City — but the ""Jigsaw"" version might be a little bit more terrifying than most.

Jenefer Brown, Lionsgate’s SVP of Global Live and Location Based Entertainment, said that bringing a ""Saw""-themed escape room to New York Comic Con seemed logical, considering the theme of the franchise.

“More than 200,000 fans attended New York Comic Con this year,"" Brown told Fox News. ""We know from the success of the franchise that these fans are our core audience. At the same time, escape rooms have been booming. It felt like a recipe for success.”

“We wanted our fans to have a genuine emotional experience tied to Jigsaw,"" added Evan Fisk, the Vice President of Digital Marketing at Lionsgate. ""John Kramer famously gives people the chance to escape the traps he sets. Building an escape room offered a chance to let our fans experience the fun and fear of playing Jigsaw's game, without the danger.”

Fox News also got the chance to try out the ""Jigsaw""-themed attraction, and terror immediately swept over our rugged team of four. My team’s descent into madness began in a claustrophobic virtual reality room, made even smaller with a costumed Jigsaw in the corner. Each player was then attached to an ominous chain by the arm — a throwback to the original Saw movie, where the unlucky victims are chained to a wall and given a saw strong enough to chop of a foot but too weak to cut through the metal links.

Menacing chain? Check. Unsettling Jigsaw in corner? Check. Our abject terror was soon exacerbated by Jigsaw’s sinister voice delivering his instructions, and setting the gruesome scene of the impending escape room.

For a moment, we were transported back to the 1990s. There was Hillary Clinton being asked about yet another highly suspect circumstance involving gross improprieties and brazen lies and sidestepping the question by blaming that ever-present confederation: her enemies. “I think the real story is how nervous they are about these continuing investigations,” she said. “I would say it’s the same baloney they’ve been peddling for years, and there’s been no credible evidence by anyone.

A Kansas bus driver makes it her highest priority to boost the morale of the students she picks up and drops off every day.

Jan Dumcum, of Goddard, Kan., has been driving the bus in the school district for five years, KAKE reported. Dumcum’s bus, similar to many other yellow school buses on the outside, has a totally different atmosphere once you step inside.

“Everything that is up here has a purpose. I want them (the students) to feel good about themselves. I want them to feel like they can do anything,” Dumcum told KAKE.

Dumcum also keeps a bell by the door that the students ring to remind her they were going to have a “good day.”

""I decided they would announce they were going to have a good day by ringing the bell and in the evening when they rang the bell, they had a good day,"" the bus driver said.

""There are people on that street that can't give me three minutes to get my kids safely and that's very frustrating,"" the driver said.

The bus, which is currently decorated for Halloween, will also be adorned for Christmas. KAKE said the bus would be embellished with lights to help students get into the holiday spirit.

Doctors at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA Health are taking a different approach to help patients.

Instead of drugs, they’re beaming magnetic pulses deep inside a patient's brain to change the way depression symptoms are perceived. It's called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS and it's currently FDA approved to treat depression only.

""The idea [is] that by using non-chemical means we can change the brain and how it functions,"" Dr. Andrew Leuchter, director of the Semel Institute’s TMS clinical and research service, said. “By pulsing it [the brain] with energy repeatedly, we're changing the way that area works, but also changing the way the whole brain network works.""

Doctors said it could also prove helpful in a wide range of conditions like schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain, by rewiring a network of signals in the brain.

""What TMS is doing is changing how that network functions, really rebooting the network to improve symptoms of mood, anxiety and chronic pain,” Leuchter said.

Leuchter also said the newest generation of TMS equipment could make treatments less time-consuming. Patients could see treatment sessions cut from 37 minutes to 3 minutes, and can complete a full course in just two weeks.

Several patients treated with TMS for depression said the therapy also helped to relieve their pain, which raises the question about whether TMS could one day become an alternative to opioids.

""This is a really transformative kind of therapy. But, in medicine there's always the wish to do better, to help more people than what we do now,"" Dr. Ian Cook, the director of the UCLA Depression Research and Clinic Program, said.

This is exactly the kind of situation Americans feared with a President Hillary Clinton, had she won last November.
It’s true Hillary Clinton is not the president, and therefore any investigation into her or her campaign over the Steele Dossier would seem like overkill.
Hillary lost an election she should have won, handily, and she has now compromised the Russia investigation and its outcome, perhaps beyond repair.
The DNC would be best off moving on without them and the country will move forward, for better or worse, with President Trump.","Perhaps the greatest mechanism built into the founding of our Republic is the simple fact that we, as a country, and we, as a people, will stand or fall based on the decisions we make collectively at the ballot box. The power is ours alone on which leaders we choose to represent us.

In the 2016 election we just happened to narrow our choices down to two borderline octogenarians under FBI investigation and – as it was revealed earlier this week in the Washington Post – both flirting with foreign influence as their campaigns looked for even the slightest edge. Go America!

As questions were lingering over Paul Manafort and a crucial meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, former Clinton campaign operatives ran from cable news network to cable news network screaming “collusion!” – collusion with a foreign adversary none of them seemed to care about much until the 80s came calling.

Whether it’s truthful or not, representatives of the Trump campaign, including Donald Trump Jr., have stated the said meeting was set up on the premise that Veselnitskaya had information in the form of opposition research on Hillary Clinton and they felt it necessary to at least hear her out. This explanation has prompted calls for impeachment from Democrats.

The one thing the losing Clinton campaign always had going for it, we were told again and again as Hillary Clinton’s never-ending campaign morphed into the form of a book tour – is that, at the very least, neither she nor anyone on her campaign ever worked with foreign adversaries of America to secure a place in the Oval Office and history.

Clinton allegedly thought allocating campaign funds to a dossier with more holes in it than a timeline of her Benghazi whereabouts was more important than allocating them to Wisconsin or Michigan in the final weeks of the campaign.

That all went out the window earlier this week when the Washington Post reported in a blockbuster story that the infamous Steele dossier – the same one that has landed Buzzfeed in legal hot water for publishing unsubstantiated claims – was partially funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign itself.

The infamous dossier – which suggested Trump himself was compromised and open to financial blackmail by the Kremlin, resulting in collusion between the two – was a collaboration between former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele; Fusion GPS, a Clinton-linked strategic think tank firm out of D.C.; and, as revealed in the Washington Post story, party funded and researched by the Clinton campaign.

This all possibly could be written off as opposition research, but the dossier was also used, in part, as justification by a FISA court to obtain a surveillance warrant on members of the Trump campaign, and is part of an ongoing investigation into Russia’s involvement in the election by special prosecutor Robert Mueller.

Even more revealing, though, is that the FBI continued to employ and pay Steele as a source – even after the Trump dossier became public and the information it contained remained unverifiable. They did cut him loose shortly after the Buzzfeed report, but questions remain as to how this dossier played into former FBI Director James Comey’s decision-making in regards to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, and revelations that Comey himself drafted a June letter clearing Clinton of any and all possible charges, months before she was to be interviewed by investigators.

This was also months before Comey’s infamous “letter” about the FBI taking hold of Anthony Weiner’s laptop in October of 2016 – an event Clinton has pointed to as basically costing her the election. Adding on top of that Bill Clinton’s poor judgement to walk on then Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s plane on a Phoenix tarmac and you have all the makings of another Clinton “vast right wing conspiracy theory.”

The revelations of the Steele dossier’s connections to the Clinton campaign will undoubtedly undermine Mueller’s investigation going forward, and defenders of the president will, with some justification, call it nothing more than a political hit job. Trump will also no doubt exploit the fact that the investigation has now also snared up John and Tony Podesta, both closely connected to the Clintons.

Hillary has of course denied all knowledge of these developments, because of course she has, despite former campaign spokesman and political commentator Brian Fallon appearing on CNN and stating he’s not sure how much she would or would not know. It never ceases to surprise how the candidate Barack Obama called the most qualified candidate in history, apparently never has clue about the dealings of those closest to her.

The problem with all of this, obviously, is that the very same members of Clinton World who were screaming for months about collusion and treason to anyone and everywhere are now simply writing off a dossier which involved members of her campaign actually colluding with Kremlin assets (or wishing they could) as “opposition research” – while purposely deceiving the media and claiming it’s just something every campaign does, which is ironic given their claims that the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower amounted to high treason, in their eyes, and not just opposition research.

Democrats have lost the high ground with President Trump on Russia – the one parallel they used to separate their own bold claims of patriotism in the 2016 election – and once again, they have Hillary Clinton to thank for it. Clinton allegedly thought allocating campaign funds to a dossier with more holes in it than a timeline of her Benghazi whereabouts was more important than allocating them to Wisconsin or Michigan in the final weeks of the campaign.

What the disclosures in the Post also reveal are that Americans’ worst fears about Clinton at the ballot box last year proved out. Donald Trump was always the wild card, an unstable force of unpredictability – but one the country was willing to roll the dice on instead of a political oligarch whose career in the White House, Senate and as Secretary of State courted numerous scandals.

This is exactly the kind of situation Americans feared with a President Hillary Clinton, had she won last November. Nine months into her young presidency, that a scandal such as this would surface and the country would once again be dragged along for the ride – more investigations, more hearings, more whispers of impeachment. Any bold agenda she might have had would stall out and we would all once again be taken back to the future of the late 90s.

Both sides are now tainted by Russia’s meddling in the election, and any conclusions that Robert Mueller arrives at concerning the Trump campaign are almost certainly to be polluted in a cloud of whataboutism. It’s true Hillary Clinton is not the president, and therefore any investigation into her or her campaign over the Steele Dossier would seem like overkill. But she also no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt as she continues her tour across the country, fielding softball questions from late night TV hosts while simultaneously making accusations of collusion between Trump and Vladimir Putin.

If there is any excuse for the Democrats to move on from declarations of a stolen election from Team Clinton, and get back to the business of figuring out how to win elections – this would be their perfect out. Hillary lost an election she should have won, handily, and she has now compromised the Russia investigation and its outcome, perhaps beyond repair.

It’s time for Hillary Clinton and her band of campaign messengers to realize the part they too played in all of this, and kindly slink away into the dustbin that is the 2016 election. The DNC would be best off moving on without them and the country will move forward, for better or worse, with President Trump.",Hillary Clinton and Democrats lose the high ground on Russia,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/hillary-clinton-and-democrats-lose-high-ground-on-russia.html

A Missouri college that has long embraced teaching its students about military history is beginning a new, required course on patriotism.

FOX's Gurnal Scott with the story:

The College of the Ozarks in Point Lookout, Missouri is a private, Christian, liberal arts school that embraces it's uniqueness in how it values getting ""the job"" done:

(Dr. Davis) ""This is a work college. Kids work here. They don't pay tuition. They don't have to do that. We don't make loans and they graduate debt free. We to turn out citizens that will take a leadership role.""

That is why the college's president Dr. Jerry Davis says part of the school's mission has been teaching students about the military and it's importance historically in America. The College of the Ozarks is making that a new course, mandatory for incoming freshmen, called 'Patriotic Education and Fitness':

(Dr. Davis) ""We think that we need to be a little bit more intentional in teaching students about our country and about the military and what they do and why they do it.""

The course will serve to educate students on armed forces customs and protocols and touch on some political principles as well as teaching marksmanship and other survival techniques. It can serve, should a first-year student choose, as a start for reserve officers training or ROTC. Davis who has led the College of the Ozarks for nearly 30 years says Midwestern reverence for the military makes this a great fit within their curriculum:

(Dr. Davis) ""It's a part of our carrying out our patriotic goal and we think, we hope, that other schools will notice that.""

Davis says this concept couldn't come at a better time as controversy continues in stadiums across the nation over patriotism:

(Dr. Davis) ""I regret very much what's going on in the culture with regard to respect for the national anthem. Those are military students that present those colors and by extension. The country is being provided or defended by the military, so you can't say it doesn't involve the military. It does.""

In fact, the school has said its teams won't compete against other athletes that won't stand for the anthem. That's why Davis wants his school to lead the way in teaching respect for the uniform:

(Dr. Davis) ""Patriotism is not inherited by bloodstream. It must be modeled. It must be modeled, it must be taught.""

So what began as a pilot program, is growing at the College of the Ozarks as a nod to those who serve and to America itself.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, was buried Friday following private graveside services. His burial came after a funeral that drew more than 2,000 family members, friends and police and military officers, with honors that included a motorcade down the Las Vegas Strip.

The married father of two was off-duty and attending the Oct. 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from a hotel room.

LAS VEGAS SHOOTING DETAILS STILL MURKY AS MANDALAY BAY ORDERED TO KEEP EVIDENCE

However, a year before his death, Hartfield began a computer file detailing the instructions for his funeral.

“If you’re reading this, then I’ve been called home,” Hartfield’s note read. The file was found by his wife, Veronica, following his death.

“Nothing I type will make this any easier, so I will get to the facts. My largest request: Please do not allow anyone to wear black. Black is totally depressing and I don’t want anyone expressing their sorrow over my passing,” Hartfield’s instructions read.

Hartfield asked that Nina Simone and Johnny Cash songs also be played during his funeral.

“I would like for everyone to enjoy themselves. And remember me for who I was. The truth only. None of that stuff about how great I was. Only real stories,” the officer wrote.

Everyone broke that rule over the next hour.

Friends, his cousin, brother and sister, and police and military officials including Brig. Gen. Zachary Doser, the head of the Nevada Army National Guard, characterized the man most called ""Chucky"" as an inspiration, a mentor and a quick wit.

Doser praised Hartfield, who at age 34 had accumulated 17 years of military service in Iraq and with a quartermaster unit in the Nevada Guard, as the epitome of ""everything good about being an American.""

Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo called Hartfield, an 11-year police veteran, a “remarkable officer” killed by “an unremarkable person.”

Investigators have not determined what motivated the shooter, Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired accountant, real estate investor and high-stakes gambler, to plan and execute his attack.

Lombardo said Hartfield 's death was considered on-duty because he tried to shield, protect and shepherd people in a concert crowd from danger.

""That night, in a hail of gunfire, Charlie's last actions spoke for him,"" Lombardo said. ""He took actions to save lives.""

Hartfield asked to be buried in a veteran’s area so he could continue to “protect” the U.S. with the other buried veterans.

“The only way I would like to be placed in the ground is if it’s in a veteran’s area. That way myself and the crusty old vets can hold formations and continue to protect and serve our great country once more,” Hartfield wrote.

The head of the Democratic Party suggested as much during a forum at the University of Chicago earlier this week.

While defending the Fusion GPS dossier as standard opposition research, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez maintained he only learned about the dossier “a few days ago” – before explaining how his predecessors at the DNC could have set up such a project.

“You hire a lawyer – and we hire lawyers all the time who hire third-party vendors to do their work – and so we knew that we were paying for opposition research at the DNC, but we didn’t ask questions about who they’re hiring in the context of doing their research,” Perez told The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty, when asked to explained how he could have been in the dark.

Perez, who was not at the DNC at the time, went on to defend the party’s efforts, saying “we had very strong reason to believe that Donald Trump and the Donald Trump campaign and the Russians were potentially conspiring to affect the election.”

The controversial dossier contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on then-candidate Donald Trump and his campaign’s possible connections to Moscow.

The Washington Post reported this earlier week — and Fox News confirmed — that the political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

DEMS' DOSSIER DENIALS PILE UP

According to the report, the Clinton campaign and DNC paid more than $9 million to Elias’ firm Perkins Coie that, in turn, retained the political consultants who commissioned the research. Before that, the research was backed by an unknown Republican client.

But it’s unclear how much of that $9 million went toward the dossier. And it’s unclear who exactly at the Clinton campaign and DNC might have known how it was being spent.

Perez and then-DNC leader Debbie Wasserman Schultz have denied knowledge. So have Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman John Podesta and spokesman Brian Fallon. And while Clinton herself has not spoken publicly on the matter, sources have sought to distance her from the dossier in news reports.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime” that the careful distance between the research and the political entities that helped fund it only underscores the need to “connect the dots.”

“There were so many in-between groups used to sort of shield direct control that it’s very clear that people on the one end, Russia, and on the other end, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign – they obviously wanted to create the inability to connect the dots. And when somebody goes through so many efforts through so many surrogates to keep that from happening, you have a special reason to want to connect the dots,” he said Thursday.

To what extent Russia might have been involved is unclear.

But more details could emerge soon, as Fusion GPS fights in court to keep its bank records on lockdown.

Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel wrote that the disclosure of the DNC-Clinton connection suggests “there's something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more” in those records.

“If the House wins, don't be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.'s office,” Strassel wrote.

President Trump has reveled in the recent revelations – including renewed scrutiny of a 2010 Obama-era uranium deal involving a Russian firm – using them to fuel his claims that the investigations into Russian collusion with his campaign are baseless.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” Trump tweeted Friday.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on “Fox & Friends” that she doesn’t know which GOP candidate started backing Fusion but said Steele only got involved after the Democrats stepped in.

“Democrats have not been transparent or honest about how this started,” she said Friday.

In another twist, CNN reported that former Clinton campaign chairman Podesta privately denied any knowledge of the payment arrangement in recent interviews with congressional investigators. According to the report, sitting next to Podesta during that September interview was his attorney Marc Elias – who retained Fusion.",'We didn't ask questions': Fusion GPS link to Dems murky by design,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/didnt-ask-questions-fusion-gps-link-to-dems-murky-by-design.html

The bill aims to close a loophole which currently leaves models open to potential harassment on the job from people such as photographers, designers and agency employees, Moneyish reports. Because models are typically classified as independent contractors, they are often excluded from standard employment protections, but this bill would provide them protection against sexual harassment.

“There’s no accountability when it comes to who ultimately has to respond to sexual harassment in the workplace,” Rozic said to Moneyish. “The bill addresses this loophole in the law by making it an unlawful practice for a modeling entity — whether it be this talent agency or management company — to subject a model to harassment, regardless of whether they’re an independent contractor or employee.”

Rozic’s bill, which was developed with New York-based advocacy group Model Alliance, would hold modeling agencies accountable for misconduct on the job.

Emma Rodriguez, 27, had faced life in prison without parole. She pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence, according to reports.

The magazine is under fire after publishing an opinion piece this week titled ""Why are all the conservative loudmouths Irish-American?""

The article, written by Van Gosse, a history professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Penn., was published Monday and seeks to explain how “putative Irishmen” such as former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and ex-White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon “are now the face of the hard Right.”

“Why has the ascent of a bunch of people who in an earlier period might have been called Micks drawn no notice at all?” wrote Gosse, who said he is a quarter Irish-American on his father’s side.

He said the rise of the likes of Buchanan and Bannon, as well as Fox News’ Sean Hannity, are not accidental. Gosse links it to former U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who in the 1950s fueled fears of widespread Communism.

Gosse wrote, that by the 1960s, Irish Catholics, once in the periphery of American society, had “finally made it and become fully ‘white.’”

“Having fought their way to full inclusion, many were intent on pulling up the drawbridge,” he wrote.

“Jump forward to the present…Irish America has lost virtually all its distinctive qualities, becoming just one more version of whiteness colored by ethnicity,” Gosse wrote, adding someone saying they are “Irish Catholic” is like saying they are “Midwestern.”

“The only thing “Irish” about them is a talent for invective, which makes for a compelling style, a mix of pugnacity and certainty,” Gosse continued. “They are smart, articulate, and not at all embarrassed, especially when their opinions are vicious.”

Readers were quick to point out the bias in Gosse’s words, some calling the piece “racist” and demanding Newsweek apologize to Irish-Americans.

“Some major bigotry going on here. What was newsweek thinking publishing racist diatribe?!?” one reader commented.

Another wrote: “This reads like an old fashioned Wasp wishing the Irish knew their place.”

“I'm second generation Irish American on my father's side,"" another critic commented. ""I'm not usually bothered by Irish stereotypes. But this article is so dripping with ignorance it's jaw dropping and utterly offensive. Replace the word 'Irish' with any other ethnicity and it would never have gone to print and/or the author would've been fired. I'm stunned that a person of such ignorance is allowed to teach.”

Gosse and Newsweek did not immediately respond to Fox News’ requests for comment.

After essentially starting since their freshman year, the trio helped the Wildcats return to the NCAA Tournament last season, knocking off Wake Forest in an opening-round game. And now, they are back for their junior seasons as the unquestioned leaders of a team with higher aspirations.

""They are going to have to play like seniors, with consistency,"" Weber said. ""Our little quote for the summer was, `If you never wake up with something to prove, you will never improve.' We have talked about that all summer, and to me there is no doubt they have improved. Now we have to show it.""

The Wildcats certainly have pieces to replace from last year's 21-14 finish.

Wesley Iwundu grew from a quiet role player into an NBA draft pick. D.J. Johnson provided size and scoring in the paint. Carlbe Ervin II was a solid perimeter defender. Austin Budke was the gritty, overachieving forward. And when Isaiah Maurice was kicked out of the program for violating team rules, it left a gaping hole inside that the Wildcats must patch up with transfers and freshmen.

But when you combine the Wildcats' junior trio with Xavier Sneed, who played meaningful minutes as a freshman, and redshirts Cartier Diarra and forward James Love III, there is plenty of experience.

There are also plenty of newcomers to fill in the roster.

Six-eight forward Mawdo Sallah is a graduate transfer from Mt. St. Mary's, and Makol Mawien is a 6-9 forward from New Mexico Junior College. They'll be joined by incoming prospects Nigel Shadd and Levi Stockard to give the Wildcats plenty of big bodies in the paint.

The Wildcats will also try to mix junior college transfer Amaad Wainright, a 6-4 guard, and top-100 prospect Mike McGuirl into the mix to give the veterans on the perimeter a breather.

""This year's team is going to be competitive,"" Brown said. ""We have a lot of flexible guys that can play multiple positions. We're going to be athletic, long, shoot the 3 at a higher efficiency and get to the basket. I feel that we are going to improve in every statistic.""

Including wins, the only one that ultimately matters.

As the Wildcats prepare for the season, here are some of the key story lines:

TOURNEY EXPERIENCE

The Wildcats played poorly in their NCAA Tournament loss to Cincinnati, but the experience was still beneficial. They had missed out on playing in it back-to-back years.

""It was real motivational,"" said Stokes, who led the Wildcats in assists last year. ""We know we can get there and we just have to get these new guys on board so we can get back to that point.""

BRUCE'S CONTRACT

Weber agreed to a two-year extension in August that could keep him with the Wildcats through the 2020-21 season. It was the first major personnel move by new Kansas State athletic director Gene Taylor, and an important vote of confidence for a coach who had been on the hot seat.

SCHEDULE PREVIEW

Kansas State opens Nov. 10 against American, and has high-profile non-conference games against Arizona State, Vanderbilt, Washington State and Georgia. Then comes the double-round robin Big 12 schedule, which includes a three-game stretch against Kansas, West Virginia and Texas.

THE DEAN

Brown and Stokes get a lot of attention for being flashy perimeter scorers, but it may be the 6-8 Wade who needs to take the biggest step this season. He averaged 9.3 points and 4.5 rebounds last season, but there are some who think he could be a regular double-double guy.

""I see someone who was not aggressive enough, offensively and defensively, especially in rebounding,"" he acknowledged, ""but I also see a ton of room to grow. Hopefully this offseason I have grown enough to expand my game.""

X MARKS THE SPOT

Sneed arrived at Kansas State with more prep credentials than anyone, and there were times that he showed his promise. But after pouring in 17 points in his college debut, he struggled to have consistent success, failing to reach double figures in his final 10 games.

""This year showing my all-around game, being able to shoot, attack the hole and play defense is a big key for me,"" he said.

Freedom isn't free -- it costs about $7,500.

That's the price for one of the giant American flags that take center-stage at sporting events around the country, a constant symbol of patriotism even amid the controversy surrounding some NFL players' decision to kneel during the national anthem.

“Even watching it on TV I still get tears in eyes and a lump in my throat,” Amy Barnett, who runs 50 Star Productions – one of the companies that rents out the flags -- told Fox News. “I love the patriotic-ness of it. The crowd loves it so much, it’s amazing.”

A post shared by Gene Michael Arciniaga (@snowboardgene) on Oct 22, 2017 at 10:03pm PDT

The Salt Lake City-based company said it has been booked for at least 120 games this year with sports teams paying around $4,000 to $7,500 to showcase the giant flags that are delivered in 14 pieces.

“Each stripe is a piece and the union is a single, solid piece,” Barnett said. The pieces are attached together to create huge American flags – some the size of entire football fields weighing 1,200 pounds – that require more than 100 volunteers to hold.

“We traditionally utilize the large flag for big games – Opening Day, 4th of July, Postseason Games, as it is a great part of the tradition of big baseball games,” Joe Jareck, director of public relations for the Los Angeles Dodgers, told Fox News.

The baseball team has been displaying American flags this week that stretch from foul line to foul line as the national anthem played during the opening two games of the World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Houston Astros have used the flag in a similar fashion during their 2017 postseason run.

“The big flag requires more than 100 volunteers to rehearse and unfurl the flag at the assigned time in pre-game,” Jareck said.

The displays – big and small -- are carrying over to football stadiums as well, in cities such as Philadelphia, Denver and Indianapolis.

“We have been displaying the full-field flag during the National Anthem prior to our home games since our last season in the RCA Dome [in 2008],” Pete Ward, chief operating officer of the Indianapolis Colts, told Fox News. “We have no plans to stop doing so.”

And at high school football homecoming games across the country, teams are also joining in on the surge of patriotism, with a viral video of a flag-filled pre-game ceremony by a California team racking up more than six million views on Facebook.

The Burroughs High School football team in Ridgecrest walking onto the field with each player carrying American flags – with Lee Greenwoods “God Bless the USA” playing in the background – was a “very emotional display,” head coach Todd Mather said.

“There wasn’t a dry eye in the stands,” he told Fox News. “We never realized it would be this big.”

The school’s athletic director, Michele Lazaro, described Ridgecrest as a “very patriotic town” with a nearby Navy base, whose planes did a flyover for the game.

The revelation has sparked a frenzy among Republicans who have called for more information on just how involved former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the production of the unverified dossier.

Here’s what to know about the firm and its connection to the Russia investigations.

What is Fusion GPS?

Founded by veteran journalists, Fusion GPS “provides premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms and investors worldwide,” according to its sparse website.

The Washington, D.C.-based firm also says it offers a “cross-disciplinary approach with expertise in media, politics, regulation, national security, and global markets.”

Fusion GPS was started in 2009 by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson.

How is Fusion GPS linked to the Russia investigation?

The political firm was behind the controversial dossier that contained a number of colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump. The company retained British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who produced the 35-page dossier.

FUSION GPS LINK TO DEMOCRATS MURKY BY DESIGN

While it has not been verified, the dossier, which included explicit sexual and financial allegations against Trump, created further speculation about any Trump connection to Russian officials – a question that has dogged his campaign and presidency.

Who funded the dossier?

The firm was originally retained during the election by an unidentified client who wanted opposition research on Trump. While the donor has not been identified, the president told Fox Business that he believes he knows who it is.

After Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, Clinton and the DNC retained Fusion GPS through lawyer Marc Elias and his firm, Perkins Coie, Fox News confirmed.

Clinton reportedly did not know about the dossier until BuzzFeed News published it in January 2017. Democrats have defended it as simply opposition research.

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time Perkins Coie hired them, or how much money was involved in the transaction. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Perkins Coie more than $9 million – although it’s uncertain how much of that money, if any, went toward the dossier.

The Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the project until October 2016 – right before the election.

Trump has suggested that the dossier was funded by Russia, Democrats, the FBI or all of them.

Anything else?

Simpson has done substantial investigative work on the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after reporting a massive tax fraud scheme. Magnitsky died in prison, and the U.S. enacted the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on certain Russian officials.

During the campaign, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, took a controversial meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton. Instead, those who went to the meeting said she just wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act.

In his investigative work on Magnitsky, Simpson may have found evidence that contradicts details of the case accepted by the U.S., NBC News reported.

Fusion GPS also did work as a firm related to the Magnitsky Act.

Following a Cabinet meeting, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he is dissolving the parliament and will hold new regional elections in Catalonia in December.

Catalonia’s regional parliament passed a motion earlier Friday to establish itself as an independent Catalan Republic.

Immediately after the independence decision, Spain's Senate authorized the government to invoke a never-before used constitutional measure to take control of the Catalonia region. The measure gives Spain the ability to sack Catalonia President Carles Puigdemont and his Cabinet as well as authorize the government to curtail the region's parliamentary powers.

Catalonia's motion called for beginning an independence process that would include drafting Catalonia’s new laws as well as open negotiations “on equal footing” with Spanish authorities.

What is Catalonia?

Located in the northeast region of Spain, Catalonia is largely independent with its own culture and language. It’s one of the richest and most industrialized areas of the country with a heavy emphasis on manufacturing, according to the BBC.

The region, which includes Barcelona, is home to about 7.5 million people.

Valuing its autonomy, Catalonia has its own parliament and executive, called “Generalitat” in its language.

Why do they want independence?

Because of its own cultural identity, those in favor of Catalan independence have pushed for the region to become separate from Spain. Supporters also believe that they have given more to the Spanish government than they have gotten back.

The push for independence “raises questions of the future of democracy and democratic rule,” Pamela Radcliff, a University of California, San Diego professor and modern Spain historian, told Fox News. “What’s being contested between Spain and Catalonia, one of the things is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.”

TOP EU OFFICIALS RALLY BEHIND SPANISH PM OVER CATALAN POLL

The push for independence is led by Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia. The region held a referendum on Oct. 1.

Tens of thousands of people gathered in the streets of Barcelona around the Catalan regional government palace to celebrate the independence vote Friday. They chanted for the Spanish flag to be removed as live music played.

The region’s parliament voted to establish an independent Catalonia with 70 votes in favor of independence, 10 votes against and two blank ballots. Opposition leaders had left the chambers in protest before the vote.

How did the earlier vote go?

About 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who cast votes chose independence, Catalan officials said of the disputed referendum. However, fewer than half of eligible voters participated in the Oct. 1 vote.

About 900 people were treated for injuries after voting turned violent when Catalan civilians and Spanish police clashed earlier this month.

Andrew Dowling, an expert in Catalan history at Cardiff University in Wales, said that an independence declaration by the Catalan parliament is symbolic without border and institutional control and no international support.

The declaration ""will see the fracture between hardliners and the pragmatic people in Catalonia who are already seeing an economic fallout,"" Dowling told The Associated Press.

What has been Spain’s response?

Spain's top court declared the Oct. 1 independence referendum illegal, and Rajoy had warned that the government’s first move will be to remove Puigdemont from power when the Senate granted him the special powers under Article 155.

Rajoy said what is happening in Catalonia is “a clear violation of the laws, of democracy, of the rights of all, and that has consequences.”

CATALONIA VOTERS PROTEST AGAINST VIOLENT POLICE TACTICS AFTER INDEPENDENCE VOTE

Rajoy has reportedly refused help from outside civil-society groups and lawyers to mediate negotiations between the two factions. He has also declined to engage in talks with Catalan leaders.

“There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience and unlawfulness,” Rajoy said.

Radcliff said that “it’s very possible” that neither side has “much incentive to compromise.”

What is Article 155?

Spain invoked a clause of its constitution after Catalonia forged ahead with its plans to secede from the country that would take away the region’s autonomy.

Catalonia's refusal to backtrack from its independence threats triggered Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the government said, which allows central authorities to take over control of any of the country’s 17 regions. It’s a provision that hasn’t been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in the European nation.

An English translation of the constitution states that should an autonomous community break the law or disregard the constitution, the Spanish government can – after following certain procedures – “take the measures necessary in order to compel the [community] forcibly to meet said obligations, or in order to protect [Spain’s] general interests.”

Rajoy's cabinet met in a special meeting last week to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155. The Senate gave him the power to do so on Friday.

But a cold dose of reality is not far off, as the federal government of Spain decides how harshly to deal with its rebellious citizens.

Catalonians hopped happily in the streets of their region’s capital, Barcelona, waving the banner of independence and swigging cava, the delightful local version of champagne. For them, independence is a sweet-sounding dream. They’ve been part of Spain since the 15th Century, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella married and united their lands. But Catalonia has its own language, history and traditions, and its relationship with the federal government in Madrid has always been uneasy.

For the rest of Spain, the declaration of independence is an insult to national honor. It is the equivalent of California unilaterally declaring that it is a separate country now, because its citizens don’t like President Trump. The Spanish senate declared the breakaway illegal and Catalonia’s pro-independence government illegitimate.

How tough a stand Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy decides to take against Catalonia will probably determine if what is now a dicey political situation becomes physically violent. When Catalonians tried to hold a referendum on the question of independence earlier this month, Rajoy sent the national police to disrupt the election, which he called illegal. Police smashed their way into polling stations, confiscated ballots and roughed up hundreds of would-be voters.

That infuriated Catalonians, many of whom now say they’re ready to defend their homeland with defiance, if necessary. The specter of armed police streaming into Catalonia to put down what has so far been a peaceful protest should make all Spaniards, and Europeans for that matter, act with extreme caution.

It’s unlikely that any European countries will recognize Catalonia as a sovereign state. To do so would open the door to a further dismantling of what is – in name, anyway – the European Union. Already, Britain has voted to leave. It could be just a matter of time until Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly against Brexit, decides it no longer wants to be part of the United Kingdom. The Czech Republic just elected a prime minister who dislikes centralized control from Brussels. And in Italy, the populist Northern League has set itself firmly in opposition to European control over them.

For all the dancing in the streets that Catalonians are doing now, tough days of reckoning are coming. The European Union is, in one respect, like the Mafia: once you join, you can’t leave. Or, if you try to, you’re going to pay a heavy price.","Spain on the brink: The EU has a brutal streak.

An offshoot of the Women’s March, a protest that hit the streets following Donald Trump’s inauguration last January and led by radical activist Linda Sarsour, the Women’s Convention in Detroit features prominent progressive activists and Democratic Party politicians.

Among the big-name legislators, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, are set to make appearances. Democratic PAC EMILY'S List President Stephanie Schriock was also scheduled to speak.

However, proclamations of liberation and support for women’s rights have not been followed by some of the convention’s confirmed speakers, who have expressed anti-women views and made borderline anti-Semitic comments.

Seydi Sarr, a self-proclaimed social justice activist in Detroit, once refused to condemn the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) as “heinous and barbaric” during a discussion about a Michigan doctor who is charged with performing FGM on around 100 minors in a Muslim sect.

“Well, is male circumcision heinous and barbaric?” Sarr asked in response to a FOX2 Detroit journalist’s question about whether she considers FGM performed on girls brutal and backward. “Commonly, (male circumcision) not seen as being heinous and barbaric and people grow commonly in general to accept male circumcision as not being heinous and barbaric,” she said.

In the same interview, she also failed to agree that performing FGM should be a crime in the U.S. “It's not about thinking shouldn't it be a crime or not be prosecuted,” she said, adding the issue of whether the practice must remain criminal “is not even being discussed.”

Dr Zuhdi Jasser, President of American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD), called Sarr’s equation of female genital with male circumcision “absurd” and “offensive” in an interview with Fox News.

“FGM is FGM. Even the identification of it as circumcision is abhorrent to me. Not only as a Muslim, but as a physician. It’s not circumcision,” said Jasser, an expert on FGM.

Sarr did not respond to Fox News’ requests for a comment.

Zahra Billoo, an executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and another speaker at the convention, voiced seemingly hateful views towards Israel and those supporting it, going as far as to say “I don't think we can work on civil rights together in the US” if someone supports Israel, which she called “baby killers.”

CAIR has long been accused of being an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and was named in 2007 along with 300 other organizations as an unindicted co-conspirator in a case on funding extremist group Hamas in Gaza.

“I'm more afraid of racist Zionists who support Apartheid Israel than of the mentally ill young people the FBI recruits to join ISIS,” Billoo, a close friend of Sarsour, wrote on social media, floating a conspiracy that the FBI recruits young people to join the Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq.

Billoo did not respond multiple requests for a comment.

Another confirmed speaker at the Women’s Convention in Detroit is Rosa Clemente – an activist who was Green Party Cynthia McKinney’s running mate during the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

She has followed Billoo’s lead in attacking the Jewish state and made numerous anti-women remarks as well as blaming white women for perpetuating “racism/patriarchy” for staying silent about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s sexual harassment allegations.

“Yes white women sure did do that. They are awful,” Clemente wrote after a social media user pointed out that Trump got elected with women’s votes. In another tweet, she said she will not attack non-voters for Clinton’s defeat in the election, adding: “I will blame the secret white women racist vote, not so secret anymore.”

Despite criticizing Trump for misogyny, Clemente also described Hillary Clinton as “anti-feminist, Wall Street-loving, coup-facilitating, Zionist-loving warmonger,” in a tweet dated January 2016.

Recently, she criticized “white women” for attacking the leaders of the Women’s March, saying that the same white women were “silent for decades regarding Weinstein” and perpetuate “racism/patriarchy.”

Clemente responded to a request for a comment, but did not address the comments she made on social media, instead accusing this reporter of “editorializing” and saying that she does not “explain myself in any regard when it comes to Fox News.”

The remarks from the speakers could cause concern for attending Democratic legislators, such as Stabenow and Gillibrand, who always affirmed their unequivocal support for the Jewish state.

“My record makes it clear that I am one of the strongest and most consistent supporters of Israel in the Senate,” Gillibrand wrote in the Forward magazine, adding that “Israel is one of the most vibrant democracies in the world.”

Fox News has reached out to the Democratic lawmakers and other Israel supporters participating in the convention, revealing the comments made by the speakers. Only one response has been received condemning the attitudes.

Last year, Sony Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai said at a strategy briefing that the company was in the process of developing “a robot capable of forming an emotional bond with customers and able to grow to inspire love and affection.”

Sony sold about 150,000 AIBOs between 1999 and 2006 for between $600 and more than $2,000, the Journal said. The robots came with artificial intelligence allowing them to greet its owner, play with a ball, dance and sing songs.

The new pet robots will have smoother movements and improved motors and sensors. They may also include internet connectivity allowing the pooch to learn new tricks and control appliances.

It’s about our national defense. The judge’s decision will decide the state of discipline on battlefields for decades to come. Bergdahl has been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He has pleaded guilty to both charges.

There are no mitigating circumstances.

He must be punished, for his crimes and to make an example of him.

Yet, the American left, which has had only two military heroes since 9/11 (Bergdahl and Chelsea Manning), continues to embrace Bergdahl’s very tall tale that he only meant to stroll a dozen or so miles through hostile territory to the next military base so he could report on conditions is his unit—which Bergdahl found unsatisfactory. Based upon the evidence available to this writer, Bergdahl intended to go over to the enemy, whom he had expected to welcome him.

Bergdahl will never be commemorated for his judgment or analytical skills.

The left, exemplified by former President Obama’s White House celebration for the Bergdahls after he gave up five terrorists and, reportedly, cash for their traitor-son, has never grasped why anyone would join our military—a domain of brutes, illiterates, psychopaths and “deplorables.” But leftists do understand why soldiers would desert or betray our country by revealing our secrets.

The heaviest sentence that could be imposed upon Bergdahl is life in prison—to make the point to all those contemplating such crimes in the future that there will be grave penalties.

It matters not in the least to those who believe this country is not worth defending that honorable service members were gravely wounded in the stop-everything-else search for Bergdahl that paralyzed our war effort in Afghanistan. And it certainly doesn’t matter that those who were on the ground and involved in that hunt believe that as many as six of their comrades died looking for a man whom our military knew from the start was a deserter (a four-star general confirmed it to me within 48 hours of Bergdahl’s desertion, but would not say so publicly—a moral coward who, ironically, got his own comeuppance a few years later).

All that matters now for the left is that Bergdahl “suffered enough” during his five years under Taliban control.

Of course, those wounded because of him will suffer all of their lives. The dead will never return to those they love. But none of that matters. For the left, that military judge must let Bergdahl go free on humanitarian grounds—thus redeeming Obama’s festive Rose Garden welcome for Ma and Pa Taliban.

Certainly, one can make the case that Bergdahl was a feckless, self-absorbed loser unsuited to the brotherhood of arms (another phenomenon the left can’t grasp). But this case isn’t about punk psychology, but about overt and treacherous behavior. Nor was Bergdahl some hapless draftee of the sort mythologized from Vietnam. He volunteered to serve in uniform.

And the crime he committed, deserting his post in a tactical combat zone, is the second-worst a soldier can perpetrate—the worst being turning your weapon on your comrades. Even had no one been wounded or killed in our efforts to retrieve Bergdahl, he betrayed a fundamental trust and endangered those who counted on him to do his part in their mutual defense.

We cannot defend our country with a military in which soldiers decide to walk away because they’ve had a mood swing.

One need feel no personal animus toward Bergdahl to recognize that the proper punishment for his misdeeds would be the death penalty (his behavior condemned better men to death). But we no longer punish deserters that way.

The heaviest sentence that could be imposed upon Bergdahl is life in prison—to make the point to all those contemplating such crimes in the future that there will be grave penalties.

And the judge can choose that sentence in easy conscience, aware that the next Democratic president will pardon Bergdahl (at which point, Mr. Bergdahl could wed Ms. Chelsea Manning, late of Harvard Yard, and live happily ever after).

But the judge is also evaluating whether President Trump’s campaign remarks on Bergdahl make it impossible for the defendant to get a fair trial. Should the judge dismiss the case on those grounds, he would be saying that he lacked the faculties to make up his own mind based upon the evidence.

But in this frivolous age, when political correctness has infected our military from bottom to top, from destroying the brilliant folk poetry of traditional cadence calls to establishing lightly masked quotas for promotion based upon race and gender, there is a real possibility that, one way or another, Bergdahl, betrayer of the military’s sacred trust, will walk away a free man. (His lawyer was smart enough to recommend that Bergdahl choose a trial by judge and not by a jury of his peers—peers who would have inquired about the feasibility of drawing and quartering).

The judge, an Army colonel, is independent, as he should and must be. And this is by far the most important case of his career. One hopes he is aware that he’s not deciding the future of one man who betrayed his comrades, but the state of military discipline for generations to come.

You may have heard of, or even created, a home inventory before. This record, often used to document belongings for insurance purposes, can also be a really helpful tool if you are trying to declutter, prepare for emergencies, clear space for a remodel or just get organized. Check out these tips to create a thorough home inventory and streamline your belongings at the same time.

Make Your Inventory

Choose your checklist. The first step in making a home inventory is getting your hands on a comprehensive checklist — one from your own insurance company is best. Review the checklist before getting started.

Work through your home, room by room. Following your checklist, work your way slowly through the entire house — you may want to divvy up the task over several weekends. Record a brief description of each item, how many you have, how much it cost and the year you purchased it.

Don't leave out any nooks or crannies. Craft rooms, sheds, attics, workshops, porches and garages should all be carefully examined and documented.

Supplement with photos or video. Using digital photos is one option, but you may find it easier to create a video tour of your home to document your belongings. Whether you are taking photos or video, start at the front and work your way through each room — try to go in the same order used on your checklist.

Add a storage map. Noting down where exactly in the house everything is stored can be incredibly useful when you need to find something, whether it's an emergency or just time to hang the Christmas lights.

Use an actual floor plan if you have one; if not, you can create your own simple sketch of each floor of your house. Being as specific as possible, note where in each room boxes or other items are stored.

Keep paperwork in one place. Gather receipts, credit card statements, appraisal documents and the like, and keep them bundled with your other home inventory materials.

Even better, take the time to scan everything and store the digital archive in at least two places.

Use Your Home Inventory to Declutter

Get rid of unnecessary multiples. Cutting back on excess multiples can free up a lot of space in your home, but actually getting rid of unneeded things is easier said than done. Your home inventory checklist can make things easier by providing emotional distance.

Read over your list and mark any items you have a lot of. Do you really need all of those extra dishes? Start a list of things you want to sell or donate.

Highlight valuable items. Especially note valuable pieces you've been holding onto for a long time but are not necessarily using. Do online research and estimate what you could sell the pieces for. Would you rather have the extra space and money? If so, let those pieces go!

Mark your calendar for a big junk toss. You know that stuff you've been meaning to toss but haven't found the motivation to? We all have it. Now that you know exactly what and where yours is, set a date to (finally) take care of it.

Get prepared by researching where you can take it — things in good condition may be candidates for donation, while others may need to be dropped at a special recycling center. Involving a reward at the end of your day of errands is always a good plan!

Box everything. Now that you've cleared out space in your storage areas, think about ways to make your storage really work for you. One simple but effective strategy is to tuck every single item in storage — whether in closets, cupboards or in deep storage — into a box or bin.

Containers instantly make things look neater, and it's also easier to shift items around or grab a box you need rather than trying to unload armfuls of loose stuff from a shelf.

Use storage for rotating items too. Free up space in cupboards, closets, shelves and counters for the items you actually use daily, and pack away the rest. This is one of the best ways to make your life easier, without getting rid of a drastic amount of stuff. Simply rotate in fresh dishes, linens and decorative items seasonally.

RELATED: Storage Cabinets That Fit Your Every Need

Consider digital backups. Creating digital backups (photos or scans) of important paper records, photos, kids’ art and other memorabilia can offer peace of mind. For less sentimental items, you may choose to actually toss the originals and keep only the digital record.

Remember to also …

Update your inventory. Anytime you buy something new or get rid of something on your list, pull out that inventory and note the change. If it’s something new you are adding, use this as a cue to look for a similar item on your inventory to get rid of. It’s much easier to keep clutter at bay than deal with it after things have gotten out of hand.

Havana starts on the Malecon, the elegant, crumbling coastal boulevard whose early 20th-century buildings face a sea that sprays them with salt and pounds them with massive waves brought in by cold fronts or hurricanes.

That sea is warming and rising. The hurricanes are getting wetter and more intense. Along with a lack of maintenance, climate change is pushing the Malecon toward collapse.

Seventy percent of the buildings along the oldest, most fabled stretch of the Malecon have deteriorated so badly that they require partial or total demolition, according to one recent study. And at least four other buildings are in the process of being demolished after floodwaters lingered on the island last month, highlighting the many signs of the trouble faced by Cuba and the wider Caribbean in an age of rising temperatures.

Cuban experts predict the Malecon may not be able to last in its current form beyond 2100, when waters along Havana's northern coast may rise as much as three feet, bringing larger waves and potentially catastrophic flooding.

""It's hard to think that the Malecon will survive as such,"" said architect Rolando Lloga, who has written a report on the boulevard and suggests eliminating many buildings and joining it with the next street over. ""Nature is moving faster than the actions that are underway.""

After Irma scraped the northern coast of Cuba from Sept. 8 to 10, killing 10 people, the Malecon was closed for three weeks due to cave-ins on the six-lane roadway, sidewalk and seawall, where tens of thousands of Cubans usually sit, drink, eat and enjoy breezes off the Florida Straits.

The 5-mile Malecon was built atop coral reefs and mangrove forests that once provided a buffer between the sea and inland areas. Because of its inherently exposed position, many of the buildings along the stretch have elevated entrances and other features meant to accommodate flooding.

But those early adaptive measures are already getting an update. Cuba is in the middle of a broad rethinking of its land-use and urban planning policies, which include limiting the size of buildings on the Malecon, rebuilding its seawall with a water-shedding curve, building wave-breaking structures along the coast, and changing the drainage and sewage system so that seawater doesn't enter and erode the Malecon from below.

Still, that may not be enough. While hundreds of historic and cultural landmarks around Latin America are threatened by climate change, neglect has left the Malecon in worse shape than most.

A January report by the Havana Historian's Office found that 52 of the 72 buildings along the oldest stretch, what's known as the traditional Malecon, are in poor condition and would require demolition.

Of the 726 apartments in buildings on the traditional Malecon, which is home to 2,555 people, only 46 were in good condition, according to the report. Ninety-eight were deemed ""normal,"" 162 were ""bad"" and 420 were ""terrible.""

Thirty buildings were previously demolished between 1994 and 2013, according to the report.

For now, demolished buildings will be left as empty lots until the Cuban government finds the funds to build new, climate-adapted structures. Cuban regulations make new private construction virtually impossible, particularly in historic areas.

""The sea will always seek what belonged to it, and we have to find a balance in order to live together, in order to enjoy this public space,"" said Patricia Rodriguez, director of the office of the city historian's master plan.

Previous requirements for the major included two courses in “Major English Poets,” including Chaucer, Shakespeare, Donne, Milton and Eliot, among others. But that two-course series petitioners had deemed actively harmful due to its focus on white male poets. The series is no longer a graduation requirement for Yale’s English majors.

The petition, a Google document which has since been made private, critiqued the perceived whiteness of the English department requirements: “A year spent around a seminar table where the literary contributions of women, people of color, and queer folk are absent actively harms all students, regardless of their identity.”",Yale 'Decolonizes' English Dept.

Have you ever noticed that when your friends unexpectedly pop by is also when your house is looking its worst? Or how about that last-minute call from your extended family telling you they are in the area and are going to be at your place shortly. I’m an expert in procrastination, and both of these situations have happened to me too many times. But I’ve learned how to quick-clean my home’s public spaces in 10 minutes or less. These tips are by no means ways to actually clean your home, but they will give the appearance of a respectable home when you’re short on time.

Hide the dirty dishes. Nothing makes a kitchen look worse than a sink full of dirty dishes. Put those used items in the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is full of clean dishes, put away just enough to make room for the dirty ones. It’s not a big deal to run the clean ones through another cycle after your guests leave. Don’t have a dishwasher? Fill a plastic tub with the dirty dishes and hide it in the cabinet under the sink. Just don’t forget that you put it there.

RELATED: Get a New Dish Rack to Hold and Hide Dirty Dishes

Wipe, wipe, wipe. Use a clean, damp microfiber cloth and wipe over everything in your kitchen. Microfiber is a great tool, and all it takes is a little water and elbow grease. You don’t have to spray your counters or wipe them dry. Start at one end of your kitchen and wipe down all your appliances, countertops and the sink. The microfiber will remove food, fingerprints and dust all in one motion.

Bedrooms to the rescue. After you’ve got the kitchen looking presentable, move on to the entryway. This will be the first area your guests will see. Pick up shoes, coats and backpacks and put them in a closet or bedroom. Your bedrooms are your secret weapon for hiding clutter.

By a nose. A quick way to make a great first impression is to place a fragrance over the doorway where your guests will enter. Just a light spritz of your favorite room spray on the door will give guests a lovely scent as they enter your home.

Don’t forget about the bathroom. It should be clean and ready for your guests. Undoubtedly, someone will need to use it. Start by closing the shower curtain and hide any clutter behind it. Give the toilet bowl a quick swish with a toilet brush. Then use a damp, fine woven microfiber cloth and start wiping the mirror, the top of the vanity, the sink and finally the outside of the toilet. If your family uses a bar soap, hide it inside the shower and get out a pump soap for your guests. And make sure to put out a clean hand towel.

Last-minute vacuum. Now that you have the kitchen and baths ready for your guests, take a few minutes to run the vacuum quickly over all the floors in your public rooms. You don’t have to be meticulous, just pick up the obvious dirt and pet hair. Remember, you are just cleaning for appearances. Your guests aren’t going to be looking that closely at your cleaning skills.

Flower power. If you don’t have time to go through your home and clean, create ways to distract your guests with pretty diversions. Simple cut flowers popped into a Mason jar make your kitchen look bright and clean. Also, a classic white plate filled with colorful fruit will attract attention to what you want and away from what you don’t.

In fact, they may not even have windows and instead seal military personnel inside a closed cockpit to better protect them against threats.

But how could they see the battlefield around them without windows? To see outside, Soldiers could use a new technology made by Honeywell that lets them “see” with virtual reality and augmented reality.

Using a headset and a wraparound display, drivers are given the effect of “seeing” beyond the armor to the war zone around them. The augmented reality even enhances their “sight” by overlaying crucial information like enemy movements and safe routes ahead.

This remarkable advance is part of the DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) initiative that could lead to an entirely new era of tanks and armored combat vehicles. GXV-T would offer tank-like protection on a vehicle that resembles a futuristic All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) but is smaller than a traditional tank.

SLIME OF 300-MILLION-YEAR-OLD CREATURE MAY BE USED FOR BODY ARMOR

DARPA awarded eight contracts to work on the exciting, groundbreaking GXV-T. Honeywell is one of these companies.

Recently, Honeywell successfully tested this window-free tech on a tough, off-road desert course at speeds of more than 35mph. The drivers successfully maneuvered the course from inside the closed cockpit relying on the “sight” provided by the virtual reality system.

Unsurprisingly, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps are already interested in DARPA’s vision for this radical new vehicle. The GXV-T would provide the U.S. military with enormous advantages over adversaries.

Far Better Armor

The big advantage to no windows? Keep US military personnel inside a whole lot safer.

Another research thrust for DARPA on the GXV-T project is radically overhauling the approach to armor. For more than a century, the approach has been more armor equals more protection.

WILL COMBAT VEHICLES USE URINE FOR FUEL?

There are, however, tradeoffs to more armor, such as adding more weight, which means less speed and agility. These capabilities can be essential in some scenarios so finding the right balance between the armor trade-offs is never easy.

But with GXV-T, the goal is a closed cockpit that allows reactive armor to enhance safety on the outside. Reactive armor detects threats and reacts. So, for example, when it anticipates the impact of a threat like an RPG, this armor would be able to shift and concentrate in the area it will impact.

Without the windows, it may be possible to do far more with less armor and still offer far better protection.

PODCAST: VAMPIRE BATS V. NAVY SEALS. INSIDE JUNGLE WARFARE WITH SEAL TEAM 6

How does it work?

Honeywell harnessed its experience with aircraft cockpits and applied it to creating a GXV-T “cockpit.”

Cameras and sensors fixed on the vehicle feed data to onboard computers. These stitch together the data into one cohesive image and the wraparound internal screens display this imagery.

WILL A SINGLE BOMB STOP NORTH KOREA?

The operator dons the special virtual and augmented reality headset and when that is combined with the panoramic screen it creates the effect of “seeing” outside the vehicle – whilst safely inside a closed cockpit.

Already, Honeywell’s virtual landscape allows an operator to off-road at realistic speeds. This set of initial tests were conducted with 160-degree views. DARPA’s aim is for a 360-degree view and although it may seem impossible, it may be possible to achieve that.

Motion sickness and eye strain are two common complaints and tough challenges for companies working to advance virtual reality. Honeywell seems to have cracked these pesky problems because the feedback thus far has been very positive with drivers not suffering from either complaint.

Augmented Reality View

Safety and protection is paramount, but another key advantage to this revolutionary approach is providing operators with enhanced “sight.” With augmented reality, operators can have crucial data overlaid as well.

Already, Honeywell has been able to build in speed, heading, and position data augmentation. But lots of further symbols could be added to further assist driver’s during their missions.

AUSA 2017: 4 AMAZING LAND VEHICLES AT THIS YEAR’S SHOW

Enemy movements, the best routes to avoid detection, upcoming difficult terrain, threat detection – these are just a few examples of useful data that could augment what a driver “sees.” Enhanced situational awareness will also improve safety for personnel.

In many ways, this is very similar to the data displayed in U.S. fighter pilots’ cockpits, but would now be available to ground forces in closed cockpits.

PODCAST: LEARN HOW TO FLY A FIGHTER JET WITH A FASCINATING FIGHTER PILOT

What is GXV-T?

DARPA’s Ground X-Vehicle Technology program (GXV-T) is advancing tech for combat in many ways. Overall, the goal is to produce smarter, faster and more agile vehicles for the future force.

Another area that will increase protection, for example, is the progress being made to develop the GXV-T as ultra-stealthy.

ATHENA LASER WEAPON 'KILLS' 5 'OUTLAWS'

Tanks are not exactly known for being stealthy. But imagine if the military could have a vehicle with tank protection, but fighter jet stealth? Advances are being made in tech for the GXV-T to evade detection by the enemy from acoustic and electromagnetic methods through to infrared.

A new kind of driving

For the military, these kinds of big breakthroughs could pave the way to the future force taking tanks into battle that have remarkable advantages like this virtual and augmented reality and futuristic reactive armor. This would turn them into much lighter and far more agile vehicles, while providing even more protection for U.S. troops.

But there is also potential for significant impact in the civilian world. Honeywell’s achievement could help pave the way to a future where civilians take advantage of the enhanced safety closed cockpits could offer and drive windowless as well. Or windshields could become transformed into displays that offer augmented reality, suggesting optimal routes to avoid traffic so drivers will never have to look down at their phones for Waze again.",Powerful tiny tanks with VR and futuristic cockpits could revolutionize the battlefield,http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/26/powerful-tiny-tanks-with-vr-and-futuristic-cockpits-could-revolutionize-battlefield.html

October is an exciting month for the family. Even if you or your kids aren’t into the haunted part of Halloween, you can still embrace the festivities of fall, warmth and togetherness. Encourage your kids to exercise their imagination and creativity with these Halloween-themed crafts that everyone can participate in.

1. Family Portrait Pumpkins

Skip the mess of carving pumpkins this year by investing in some good old fashioned chalk. Simply paint a circle on each pumpkin with chalkboard paint. You’ll probably have to apply at least three coats of paint. Then, draw a self-portrait using a piece of chalk. Voila!

2. Colorful Garland

Before kids jump in the pile of leaves this weekend, encourage them to collect a few especially vibrant ones. Press the leaves in a book for a couple of hours while the kids continue to play outside. Once they’ve been flattened, show your children how to clip the leaves to a string with miniature clothespins and find spots to hang them throughout the house together.

3. Harvest Vignettes

Look to nature’s bounty for easy decor ideas. Arrange apples, pears, pumpkins, squash and gourds in baskets throughout your kitchen and dining areas. Having easy access to fruits will also promote healthy eating for your family this season.

4. Candy Laboratory

First, gather vases, jars and dishes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Then fill each container with colorful treats, like candy corn, marshmallows and of course candy eyeballs. Challenge your family members to come up with a creative new name for each candy. Crows bones, zombie zingers and pumpkin teeth are excellent examples. Arrange the jars neatly on a tray or turn a bar cart into a wonderful candy buffet.

5. Candy Corn Checkerboards

A checkerboard made from a placemat can be quickly rolled up and easily tucked away. Cut a 1½-inch square from cardstock paper to make a stencil. Start at one edge of the square and paint every other square. Precise placement and straight lines aren’t necessary in this project, which makes it great for kids. Small imperfections can even give the game a rustic or quirky look. You can use candy corn or small plastic spiders as game pieces.

6. Gothic Deskscape

Fall break is the perfect time to take a break from work and transform your home office into a spooky showcase. Open a dictionary and lay a magnifying glass on the definition of “Halloween”. Stack a pile of literature to display your favorite fall titles, like The Tell-Tale Heart or Harry Potter. Swap out a desk lamp’s lightbulb for one with an orange glow or purple hue, and don’t forget an inkwell and quill pen!

7. Mantel Accessories

Fireplace mantels are the go-to spot for any holiday decor. Find wooden display letters at your local craft store to spell out “boo” or another ghastly term above the hearth. Place a mini pumpkin or two and add some candles. A stack of books and a vase of bare branches are also great ideas.

8. Stylish Spider Webs

Tulle is great for wrapping accessories, draping over doorways and even dressing up the bushes. Don’t overlook the nooks and crannies though. This fabric is even more effective in small corners of a room since that’s where spiders hang out most anyway. You might even have to dust off a few real webs before making your own.

9. Window Decals

Shadows and silhouettes can be extra spooky this time of year. Use your interior lighting and the long dark nights to your advantage by decorating windows with DIY decals. Sketch large outlines of your favorite Halloween characters on fade-resistant paper. Then cut out your witches, skeletons, bats, cats or ghosts and tape them to the inside of your home’s windows.

10. Dip-Dyed Baskets

Prepare for trick-or-treaters this year by sprucing up a traditional candy basket. Fill a plastic container (larger than your basket) with semigloss paint. Place the basket in the paint and push down until all sides are covered to your desired height. Let the basket sit overnight on an elevated rack you don’t mind getting dirty, like an old cookie sheet. Reuse this basket all year long as stylish storage!",10 DIY Halloween decorations for all ages,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/13/10-diy-halloween-decorations-for-all-ages.html

The number-crunching which followed was automatic. The results were unusual.

This object is in an odd position. It’s moving very fast. And it’s in what appears to be a somewhat extreme orbit. Extreme enough not to actually be an orbit, in fact.

Observations published by the by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center (MPC) suggest it could have come from deep space.

Specifically, it could be a comet that has escaped another star.

“If further observations confirm the unusual nature of this orbit, this object may be the first clear case of an interstellar comet,” the MPC declares.

WHAT IS C/2017 U1?

The PanSTARRS telescope spotted the object only after it was flung back out towards the stars by our Sun.

It’s not likely to ever return. It flashed past Earth at 24 million kilometres on October 14.

Many eyes watched it closely, keen to determine exactly what it was. Their curiosity was piqued by where it had come from.

Most objects orbiting our Sun do so along a common plane: the planets, dwarf planets and asteroids mostly swing around in roughly the same way.

This one appears to have come down on the plane from 122 degrees, from the direction of the star Vega, in the constellation Lyra. And its path did not indicate the curved ellipse typical of clockwork-like returning comets.

Best guesstimates make it a comet of about 160m diameter, with a surface reflectivity (albedo) of about 10 per cent.

A WANDERER

The object has just been through a close call (in Solar System terms): it came within 38 million km of our star before its momentum and the Sun’s gravity hurled it back outward.

Normally such a close pass would be fatal. But C/2017U1 was travelling too fast for the Sun’s heat to consume it.

It was moving at 26km per second when first observed.

Astronomers are now attempting to refine their observations and data to pinpoint exactly where it came from. If it truly is of interstellar origin, the next task is to find which star it is likely to have come from.

At the moment, it appears to have been somewhere in the direction of the star Vega.

It’s also likely to have been wandering, alone, in deep space for a very, very long time.

Vega is a relatively close neighbour of our Sun at 25 light years distance. At the speed it’s travelling, it would take about 1.7 million years to cross the interstellar divide.

The mariners had originally set sail with their two dogs from Hawaii to Tahiti this spring. After having engine problems on May 30 during bad weather, the two thought they could make it to land by using only their sail, according to the Navy.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.","When country singer Katie Armiger embarked on her first radio tour, the green-eyed 15-year-old from Sugarland, Texas, was brimming with excitement at the prospect of a music career.

The teenager, who loved nothing more than writing and performing her own songs, believed that a radio tour would allow her to follow in the footsteps of her heroes like Patsy Cline, Linda Ronstadt, Martina McBride and all of the other female artists who came before her.

But Armiger told Fox News she would soon learn that the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry came with a hefty price.

Years before pop superstar Taylor Swift was groped by a radio DJ from Denver, Colo., Armiger says she was fending off a different handsy DJ while she was underage.

""I was at a radio station in Texas and was taking a promo photo with one of the on-air DJs after doing my performances and he grabbed my butt during the photo,"" Armiger told us. ""And at the same time he was whispering in my ear, 'When are you going to be legal?'""

Armiger told us she ""was shocked"" and ""terrified"" but had no one to lean on for support.

""I brought up my fears and I was told that's how it was and if I wanted to be in music, I'd have to get over it,"" she said.

Armiger decided to keep her mouth shut after that, but things came to a head in June 2016 when the singer was sued by her record label, Cold River, and filed a counterclaim alleging the label told her to ""sex it up"" in order to become successful.

According to the lawsuit, Armiger said she was asked to ""purchase 'hot, game-changing' clothes,"" ""hug, kiss and flirt"" with radio programmers. Armiger said she was told she needed to make the programmers ""wish you would take them home with you.""

Cold River Record head Pete O'Heeron told Fox News at the time the suit was ""baseless"" and ""an attempt to try and smear good people.""

Armiger said she can't comment on her battle with Cold River after a settlement was made, but said she now wants to share her stories of sexual harassment after hearing the bombshell sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein that have rocked Hollywood.

""There's something really horrible going on behind the scenes,"" she told us, saying the country music community has its fair share of Weinstein-like behavior.

The now-26-year-old detailed several other stories of sexual harassment that she's encountered. Armiger recalled taking a radio programmer and his team to lunch when the program director asked everyone to share their ""top five list of women they would want to sleep with.""

After sharing his first choice, Armiger said a radio programmer turned to her, ""looking me in the eyes, he said, 'But you would absolutely be my No. 2.'""

Armiger said he then turned to her guitar player and said, ""Surely you've been f--king her. Where is she on your list?""

The guitar player suggested the group change the subject to something more appropriate, but Armiger said she still ""got flack"" for the exchange.

""The programmer called and said if I ever brought that guitar player back again he'd never play my music again,"" she recalled.

The singer said she was similarly rebuked after a radio DJ was interviewing her about her album ""Confessions of a Nice Girl"" at the 2010 ACM Awards.

""As we were doing the interview, he is trying to feel me up under the table -- this is on air -- trying to ask me whether or not my album title was true because surely I couldn't be a nice girl. I had to be a naughty girl,"" Armiger said.

When the DJ later asked her what her least favorite interview question was, Armiger was ""pissed"" and curtly said, ""The worst question is that you're asking me if I'm a nice girl or a naughty girl because what kind of person asks that?""

She said ""that didn't go over well"" and she learned ""not to talk back"" after that.

When Armiger filed her lawsuit against Cold River, she said many people in the country music world would not work with her anymore.

""When my story first became public and in the aftermath when I was finally to start looking for other opportunities in the industry, we went to [publishing houses] but we would be met with, 'We're not going to sign you, but we're really a big fan and we just want to know your story and how are you?'""

She continued, ""That was the consensus; that was everywhere I went. I would talk to booking agents and they were scared to work with me because they either thought somehow the tour would be canceled or I was a liability to work with.""

Armiger said she does not want to name her harassers out of fear of retribution, but she hopes coming forward with her story of harassment in the country music world will make a difference because ""it has to change.""

""I don't think it will change until people start speaking out, and for the most part they're too scared,"" she told us. ""Look at my story -- they'll see that I spoke out and spoke my truth and thought for the most part people would believe my story. I didn't ever think that it would be met with doubt or disdain.""",Katie Armiger says she was blacklisted from country music after sexual harassment allegations,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/23/katie-armiger-says-was-blacklisted-from-country-music-after-sexual-harassment-allegations.html

Jobe, a Christian worship leader, was on tour with other worship artists last year when she had a dream about healing the nation.

“Jesus really is the answer,” she said. “I know people say that a lot, but it really is the truth. And the simplicity of the cross. Sometimes people try to make it so complex or that it’s about these rules and regulations, but it’s not. It’s about a relationship with Jesus.”

The singer-songwriter known for “Forever” and “I Am Not Alone” has been singing on a yearlong tour, leading worship in cities across the United States.

Jobe talked with Fox News about her song “Heal Our Land” before stepping onstage at the Playstation Theater in the heart of Times Square.

“I had this dream on the tour that it was raining inside this church,” she said.

“It was just like a pure water all over the floor of this church that was just like washing the floor, but it was like pure and clean. It wasn’t murky and dirty like you would imagine,” she said.

“When I woke up, it just felt prophetic,” Jobe said, adding the dream felt very intentional from the Lord and it was only confirmed after she discussed it with other worship leaders at the time.

“It just felt like God was trying to say, as a reminder, that he wants to come back for a pure and spotless bride,” she said referring to Jesus’ relationship with the church in the New Testament. “It’s his heart to come back for us, but we’re not there yet.”

Jobe wrote the worship song with her friend, singer-songwriter Brooke Ligertwood.

“I told her I wanted to write something that has to do with the church, the bride of Christ getting back to where we need to be. You know, like, what’s going on in the world around us – what could we be praying, what could the church be singing that would really help.”

The song’s bridge is based on the scripture from 2 Chronicles 7:14, a verse that has been invoked by many Christian leaders for national prayer gatherings and other revival events.

The verse reads, “If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”

Jobe said, ""The rest of the song is really just a prayer for the church to be singing, to have a pure heart, to be unified, not to be divided, not be against anything but only for what God wants us to be doing,” she said.

She said the response has been really powerful.

“I feel like when we go into it every night, people just sing it at the top of their lungs,” the worship leader said. “I think it’s just one of those songs that people just connect to because there are so many unknowns right now, and so much fear people are dealing with, and with what’s going on in our nation.”

Ultimately, Jobe believes our land can only be healed by God and she hopes to continue to bring more people into a deeper relationship with Christ through her music and through the rest of The Garden Tour, which ends in December.

“What’s really special is this tour has been almost like we’re bringing buckets of water to people, and just helping them feel refreshed, and feel like, ‘Oh, yeah, I don’t have to do this by myself, but God is for me,’ and that they’re being reminded of the power of faith and the power of prayer,” she said.

“That God is moved by faith. So a song like ‘Heal Our Land,’ and declaring these things of God we pray, we humble ourselves, we seek your face. God said that if we would do that, He would heal our land, and I think they’re experiencing that on these nights of worship.”",Kari Jobe: Jesus is 'the answer' to healing the nation,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/27/kari-jobe-jesus-is-answer-to-healing-nation.html

Alexandra Leigh Carter, of Toowoomba, Queensland, says she purchased the makeup kit at the Australian supermarket chain Woolworths — and even tested it out on her son’s wrist for 20 minutes — before applying the product to his face during a “trial run” ahead of Halloween.

“This was only on him for 3 minutes and then had to immediately take him for a shower,” she wrote alongside photos of her little boy with redness and irritation on his face. “It has severely burnt his skin.”

Carter says she shared the post to warn other parents to thoroughly test the makeup products their kids plan to use on Halloween. But she also called for the product to be discontinued, and called it “rubbish.”

“I've had his face painted countless time [sic], though whatever is in your product is horrific,” she wrote.

In the comments, Carter further explained that the ordeal “absolutely scared the hell out of both of us,” leading her son to ask if his would be scarred forever. Thankfully, she confirmed the redness died down, and that there doesn't appear to be any lasting marks on his face.

“Not even the most conscious of mums can avoid something like this from happening when you purchase products intended for children,” she said, adding that she didn’t make an “informed choice” when purchasing the cheap product. “I made a mistake unfortunately and THANKFULLY never put it on my youngest son as he does have adverse reactions.”

Carter claims she was offered a $25 gift card as compensation for the incident. She also wrote that Woolworths has been “nothing but helpful and apologetic,” though she is still waiting to hear the results of their investigation into the makeup product.

In the meantime, she says, she’ll be comparing the product’s ingredients to others on the market.

Like too many others, Ken Burns portrays the young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of the Vietnam War as pot-smoking, drug-addicted, hippie marauders.
Because of endless fairy tales told by Ken Burns and others, many Americans associate Richard Nixon with the totality and the worst events of Vietnam.
This intricate and sophisticated approach took shape over four wartime years but receives only superficial mention in Mr. Burns’ production.
Mr. Burns, like John Kerry, has committed a grave injustice to those of us who fought there.","Washington, D.C. – When Richard Nixon was in the White House, I was in Vietnam and he was my commander-in-chief. When I was on Ronald Reagan’s National Security Council staff, I had the opportunity to brief former President Nixon on numerous occasions and came to admire his analysis of current events, insights on world affairs and compassion for our troops. His preparation for any meeting or discussion was exhaustive. His thirst for information was unquenchable and his tolerance for fools was non-existent.

Mr. Nixon’s prosecution of the war in Southeast Asia is poorly told by Ken Burns in his PBS documentary ""The Vietnam War.” That is but one of many reasons Mr. Burns’ latest work is such a disappointment and a tragic lost opportunity.

It’s sad, but I’ve come to accept that the real story of the heroic American GIs in Vietnam may never be told. Like too many others, Ken Burns portrays the young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of the Vietnam War as pot-smoking, drug-addicted, hippie marauders.

Those with whom I served were anything but. They did not commit the atrocities alleged in the unforgivable lies John Kerry described to a congressional committee so prominently featured by Mr. Burns. The troops my brother and I were blessed to lead were honorable, heroic and tenacious. They were patriotic, proud of their service, and true to their God and our country.

To depict them otherwise, as Ken Burns does, is an egregious disservice to them, the families of the fallen and to history. But his treatment of my fellow Vietnam War veterans is just the start. Some of the most blatant travesties in the film are reserved for President Nixon.

Ken Burns may not recall – but my family remembers do: It was Lyndon Johnson who sent my brother and me to war. It was Richard Nixon who brought us home.

Because of endless fairy tales told by Ken Burns and others, many Americans associate Richard Nixon with the totality and the worst events of Vietnam. It’s hardly evident in the Burns “documentary,” but important to note; when President Richard Nixon was elected in 1968, he inherited a nation – and a world – engulfed in discord and teetering on the brink of widespread chaos. His predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, was forced from office with a half million U.S. troops mired in combat and fierce anti-American government demonstrations across the country and in our nation’s capital.

Ken Burns may not recall – but my family remembers do: It was Lyndon Johnson who sent my brother and me to war. It was Richard Nixon who brought us home. It is very likely we are alive today because Richard Nixon kept his word.

That’s not the only opportunity for accuracy Mr. Burns ignored. He could have credited President Nixon with granting 18-year olds the right to vote in July 1971 with the 26th Amendment to our Constitution [does “Ken” even recall the slogan, “Old Enough to Fight – Old Enough to Vote!” He should. Burns turned 18 that same month.].

President Nixon pressed on to all but finish the war. As promised, he brought our combat units home, returned 591 Prisoners of War to their wives and families, ended the draft, leveraged the conflict to open ties with China and improved relations with the Soviet Union. He pushed both Communist giants in Beijing and Moscow to force their North Vietnamese puppet into a negotiated settlement. Yet, he is portrayed in the Burns documentary as a cold-blooded, calculating politician more interested in re-election than the lives of U.S. troops in combat.

Contrary to the film’s portrayal, Nixon had a complicated strategy to achieve “Peace with Honor.” His goal was to train and equip the South Vietnamese military to defend their own country in a process he called “Vietnamization” and thereby – withdraw American troops.

President Nixon succeeded in isolating the North Vietnamese diplomatically and negotiated a peace agreement that preserved the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own political future. Imperfect as the Saigon government was, by 1973 the South Vietnamese had many well-trained troops and units that fought well and were proud to be our allies. This intricate and sophisticated approach took shape over four wartime years but receives only superficial mention in Mr. Burns’ production.

Despite Democrat majorities in both houses of Congress, Nixon – a deft political powerhouse – attained consistent support from America’s “Silent Majority.”

If Mr. Burns read President Nixon’s memoir or his two successive books in which the former president recounts his emotional anguish at the war’s toll – ""No More Vietnams"" and ""In the Arena"" – there is little evidence in the PBS production. Instead, Burns cherry-picks from the infamous “Nixon tapes” to brand the president as a devious manipulator, striving for mass deception – a patently false allegation.

By the time President Nixon resigned office on August 9, 1974, the Vietnam War was all but won and the South Vietnamese were confident of securing a permanent victory. But in December 1974 – three months after President Nixon departed the White House – a vengeful, Democrat-dominated Congress cut off all aid to South Vietnam.

It was a devastating blow for those to whom President Nixon had promised – not U.S. troops – but steadfast military, economic and diplomatic support. As chronicled in memoirs written afterwards in Hanoi, Moscow and Beijing, the communists celebrated. The ignominious end came with a full-scale North Vietnamese invasion five months later.

Despite the war’s tragic conclusion – and the trauma that continues to afflict our country – there is little in the Burns so-called documentary about the courage, patriotism and dedication of the U.S. troops who fought honorably, bravely, and the despicable way in which we were “welcomed” home.

The PBS “documentary” frequently reminds viewers of the “gallant nationalist fervor” among the North Vietnamese. But the South Vietnamese are portrayed as little more than conniving urchins and weak pawns of the imperialist Americans.

In a technique favored by the “Progressive-Left,” Mr. Burns uses a small cadre of anti-war U.S. and pro-Hanoi Vietnamese “eyewitnesses” to explain the complicated policies of the U.S. government. Mr. Burns apparently refused to interview Henry Kissinger, telling the Portland Press Herald he doubted “...Kissinger’s authority to adequately convey the perspectives of the U.S. government.” This alone disqualifies this “documentary” as definitive history on the Vietnam War.

Though Ken Burns and his collaborators claim otherwise, the real heroes of “The Vietnam War” were not U.S. protestors, but the troops my brother and I led. They fought valiantly for our country and the president who brought us home.

Since meeting President Nixon in the 1980s, I have always remembered how he understood the incredible sacrifice of American blood in the battlefields of Vietnam. He was dedicated to ending the war the right way and committed to sustaining American honor. He kept his promise to bring us home.

Ken Burns failed to keep his promise to tell all sides about the long and difficult war in Vietnam. Mr. Burns, like John Kerry, has committed a grave injustice to those of us who fought there.","Oliver North: PBS and Ken Burns get Vietnam – and Richard Nixon – wrong, again",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/27/oliver-north-pbs-and-ken-burns-get-vietnam-and-richard-nixon-wrong-again.html

If you have allergies or asthma, or are sensitive to pollution, you may have considered purchasing an air purifier to clean the air inside your home. Now, with smoke from destructive wildfires still burning in Northern California affecting people as far as 100 miles away, even those without specific health concerns are thinking about ways to improve indoor air quality. But with so many types of filtration systems on the market (and prices ranging from $100 to nearly $1,000), it can be hard to know where to begin. Check out this quick guide to home air purifiers to figure out which are worth the cost.

Why use an air purifier? Indoor air pollution comes from a combination of particulate matter (dust, mold, pet dander and particles from smoke and cooking stoves) and gaseous pollutants (vehicle exhaust, smoke and chemical fumes) and can be far worse than the pollution outside, simply because it has no way to dissipate.

Those who suffer from asthma or allergies can be especially sensitive to air quality, and using an air purifier could be helpful, together with other methods of keeping out pollution and allergens.

Purify your home, not just the air. Air purifiers can do wonders for removing particulate matter from the air; the problem is that dust, pet dander and the like don’t stay in the air for long. Allergens drift to the ground and become embedded in rugs and soft furnishings — places an air purifier cannot reach. A combination approach will reduce indoor air pollution and allergens more than any one method alone. Here are a few strategies to try:

○ Remove wall-to-wall carpeting; go for easy-to-clean hard flooring and washable area rugs.

○ Vacuum and dust with a microfiber cloth regularly.

○ Ban smoking in and around the house.

○ Do not use a fireplace.

○ Do use the exhaust fans over the stove and in the bathroom.

○ Establish a no-shoes policy.

What to do if you are affected by wildfire smoke. Depending on wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, smoke from wildfires can drift 100 miles or farther from the source of the flames. If you are affected by wildfire smoke (but not in an evacuation area), the Centers for Disease Control recommends staying indoors when possible, with windows, doors, and fireplace dampers closed. Here are a few more things you can do:

○ Use your central air-conditioning system if you have one, but keep the fresh air intake closed to prevent smoke from getting inside.

○ Clean or replace the HVAC filter more frequently as long as you are experiencing smoky conditions.

○ Cut down on activities that contribute to indoor air pollution, including burning candles and using a fireplace, wood stove or gas stove.

○ Avoid vacuuming, as this can stir up large particles that have settled.

○ If you do not have an in-duct air filtration system, it can be helpful to use a portable air purifier with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove some of the particulate matter from the air.

○ If you have a medical emergency from smoke, you should call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room immediately.

How air purifiers work. There are a few different types of air purifiers on the market, and not all of them are especially effective or safe. It is important to know what you are buying, so read the fine print on your air purifier before purchasing. The main thing to check is how the purifier cleans the air. It will likely use one or more of these methods:

○ High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: This is the most common and one of the most effective methods available.

○ Activated carbon: Usually used with a HEPA filter or another filter, activated carbon can help reduce pollution by attracting some chemicals, which bond to the surface of the carbon.

○ Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) cleaners: These use a UV light to kill viruses, bacteria, allergens and some molds. UVGI cleaners may not reduce allergy or asthma symptoms, because typical home cleaners have limited effectiveness.

○ Electrostatic precipitators: Particles entering the purifier are given a charge and then trapped on oppositely charged plates. These machines create a small amount of ozone, which is a lung irritant and pollutant itself, so this type of purifier is probably best avoided.

Not effective as an air purifier at all, ozone generators are being marketed as air cleaners, but they actually add lung-irritating ozone to your home, which can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend buying ozone generators.

When to choose a whole-house air cleaner: If you have a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in your home, you have the option of having a whole-house air cleaner installed right in the ductwork. The benefits of a whole-house system are that all of the air is cleaned and there are no bulky appliances to deal with. In-duct systems are expensive, and they must be professionally installed and maintained.

When to choose a portable room purifier: Room purifiers are a good choice for smaller spaces, and multiple units can be used to clean the air even in a larger home. They are portable, so they are a good solution for renters, and cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per unit.

Get to know the rating systems. For in-duct air filters, look for the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) to tell how efficiently they pull particles from the air. MERV values range from 1 to 20; a system rated 7 or higher is about as effective as a HEPA filter. True HEPA filters, which have MERV values of 17 to 20, are not typically installed in HVAC systems. However, some newer homes may be specially designed with in-duct HEPA filtration.

When shopping for a portable air purifier, look for a clean air delivery rate (CADR) of at least 250, but the higher the better. This is a voluntary system developed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), so not all appliances have a CADR.

An Energy Star label on any air purifier indicates better energy efficiency but does not necessarily mean it is more effective — so also be sure to check the MERV or CADR rating.

Want to be really sure your air purifier is doing its job? Look for the AHAM Verifide mark on your portable air cleaner, which indicates that the manufacturer’s claims have been independently tested and certified.",What to look for when buying air purifiers for your home,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/26/what-to-look-for-when-buying-air-purifiers-for-your-home.html

The first sight of a daffodil, whether in your garden or in a store, is proof that spring is here. Even better, they’re practically foolproof to grow. They’re perennial bulbs, coming back year after year. They’re cold hardy and don’t need summer water to thrive. They’re also not a target for deer or gophers. If you want to enjoy these bulbs come spring, though, fall is the time to plant.

Caution: Keep daffodil bulbs away from pets, as they are toxic.

Botanical name: Narcissus spp.

Common names: Daffodil, jonquil, narcissus

Origin: Native to Europe and North Africa

Bloom season: Late winter and spring; rebloom every year

Where they grow: Hardy to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 40 degrees Celsius (USDA zones 3 to 9)

Light requirements: Full sun

Water requirements: Regular water when growing and blooming

Benefits and tolerances: Easy to grow; tolerate most soils and prefer dry conditions in summer; deer, rabbits, gophers, squirrels and chipmunks all avoid them.

When to plant: Begin planting bulbs when the soil begins to cool, approximately two to four weeks before you expect the ground to freeze in colder climates. That might be as early as September in the coldest climates but is more likely October in most locations.

If you live in a warm-winter climate where freezes are late or unlikely, buy the bulbs early when you have the best selection; then store them in a cool, dry spot out of sunlight until your soil temperature has reached about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 15.6 degrees Celsius, usually around mid-November.

Daffodil basics. Daffodil lovers and experts categorize the Narcissus genus into 13 divisions. If that is overwhelming, take the easier approach and use familiar common names. Daffodil is used for those with larger blooms, while narcissus refers to those with smaller flowers, which usually bloom early. The paperwhite narcissus, a favorite for forcing, falls into this latter category. Jonquil denotes the N. jonquilla species and its hybrids.

Choosing bulbs. Look for bulbs that feel firm and heavy and don’t show any signs of injury. Store in a cool, dry, airy spot out of direct sunlight before planting.

You might also find other daffodil species and hybrids. ‘Tête-à-Tête’ and fragrant ‘Tiny Bubbles’ are only about 6 inches tall and work well in rock gardens.

If your local selection is limited or you want something unusual, order bulbs online. They will be shipped to you when it’s the right time to plant in your climate zone. Some good sources for bulbs include Brent and Becky’s Bulbs, John Scheepers and White Flower Farm.

Where to plant. Choose a spot in full sun, although in the hottest climates they will prefer partial shade once they finish blooming. Daffodils will tolerate most soils as long as they drain well, though they prefer acidic to neutral soil. Amend your soil before planting if it doesn’t drain well.

How to use it. Plant en masse or set them among other plants in a garden bed or border. Daffodils also are good choices for containers.

Daffodils can be used to create a woodland or meadow effect. Simply toss a handful of bulbs into a prepared planting area in order to create a more naturalistic design. Adjust the bulbs as needed so the center and one end of the bed are more densely planted, giving the effect that the bulbs have gradually spread from a single spot.

Daffodils are popular cut flowers as well. They’re fine when used alone in an arrangement, but they emit a fluid that will cause other flowers to wilt. If you’re using them in a mixed arrangement, soak them overnight in a separate vase or container before adding them in with the other flowers.

How to plant. Set bulbs, pointed ends up, into the soil two to three times as deep as they are tall, between 3 and 5 inches deep for smaller bulbs and up to 6 inches deep for larger ones. Be sure there will be at least 3 inches of soil over the bulbs in colder climates. Space smaller bulbs about three times their width when planting and larger ones at least 6 to 8 inches apart. If you want, you can add a small amount of bulb fertilizer around the bulbs at this time. Cover with soil, and water thoroughly.

Growing notes. Daffodils are easy to care for once they’re in the ground. Provide additional water in fall if it is dry and through the winter in drought-prone areas. Provide regular water if Mother Nature doesn’t while they are growing and when they’re in bloom. Keep watering until the leaves start to turn yellow; then stop.

Daffodils don’t need summer water. If they get much rain, be sure the soil drains well to prevent bulb rot and other problems.

You don’t need to fertilize bulbs. If you do want to give the blooms some extra help, top-dress the area around the bulbs with a 5-10-10 granular fertilizer when the leaves begin to emerge.

Deadhead the blooms once they’ve faded if you want, but keep the leaves in place. Remove the leaves once they’re completely yellow, lightly work the soil around the plants and then add mulch. You can also add a small amount of 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs at this time if flower production is fading.

Divide only when flower production begins to falter. The best time to do this is right before the foliage completely yellows. Simply dig up the clumps and divide into smaller sections. Replant immediately, or store them in paper bags or ventilated sacks (nylons work well) in a cool, dry, airy spot out of the sun.

Pests are rare, but the narcissus bulb fly can be a problem. Don’t plant any bulbs that are soft or damaged, and cultivate and mulch after foliage dies down to prevent them from finding their way to the bulbs.

Container culture. Daffodils are standouts in containers. You can plant a single daffodil in a 1-gallon container, three to four in a 2-gallon container or masses of them in larger containers. Add potting soil to your container so the bulbs will sit at the same depth as they would in the garden. Rather than spacing them out, crowd the bulbs together to get a massed effect when they’re in bloom. Water thoroughly, and provide water throughout the fall and winter and into the growing season if you don’t get regular rain or snow cover.

In warmer-winter climates, keep the container outdoors and provide additional water if you don’t have enough rainfall. In cold-winter climates where containers are vulnerable, bring into a greenhouse or unheated garage or shed. Water regularly if they won’t receive regular moisture. Bring the containers to the foreground of your garden when they’re in bloom. (You can even sink them into the ground.)

For larger bulbs, one season in a container is all you can expect. Smaller ones, however, can last several years. If you want to keep them going, move containers to an out-of-the-way, sunny spot after the blooms fade. Once the leaves are yellowed, cut them off and add a 5-10-10 fertilizer around the bulbs. Cover with mulch. Begin watering again in fall as needed.",Your planting guide for beautiful yellow daffodils,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/your-planting-guide-for-beautiful-yellow-daffodils.html

Not only is it uncomfortable, the condition can also cause irritability, fatigue and bloating. If you suffer from constipation more than occasionally, or the problem includes severe pain or bleeding, check with your doctor to see if something more serious is going on. While there are several causes for constipation, what you eat (lots of fiber!) and drink (lots of water!) can help get things moving. In addition to drinking plenty of water, which will help make your bowel movements softer and easier to pass, here are five foods to add to your grocery list for a happier pit stop.

Mangos

The most popular fruit in the world, mangos are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, as well as fiber to aid digestion. But it might be more than the fiber in mangos that helps get things moving. A recent study conducted at Texas A&M University found that people with chronic constipation supplemented with a mango supplement (the equivalent of one medium-sized mango a day) showed a more significant reduction in constipation in a four-week period compared to people receiving a non-mango fiber supplement. The researchers believe the phytochemicals in mango pulp were responsible for the better response on constipation, as well as inflammatory markers.

Flaxseeds

Known as one of the best ways to improve digestive health or relieve constipation, flaxseeds are a good source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. In one small study, 55 people with constipation caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) found that those who took flaxseeds not only reduced constipation but also showed a reduction in abdominal pain and bloating as compared to those who used psyllium (a fiber supplement). Like all sources of fiber, drink lots of water when consuming flaxseed and if you choose to include them in your diet, gradually work your way up to 2 tablespoons per day. Since our bodies can’t break down the whole seed, grind them (you can use a coffee grinder) directly before adding them to your food to get the most nutrients.

Broccoli

A powerhouse of nutrients, broccoli also contains fiber for digestive health. In addition, broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables contain an antioxidant called sulforaphane, which has been shown to lower the risk of chronic inflammation and help protect the lining of the stomach from bacterial overgrowth. Decreased inflammation in the digestive tract means less stress on the bowel, which can help decrease constipation.

Yogurt

Yogurt contains tens of millions of live beneficial bacteria called probiotics. Probiotics promote a healthy gut while decreasing inflammation. A research review of 14 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that on average, probiotics slowed “gut transit time” by 12.4 hours, increased the number of weekly bowel movements by 1.3, and helped soften stools, making them easier to pass. You can also get probiotics in fermented foods like Kefir, sauerkraut and kimchi.

Pears

If you’re feeling constipated and bloated, you’re going to want to keep the skin on these sweet treats. The skin of the pear has been shown to have about half of the pear’s total fiber. The skin of the pear also contains three to four times as many antioxidants and anti-inflammatory flavonoids as the flesh of the pear alone. Plus, pears are high in pectin, a form of fiber that is particularly helpful for constipation.",5 foods that help relieve constipation,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/10/27/5-foods-that-help-relieve-constipation.html

Actress Valerie Bertinelli, who America watched grow up on the hit show One Day at a Time, is now a fixture in the food world. The Golden Globe award-winning actress with her own Food Network show, sits down with Fox News's Lilian Huang Woo to talk about recipes from her new book Valerie's Home Cooking.

Take a LISTEN:

Back when we had a house in Park City, Utah, we frequented an Italian restaurant so often they put a sign above our regular table that said, ""Wolfie's Booth."" The reason we were at the restaurant so often? Their bacon-wrapped jalapeño shrimp. (Hold on a moment while I savor the memory of them. Seriously, my mouth is watering.) Sadly, the restaurant closed before I was able to get their recipe, so I developed this particular one on my own and have tinkered with it over the years to the point where I look for excuses to make it. A party, Sunday night football, a birthday, Tuesday night . . . I'm in, and so is my entire family, along with a few of my neighbors. The sauce is sweet with a hint of Cherry Coke, and once it connects with the jalapeño, it sits on the tongue with an exciting contrast of hot and sweet and savory. It goes well with a cold cocktail or even a light beer. These will disappear quickly.

Bacon-Wrapped Jalapeño Shrimp with Cherry Cola BBQ Sauce

Serves 16 Hands-on 35 minutes Total 45 minutes

CHERRY COLA BBQ SAUCE

1½ tablespoons bacon drippings

1/2 large red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)

2 garlic cloves, chopped

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon dry mustard

2 cups cherry cola soft drink

½ cup red wine vinegar

1 cup ketchup

SHRIMP

16 extra-large shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed (about 12 ounces)

1 jalapeño chile, stem removed, seeded, and cut lengthwise into 16 thin strips

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1 teaspoon black pepper

8 bacon slices, halved crosswise

Make the BBQ Sauce: Heat the bacon drippings in a small saucepan over medium-high. Add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute. Stir in the salt, garlic powder, and dry mustard, and cook, stirring often, until the spices are toasted and fragrant and the onions are a deep maroon color, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the cherry cola and vinegar, and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Stir in the ketchup. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 2 cups and the mixture coats the back of a spoon, 12 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the Shrimp: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium. Cut a long 1/4-inch-deep slit in the inner curve of each shrimp; insert 1 jalapeño strip. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Wrap each shrimp tightly with 1 bacon piece. Set on a plate, seam sides down.

Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp, seam sides down, in the hot skillet, and cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and the shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Serve the shrimp with the BBQ sauce.

Make Ahead: The BBQ sauce will hold up to 2 weeks in the fridge. If you're prepping for a party, the shrimp can be wrapped ahead of time and cooked later.

Trick Technique: If you're someone who loves their bacon in the morning, start saving the drippings in a jar for uses like this one!

Hamburger Helpa

Don't laugh. This dish might give you more insight into my culinary history than almost anything else. It's a throwback to my childhood and it speaks directly to my more-than-occasional desire for quickness and efficiency, in that I love a good casserole or one-skillet dish. No fuss, no muss, easy cleanup, and get-right-to-it dinner. I made this for Wolfie and his friends when they came home after soccer or Little League practice. I can still picture everyone at the kitchen table, doing homework, while I simmered the beef in the mélange of spices and added macaroni, cheese, and breadcrumbs, and then announced to a sea of smiling faces, ""Dinner's ready."" Years later, I whipped out this dish when Tom's kids entered the picture and everyone came home from college during breaks. We all know the store-bought mix; this homemade version is even better than the classic, I promise.

Serves 4 Hands-on 10 minutes Total 35 minutes

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 pound ground 90% lean beef

¼ teaspoon black pepper

1 teaspoon kosher salt

8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

2 cups whole milk

1¼ cups warm water

1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

11/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

½ cup chopped American cheese

2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives

1/4 cup panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

1 scallion, green part sliced

Melt the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the beef, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring to crumble, until browned, about 5 minutes. Preheat the broiler with the oven rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat. Reduce the stovetop heat to medium, and stir in the macaroni. Add the milk, warm water, mustard, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. 3. Bring to a low simmer; cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the macaroni is tender, about 12 minutes. Add the cheeses, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chives. Sprinkle the panko over the macaroni mixture. Broil until the panko is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with the scallion, and serve immediately.

Variation: Add some slices of jalapeño for extra kick.

The magazine is under fire after publishing an opinion piece this week titled ""Why are all the conservative loudmouths Irish-American?""

The article, written by Van Gosse, a history professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Penn., was published Monday and seeks to explain how “putative Irishmen” such as former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and ex-White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon “are now the face of the hard Right.”

“Why has the ascent of a bunch of people who in an earlier period might have been called Micks drawn no notice at all?” wrote Gosse, who said he is a quarter Irish-American on his father’s side.

He said the rise of the likes of Buchanan and Bannon, as well as Fox News’ Sean Hannity, are not accidental. Gosse links it to former U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who in the 1950s fueled fears of widespread Communism.

Gosse wrote, that by the 1960s, Irish Catholics, once in the periphery of American society, had “finally made it and become fully ‘white.’”

“Having fought their way to full inclusion, many were intent on pulling up the drawbridge,” he wrote.

“Jump forward to the present…Irish America has lost virtually all its distinctive qualities, becoming just one more version of whiteness colored by ethnicity,” Gosse wrote, adding someone saying they are “Irish Catholic” is like saying they are “Midwestern.”

“The only thing “Irish” about them is a talent for invective, which makes for a compelling style, a mix of pugnacity and certainty,” Gosse continued. “They are smart, articulate, and not at all embarrassed, especially when their opinions are vicious.”

Readers were quick to point out the bias in Gosse’s words, some calling the piece “racist” and demanding Newsweek apologize to Irish-Americans.

“Some major bigotry going on here. What was newsweek thinking publishing racist diatribe?!?” one reader commented.

Another wrote: “This reads like an old fashioned Wasp wishing the Irish knew their place.”

“I'm second generation Irish American on my father's side,"" another critic commented. ""I'm not usually bothered by Irish stereotypes. But this article is so dripping with ignorance it's jaw dropping and utterly offensive. Replace the word 'Irish' with any other ethnicity and it would never have gone to print and/or the author would've been fired. I'm stunned that a person of such ignorance is allowed to teach.”

Gosse and Newsweek did not immediately respond to Fox News’ requests for comment.

The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the largest anti-sexual assault organization in the U.S. has said that in the last two weeks, calls to their hotline has gone up by nearly a quarter over the same period last year. The spike occurred after the allegations against the Hollywood mogul first went public two weeks ago.

“We’ve been helping over 800 people a day,” RAINN president Scott Berkowitz said to Fox News. “Overall, over the last couple of weeks, it’s up 21 percent over prior [time periods].”

The increase comes as a larger national discussion about sexual assault and abuse of power has come to the forefront.

“Some nights, even though we’ve brought on dozens of additional staff to answer the hotline we’ve seen queues as high as 60 people waiting for help,” Berkowitz said.

A Rainn spokesperson says that there is usually a spike in calls after every high-profile accusation of sexual assault, according to a recent report in The Guardian. They say it’s due to everyday people motivated to share their own stories or are prompted to relieve their past attacks. The result is a surge in calls made to support groups, loved ones, and law-enforcement agencies.

“The coverage of this story and the many courageous voices that have spoken out have helped survivors [of sexual abuse] feel that they are not alone.”

The national discussion regarding sexual assault has also spurred a national movement on social media with the hashtag, “#MeToo” which has shed a light on the long-standing issue.

The #MeToo hashtag has been used over 200,000 times, according to the BBC, including from celebrities such as Evan Rachel Wood, Lady Gaga, and Debra Messing.

The outcry on social media comes after a number of actresses, including Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rose McGowan, have accused disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse, assault and in the case of British actor Lysette Anthony, rape.

According to the Boy Scouts of America, these brothers reached the rank of Eagle Scout “under the same conditions as their sighted peers, with no extensions or special considerations.” In fact, only four percent of Boy Scouts are able to accomplish this feat.

These triplets are competitive as well. Despite being blind, they actually love to play video games. But on this day, it’s not video games they are playing, but it’s video that is making their world a bit clearer.

With the help of Aira smart glasses and a customer support representative, these brothers are getting a sense of what is going on all around them thanks to new amazing technology made specifically for the blind. The representative, also known as a trained agent, describes to the user of the glasses what they are seeing in real-time.

The brothers are being given a free year subscription to the software as they get ready to head off to college next year. They thought the glasses were cool as they got a chance to hear what their eyes cannot see.

Mr. Sherman argued in his July impeachment resolution that President Trump committed obstruction of justice by exercising his constitutional authority as head of the executive branch. The California lawmaker said it “seems likely that the president had something to hide” regarding Russia. Here’s an idea: How about waiting for the FBI investigation to conclude?

Then there is Mr. Green, another long-serving House member without any significant accomplishments. He unveiled his competing impeachment resolution earlier this month. Among his list of Mr. Trump’s impeachable acts was disrespecting National Football League players. Overturning a national election because of crude comments about athletes who don’t stand during the anthem certainly is novel.

Then there is Ms. Waters. She said last week that the New York gala she was attending was so exciting that “with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight.” Few took this provocation literally, but even her defense sounded unhinged: “He creates controversy, he cannot get along with our members of Congress, and I’m going to continue my efforts to impeach him.” Apparently the standard for impeaching a president has shifted again: Now he can be removed from office for creating controversy and fighting with Congress.

The snapshot was taken back in 1957, but it has since become one of the most iconic photos in Hollywood history. It’s currently being featured in a new book from People Magazine titled “100 Best Celebrity Photos.”

CELEB PHOTOGRAPHER SPILLS OLD HOLLYWOOD SECRETS

“When we decided to put together a book of the 100 best celebrity photos, honestly, the first photo that came to mind was this one,” said editor-in-chief Jess Cagle Thursday.

A post shared by Martina.spadoni (@marti.spado) on Oct 25, 2017 at 1:40pm PDT

Cagle explained that back in 1957, the Italian bombshell “had signed a deal with Paramount and had come to California, and Paramount threw a big welcome party for her in Beverly Hills and Jayne Mansfield was on the guest list.”

Loren, who was supposed to be the star of the glamorous bash, wasn’t expecting Mansfield to steal the spotlight. The 83-year-old recalled that fateful evening to Entertainment Weekly in 2014.

“All of cinema was there, it was incredible,” she recalled. “And then comes in Jayne Mansfield, the last one to come. For me, that was then it got amazing.”

A post shared by Jayne Mansfield ♡ (@jaynemansfielddaily) on Jul 31, 2017 at 7:34pm PDT

That’s when their encounter took an unexpected turn.

“She came right for my table,” said Loren. “She knew everyone was watching. She sat down. And now, she was barely… Listen. Look at the picture. Where are my eyes? I’m staring at her nipples because I am afraid they are about to come onto my plate. In my face you can see the fear. I’m so frightened that everything in her dress is going to blow – BOOM! – and spill all over the table.”

Loren admitted that fans still give her the infamous photo for an autograph. However, she refuses for a very different reason.

A post shared by ♡ SOFIA VILLANI SCICOLONE ♡ (@sophialorendaily) on Aug 30, 2015 at 11:46am PDT

“[And] I never do,” said Loren. “I don’t want to have anything to do with that. And also out of respect for Jayne Mansfield because she’s not with us anymore.”

Mansfield died in 1967 from a car crash when she was 34. Her daughter, Mariska Hargitay, would go on to pursue acting and star in “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”

Loren married Italian film producer Carlo Ponti in 1957. They stayed together until his death in 2007.

The highly-anticipated video, which was released Thursday, featured a nearly-naked cyborg Swift battling within an explosive sci-fi world.

The video’s title card showed Swift’s name with a bolt of lightning in the background. Fans theorized the image was a direct jab at Harris, whom Swift dated for 15 months.

The image of lightning looked very similar to Harris’ artwork for his hit single “This Is What You Came For” which brewed some controversy between the two artists, Rolling Stone reported. Swift, who helped write the song with Harris, was credited under the pseudonym “Nils Sjoberg.”

After the couple broke up, Swift revealed she helped write the song, angering Harris, who said she unveiled the mystery to “tear her ex-boyfriend down.”

""I know you're off tour and you need someone new to bury like Katy (Perry) ETC, but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it,” Harris tweeted.

Harris claimed Swift wanted her songwriting credit to be “kept a secret,” Rolling Stone reported.

Besides the lightning bolt, fans also noticed that Swift may have taken another dig at her rival Kanye West in the video. Swift, appearing in a nude bodysuit, seemed to reference West’s “Famous” video, Billboard reported. In the rapper’s video, a number of celebrities were depicted as naked wax figures. Swift joined Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump as one of the nude figures laying on a large white bed.

Swift’s last song “Look What You Made Me Do” appeared to diss West, whom the singer has been engaged in a years-long feud.

But a cold dose of reality is not far off, as the federal government of Spain decides how harshly to deal with its rebellious citizens.

Catalonians hopped happily in the streets of their region’s capital, Barcelona, waving the banner of independence and swigging cava, the delightful local version of champagne. For them, independence is a sweet-sounding dream. They’ve been part of Spain since the 15th Century, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella married and united their lands. But Catalonia has its own language, history and traditions, and its relationship with the federal government in Madrid has always been uneasy.

For the rest of Spain, the declaration of independence is an insult to national honor. It is the equivalent of California unilaterally declaring that it is a separate country now, because its citizens don’t like President Trump. The Spanish senate declared the breakaway illegal and Catalonia’s pro-independence government illegitimate.

How tough a stand Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy decides to take against Catalonia will probably determine if what is now a dicey political situation becomes physically violent. When Catalonians tried to hold a referendum on the question of independence earlier this month, Rajoy sent the national police to disrupt the election, which he called illegal. Police smashed their way into polling stations, confiscated ballots and roughed up hundreds of would-be voters.

That infuriated Catalonians, many of whom now say they’re ready to defend their homeland with defiance, if necessary. The specter of armed police streaming into Catalonia to put down what has so far been a peaceful protest should make all Spaniards, and Europeans for that matter, act with extreme caution.

It’s unlikely that any European countries will recognize Catalonia as a sovereign state. To do so would open the door to a further dismantling of what is – in name, anyway – the European Union. Already, Britain has voted to leave. It could be just a matter of time until Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly against Brexit, decides it no longer wants to be part of the United Kingdom. The Czech Republic just elected a prime minister who dislikes centralized control from Brussels. And in Italy, the populist Northern League has set itself firmly in opposition to European control over them.

For all the dancing in the streets that Catalonians are doing now, tough days of reckoning are coming. The European Union is, in one respect, like the Mafia: once you join, you can’t leave. Or, if you try to, you’re going to pay a heavy price.","Spain on the brink: The EU has a brutal streak.

Woods was arrested in May after police found him asleep at the wheel of his car alongside a road in Florida. He was suspected of driving under the influence, police said.

His guilty plea would allow him to take part in a 12-month probation program that involves community service, DUI school, drug testing, and possible treatment. In order to avoid a DUI conviction, Woods will have to successfully complete the program.

Woods took ""full responsibility"" for his actions, the athlete said in a statement shortly after his arrest.

In an acrimonious vote, separatist lawmakers approved a motion saying they are establishing an independent Catalan Republic with 70 votes in favor, 10 against and two blank ballots.

“Today the parliament fulfilled the long-desired and fought-for step ... in the days ahead we must keep to our values of pacifism and dignity. It's in our, in your hands, to build the republic,” Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said afterwards.

In Madrid, A majority of senators gave Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy the go-ahead to apply unprecedented constitutional measures, including firing Puigdemont and his Cabinet and curtailing Catalan parliamentary powers.

Speaking outside the senate, Rajoy said what happened in Catalonia was “proof” that invoking Article 155 was “necessary.” He called the parliament’s independence vote “illegal” and a “delinquent act.”

The Catalan motion calls for beginning an independence process that includes drafting Catalonia's new top laws and opening negotiations ""on equal footing"" with Spanish authorities to establish cooperation.

It was boycotted by opposition lawmakers who left the chamber in protest. Outside, thousands of pro-independence Catalans cheered as the results were announced.

In a tweet soon after the results were announced, Rajoy called for “tranquility” in the Catalan region and promised “the rule of law will restore legality.”

Spain’s central government opposes the independence bid and it is readying measures to take over control of the northeastern region. No country has expressed support for the secession bid.

The U.S. State Department said Friday it stands in support of Spain's government in its efforts to stop Catalonia's independence bid.

""Catalonia is an integral part of Spain, and the United States supports the Spanish government's constitutional measures to keep Spain strong and united,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

European Council President Donald Tusk said it would continue to only deal with Spain.

“For [the EU] nothing changes. Spain remains our only interlocutor. I hope the Spanish government favors force of argument, not argument of force.”

A spokesman with Spain's prosecutor office, meanwhile, said the prosecutor would seek rebellion charges for those responsible for the Catalan independence vote.

The prosecutor was looking to determine if only the Catalan cabinet, including Puigdemont and Junqueras, will be charged, or if the target that would also include members of the parliament's governing board and lawmakers, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity following internal rules.

He said the charges could be brought as early as Monday.

Under Spanish criminal law, rebellion can be punished by up to 25 years in prison, with shorter penalties if the rebellion doesn't lead to violence.

It will be the first time in four decades of democratic rule that the Madrid-based national government would directly run the affairs of one of Spain's 17 semi-autonomous regions, a move that will likely fan the flames of the Catalan revolt.

Catalonia represents a fifth of Spain's gross domestic product. Polls show its 7.5 million inhabitants are roughly evenly divided over independence.

The artwork included cartoon characters shaped like corn kernels frolicking about in a shopping mall. All but one of the kernels was yellow. The lone brown kernel was working as a janitor.

A number of folks observed that the brown kernel was the only one actually doing something – putting in a hard day’s work while other corn kernels goofed off.

I contend it’s just a cartoon on a cereal box, so why is this even a “thing”? But my opinion seems to be in the minority (no pun intended).

Kellogg's dutifully responded on Twitter - reaffirming its commitment to diversity and inclusion. In other words, they respect corn kernels of all colors and socio-economic backgrounds.

""Kellogg is committed to diversity & inclusion. We did not intend to offend - we apologize. The artwork is updated & will be in stores soon,"" the company stated.

Weinstein's lawsuit filed Thursday in Delaware seeks access to the records, which Weinstein's lawyers argue are key to the Oscar-winner's defense from the avalanche of harassment claims made against him since an Oct. 5 report by The New York Times. Weinstein was fired from The Weinstein Co. three days later. His lawsuit makes clear that if he is able to obtain the records, he may use them to pursue a wrongful termination case or other legal actions against the company.

The lawsuit notes the numerous legal troubles facing Weinstein and his former company, including criminal investigations, a civil lawsuit that alleges The Weinstein Co. knew of decades of harassment allegations lodged against the producer and a civil rights investigation launched by the New York attorney general.

""Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account — which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company — will contain information exonerating him, and therefore the company, from claims that may be asserted against him or the company. Further, Mr. Weinstein is in a unique position to offer insight, and further explain and contextualize his emails.""

Weinstein is asking a judge to expedite a ruling on his case.

A representative for The Weinstein Co. did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment.

The lawsuit came hours after actress Ashley Judd described on-camera Weinstein's sexual advances toward her, which she said she escaped by making a deal.

She was a rising young actress two decades ago who had arrived at the hotel suite of this powerful film mogul for what she thought would be a business meeting.

It wasn't, she said in her first on-camera recounting of the incident, which aired Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" Judd's account of the incident three weeks ago in The New York Times was a key factor in Weinstein's downfall, and opened the door to an avalanche of harassment allegations against Weinstein and others and a broader cultural discussion of how women are treated in the workplace and beyond.

NBC suspended Mark Halperin on Thursday after CNN reported on the claims of five women who said the political journalist harassed them while he was an ABC News executive. Halperin, who co-authored the best-seller ""Game Change,"" apologized Wednesday for what he called inappropriate behavior. And former Fox News host and best-selling author Bill O'Reilly, who was forced out of the network in April after sexual harassment allegations, saw his literary agency cut ties with him.

Fallout continues to Weinstein and the film production company he co-founded. The Lexus luxury vehicle brand said Thursday it was ending its partnership with The Weinstein Co., which included sponsorship and product placement in company's ""Project Runway"" television show.

Weinstein has been fired from the company he co-founded with his brother and is now facing criminal investigations in London, New York and Los Angeles.

ABC is spreading its interview with Judd throughout its programming Thursday, with segments expected to air during its nightly newscast and its ""Nightline"" late-night show.

In the ""GMA"" interview, Judd said the business meeting in Weinstein's hotel room turned into a negotiation not about work, but about things the producer wanted the actress to do to him.

Weinstein first offered to give her a massage, then, when she demurred, asked her to give him one, she said.

""I fought with this volley of no's,"" she said.

Then she made a ""deal."" She said she agreed to submit to him, but only ""when I win an Oscar in one of your movies — OK?""

""When you get NOMINATED,"" Weinstein counter-offered.

""And I said, 'No. When I WIN an Oscar.' And then I just fled.""

Judd said she remains of two minds about how she handled the shocking situation.

""Am I proud of that? . The part that shames myself says, 'No.' The part of me that understands the way shame works says, 'That was absolutely brilliant. Good job, kid, you got out of there. Well done!'""

Judd said a couple of years after the hotel encounter she was seated across from Weinstein at a dinner. She said he brought up ""that little agreement we made,"" and claimed he was ""looking around for the material.""

Then he looked at her and said, ""You know, Ashley, I'm going to let you out of that little agreement that we made.""

Judd said by then ""I had come into my own, I had come into my power, I had found my voice. And I said, 'You do that, Harvey. You DO that.'

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

The society’s president, John Runions, told the Journal-Register that the box is “a great link” to Lincoln for the small community outside the state capitol of Springfield.

The revelation has sparked a frenzy among Republicans who have called for more information on just how involved former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in the production of the unverified dossier.

Here’s what to know about the firm and its connection to the Russia investigations.

What is Fusion GPS?

Founded by veteran journalists, Fusion GPS “provides premium research, strategic intelligence, and due diligence services to corporations, law firms and investors worldwide,” according to its sparse website.

The Washington, D.C.-based firm also says it offers a “cross-disciplinary approach with expertise in media, politics, regulation, national security, and global markets.”

Fusion GPS was started in 2009 by former Wall Street Journal reporters Peter Fritsch and Glenn Simpson.

How is Fusion GPS linked to the Russia investigation?

The political firm was behind the controversial dossier that contained a number of colorful but unverifiable claims about Trump. The company retained British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who produced the 35-page dossier.

FUSION GPS LINK TO DEMOCRATS MURKY BY DESIGN

While it has not been verified, the dossier, which included explicit sexual and financial allegations against Trump, created further speculation about any Trump connection to Russian officials – a question that has dogged his campaign and presidency.

Who funded the dossier?

The firm was originally retained during the election by an unidentified client who wanted opposition research on Trump. While the donor has not been identified, the president told Fox Business that he believes he knows who it is.

After Trump became the GOP presidential nominee, Clinton and the DNC retained Fusion GPS through lawyer Marc Elias and his firm, Perkins Coie, Fox News confirmed.

Clinton reportedly did not know about the dossier until BuzzFeed News published it in January 2017. Democrats have defended it as simply opposition research.

TRUMP AND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: WHAT TO KNOW

It's unclear what Fusion GPS had dug up by the time Perkins Coie hired them, or how much money was involved in the transaction. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Perkins Coie more than $9 million – although it’s uncertain how much of that money, if any, went toward the dossier.

The Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the project until October 2016 – right before the election.

Trump has suggested that the dossier was funded by Russia, Democrats, the FBI or all of them.

Anything else?

Simpson has done substantial investigative work on the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after reporting a massive tax fraud scheme. Magnitsky died in prison, and the U.S. enacted the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on certain Russian officials.

During the campaign, Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, took a controversial meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton. Instead, those who went to the meeting said she just wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act.

In his investigative work on Magnitsky, Simpson may have found evidence that contradicts details of the case accepted by the U.S., NBC News reported.

Fusion GPS also did work as a firm related to the Magnitsky Act.

By Kimberley A. Strassel, The Wall Street Journal



The confirmation this week that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid an opposition-research firm for a “dossier” on Donald Trump is bombshell news. More bombshells are to come.

The Fusion GPS saga isn’t over. The Clinton-DNC funding is but a first glimpse into the shady election doings concealed within that oppo-research firm’s walls. We now know where Fusion got some of its cash, but the next question is how the firm used it. With whom did it work beyond former British spy Christopher Steele ? Whom did it pay? Who else was paying it?

The answers are in Fusion’s bank records. Fusion has doggedly refused to divulge the names of its clients for months now, despite extraordinary pressure. So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?

Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.

If the House wins, don’t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.’s office.

FBI bombshells are also yet to come. The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news. On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.

Assuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team—despite reading like “the National Enquirer,” as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it. We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway. Or that it didn’t know, which would be equally disturbing.",The Coming Russia Bombshells,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/27/coming-russia-bombshells#commenting

Researchers named the star Kronos, after the Titan of Greek mythology who ate his own children out of fears they'd dethrone him, according to a statement from Princeton University. Kronos belongs to a binary star system, or double-star system, located 350 light-years from Earth.

Astronomers discovered the star's ravenous habits while comparing its chemical composition to that of its stellar twin, named Krios — the Greek Titan god of the constellations and Kronos' older brother. The results showed that Kronos had an unusually high level of rock-forming minerals, suggesting it feasted on roughly 15 Earth masses' worth of rocky planets in its lifetime, according to the study. [Gallery: Dying Stars Consume Rocky Alien Planets]

Both stars — designated as HD 240430 and HD 240429, respectively — are approximately 4 billion years old, and they appear to be yellow G-type stars, similar to (but slightly younger than) the sun. Observations also showed that the stars orbit each other once every 10,000 years or so, according to the study.

At first, astronomers questioned whether the two stars were in fact a binary pair, because they are located a whopping two light-years apart. But further research confirmed that the co-moving stars have the same radial velocities. Their movements toward and away from Earth match — a key indicator of a binary star system, according to the statement.

What is most surprising about the stellar duo is that they are composed of drastically different materials. The study revealed that Kronos had an unusually high level of minerals such as magnesium, aluminum, silicon, iron, chromium and yttrium — metals that make up the bulk of rocky planets such as Earth. However, the ravenous star did not have an equally high level of volatile compounds, which are most often found in gas form, like oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and potassium, according to the statement.

Most metal-rich stars ""have all the other elements enhanced at a similar level, whereas Kronos has volatile elements suppressed, which makes it really weird in the general context of stellar abundance patterns,"" Semyeong Oh, a graduate student at Princeton and lead author of the study, said in the statement.

The abundance of rock-forming minerals was concentrated in Kronos' outer layers, rather than mixed throughout the star. Furthermore, the researchers confirmed that the types of minerals in the outer layers of the star solidify at warmer temperatures — a characteristic of rocky planets, which form closer to their parent star than gas giants do.

Therefore, Kronos likely consumed 15 Earth-mass planets in order to gain the unusual abundance of rock-forming minerals, the researchers said; otherwise, the star would have a higher abundance of volatiles from gobbling up gas giants.

""All of the elements that would make up a rocky planet are exactly the elements that are enhanced on Kronos,"" Oh said. ""And the volatile elements are not enhanced, so that provides a strong argument for a planet engulfment scenario, instead of something else.""

The study also provides new insight into stellar formation and exoplanets.

""At the moment, we are still at the stage of piecing together different observations to determine how and when exoplanets form,"" said Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research.

""It's difficult to directly observe planet formation around young stars — they are typically shrouded in dust, and the stars themselves are very active, which makes it hard to disentangle any signals from the planets,"" Christiansen said. ""So we have to infer what we can from the limited information we have. If borne out, this new window onto the masses and compositions of the material in the early stages of planetary systems may provide crucial constraints for planet formation theories.""

“We’re the keeper of the history.”Not all cemeteries, however, are as open to housing Confederate statues as Greenwood is.","While the public outcry over statues and monuments honoring Robert E. Lee, “Stonewall” Jackson and other Confederate soldiers has quieted down since the summer, the question about what to do with their recently-removed memorials still lingers.

Some are collecting dust in warehouses while officials search for a new home for them. Some are being handed over to the same associations that commissioned them over a hundred years ago or plopped down in cemeteries that are the final resting place for Confederate dead. One massive monument has found a new home along the banks of the Ohio River in a Kentucky historical park.

A 70-foot concrete plinth honoring Confederate soldiers had for years drawn criticism from students and faculty at the University of Louisville before it was taken down earlier this year and moved about 45 miles to Brandenburg. The monument was placed in the town’s historical walk alongside other historical statues.

Brandenburg Mayor Ronnie Joyner told Fox News that the town was not trying to honor the Confederate cause by accepting the plinth, but instead wanted to represent another aspect of American history at their outdoor museum.

“This is not a black versus white issue or something to honor the Confederacy,” Joyner said. “We’ve had the history walk since 2000 and we have statues of Native Americans and the Underground Railroad.”

Joyner added that the town has also modified the plinth with new plaques to make it a memorial to both Union and Confederate soldiers.

As for accepting any more Confederate statues, Joyner said Brandenburg won’t be taking more unless the controversy dies down. He did, however, make one exception.

“I would like to have a statue of John Hunt Morgan, but that is because he was active in these parts,” Joyner said in reference to the Confederate general who led a highly publicized raid across the Ohio River into Indiana and Ohio in 1863.

Along with historic parks, cemeteries where Confederate soldiers are buried have become another home for the removed statues.

Orlando city officials in June moved a statue known as “Johnny Reb” to a section of the nearby Greenwood Cemetery where 37 Confederate soldiers are interred.

“This is the Confederate section of the cemetery so, historically, it belongs here,” Don Price, sexton for the cemetery, told the Orlando Sentinel. “We’re the keeper of the history.”

Not all cemeteries, however, are as open to housing Confederate statues as Greenwood is.

Following the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia this summer over the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever Cemetery removed its monument commemorating Confederate veterans.

Many of the cheaper, concrete statues to the Confederacy were commissioned in the early decades of last century by hereditary groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and – since the call for the removal of these monuments started up – the organizations have been taking the statues back.

In the college town of Gainesville, Fla., the United Daughters of the Confederacy were given a statue of a Confederate soldier known as “Ole Joe” earlier this year after a local history museum declined to accept it and a veterans group objected to its transfer to a nearby park. The UDC, a group that has been accused of supporting white supremacist ideas, erected the monument in 1904 in front of the Alachua County courthouse.

While some of these statues have found new homes, many more have been tucked away in warehouses in cities and towns across the U.S. as municipalities figure out what to do with them.

In Baltimore, which furtively took down a massive bronze statue of Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson in August amid threats that activists would tear them down, officials have been mulling over what to do with the memorial.

A number of universities and museums have been approached about taking the statue, but so far the city has not been able to find a suitable home for it – a fact that has been an annoyance to the Maryland state agency that oversees historical monuments.

“While the Trustees appreciate that the issues concerning relocation are complex, they also believe that establishing benchmarks are imperative to seeing this matter through to resolution,” Elizabeth Hughes, director of the Maryland Historical Trust, wrote in letter obtained by the Baltimore Sun. Hughes asked that the city find somewhere to put the monuments within nine months and secure their installation at the new location within 18 months.","Confederate statues find new homes in cemeteries, historical parks and warehouses",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/confederate-statues-find-new-homes-in-cemeteries-historical-parks-and-warehouses.html

The head of the Democratic Party suggested as much during a forum at the University of Chicago earlier this week.

While defending the Fusion GPS dossier as standard opposition research, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez maintained he only learned about the dossier “a few days ago” – before explaining how his predecessors at the DNC could have set up such a project.

“You hire a lawyer – and we hire lawyers all the time who hire third-party vendors to do their work – and so we knew that we were paying for opposition research at the DNC, but we didn’t ask questions about who they’re hiring in the context of doing their research,” Perez told The Washington Post’s Karen Tumulty, when asked to explained how he could have been in the dark.

Perez, who was not at the DNC at the time, went on to defend the party’s efforts, saying “we had very strong reason to believe that Donald Trump and the Donald Trump campaign and the Russians were potentially conspiring to affect the election.”

The controversial dossier contained unverified and lurid allegations about dirt the Russians had on then-candidate Donald Trump and his campaign’s possible connections to Moscow.

The Washington Post reported this earlier week — and Fox News confirmed — that the political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous dossier.

DEMS' DOSSIER DENIALS PILE UP

According to the report, the Clinton campaign and DNC paid more than $9 million to Elias’ firm Perkins Coie that, in turn, retained the political consultants who commissioned the research. Before that, the research was backed by an unknown Republican client.

But it’s unclear how much of that $9 million went toward the dossier. And it’s unclear who exactly at the Clinton campaign and DNC might have known how it was being spent.

Perez and then-DNC leader Debbie Wasserman Schultz have denied knowledge. So have Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman John Podesta and spokesman Brian Fallon. And while Clinton herself has not spoken publicly on the matter, sources have sought to distance her from the dossier in news reports.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told Fox News’ “Outnumbered Overtime” that the careful distance between the research and the political entities that helped fund it only underscores the need to “connect the dots.”

“There were so many in-between groups used to sort of shield direct control that it’s very clear that people on the one end, Russia, and on the other end, the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign – they obviously wanted to create the inability to connect the dots. And when somebody goes through so many efforts through so many surrogates to keep that from happening, you have a special reason to want to connect the dots,” he said Thursday.

To what extent Russia might have been involved is unclear.

But more details could emerge soon, as Fusion GPS fights in court to keep its bank records on lockdown.

Wall Street Journal editorial board member Kimberley Strassel wrote that the disclosure of the DNC-Clinton connection suggests “there's something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more” in those records.

“If the House wins, don't be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.'s office,” Strassel wrote.

President Trump has reveled in the recent revelations – including renewed scrutiny of a 2010 Obama-era uranium deal involving a Russian firm – using them to fuel his claims that the investigations into Russian collusion with his campaign are baseless.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” Trump tweeted Friday.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on “Fox & Friends” that she doesn’t know which GOP candidate started backing Fusion but said Steele only got involved after the Democrats stepped in.

“Democrats have not been transparent or honest about how this started,” she said Friday.

In another twist, CNN reported that former Clinton campaign chairman Podesta privately denied any knowledge of the payment arrangement in recent interviews with congressional investigators.

“Here in Palm Beach County, first-time DUI offenders have the option to knock it down to a reckless driving charge, knock it down to a reckless charge, enter a pre-trial diversion program, where they have probation, and if they complete the program successfully, adjudication can be withheld and they can actually have their record expunged. However if their record is expunged, and they get another DUI, that doesn't allow them to enter this pre-trial diversion again,” Kranz said. “There is no celebrity privilege here.”

At the end of May at about 3 a.m., Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies pulled up alongside Woods, who was parked curiously on the side of the road, asleep.

During his roadside sobriety test, Woods slurred, couldn’t walk a straight line, appeared very “out of it” and was taken to the station where he could barely keep his eyes open and struggled to blow into the breathalyzer.

That test showed no alcohol in Woods’ system, 0.0. A toxicology test, instead, showed a bunch of prescription drugs, Vicadin, Xanax, Ambien, Dilaudid as well as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Woods has had four back surgeries in the past three years, most recently fusion surgery in April.

After the arrest, Woods went to an out-of-state rehab center, which he’s tweeted helped him better manage his medications and dosages.

Emma Rodriguez, 27, had faced life in prison without parole. She pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence, according to reports.

The sentencing was held Thursday in San Antonio.

“I was frustrated at the time,” Rodriguez told Judge Kevin O’Connell, according to KSAT-TV. “She kept crying.”

San Antonio police found Beautiful Rodriquez unconscious in her crib in 2015, according to the station.

Rodriguez admitted to violently slapping her daughter and then tossing her into a crib, causing her death, the station reported.

She was pregnant at the time and caring for seven children, including Beautiful.

Beautiful was killed right after she and her siblings were returned to Rodriguez’s custody, the station reported.

She sought their return after the kids were placed in foster care by the Texas agency that investigates reports of abuse and neglect of children, according to the station.

“There is forever a hole in our hearts that can never filled,” the station quoted Beautiful’s foster mother as saying at the sentencing. “Life for is will never be quite as beautiful as it was when the sweet, innocent little girl was in it.”

Rodriquez's defense attorney asked the judge for a more lenient sentence of 20-years in prison.

“It’s a tragedy for everybody,” attorney Edward Bartolomie said, according to the San Antonio Express-News. “She came from an extremely abused background; (Child Protective Services) has been involved in her life since she was 2; she used drugs.”

Bartolomie told the paper that Rodriquez gave birth to her eighth child in jail and relinquished her rights to all the children, all of whom have since been placed in homes.",Texas woman sentenced to 45 years in prison in beating death of 2-year-old daughter,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/texas-woman-sentenced-to-45-years-in-prison-in-beating-death-2-year-old-daughter.html

It was Preston’s third movie role; she was 20 during filming.","Stephen King taught us some important lessons while ascending to his rightful place as America’s most prolific author of horror and supernatural fiction. For instance: don’t dump pig’s blood on Carrie, never stay at The Shining’s Overlook Hotel (Here’s Johnny!”), and for goodness’ sake, tread lightly when dealing with a 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine.

King’s characters didn’t have the benefit of hindsight, however, and their misfortunes still haunt many of us to this day. And for classic car lovers, no King story resonates quite like the “fear on four wheels” that we experienced on the pages of Christine—or better yet, in the 1983 film of the same name (let’s not talk about the 2016 remake). Even the original movie trailer raises the hair on the backs of our necks.

King takes the classic tale of boy-meets-girl to frightening heights when a geeky teenager named Arnie falls for a red Plymouth Fury with a sketchy past. Christine falls hard for Arnie, too, which would be roses and balloon drops if it weren’t for one tiny detail: the car is a killing machine with a long memory and a short fuse. Moral of the story: Never underestimate the fury of a Fury, particularly one that just…won’t…die.

As we hand out Halloween candy to all the little ghosts and goblins out there, here’s a little something for big kids: 10 things you may not know about the original Christine movie:

1 - More than 20 cars were required to play the role of Christine (anywhere from 23–28, depending on the source), and not all of them were Furys. Columbia Pictures placed ads across the country and gobbled up not only Furys, but Belvederes and Savoys, as well. The majority were used on screen, and the rest served as parts cars.

2 - When filming wrapped, only a few unscathed cars remained, and they went on the road to promote the film before being sold to collectors. A fourth car also escaped the crusher and ended up in private hands. One of the movie cars sold for $198,000 at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction in January 2015. By comparison, our Hagerty Valuation Tool lists the average value of a 1958 Plymouth Fury in #2 (excellent) condition at $47,700.

3 - King said he chose a 1958 Plymouth Fury as the story’s central figure because it was a “forgotten car.” The fact that the model name seems to fit its angry disposition is purely coincidental. “I didn’t want a car that already had a legend attached to it, like the ’50s Thunderbird,” King said.

4 - The movie’s opening scene, showing Christine moving along a Detroit assembly line, wasn’t in King’s book; screenwriter Bill Phillips added it. The movie, by the way, went into production before the novel was released.

5 - Whenever Christine goes into a rage, the car’s windows are blacked out to accentuate its evilness, but the darkened glass also served a higher purpose—you couldn’t see the stunt driver. The problem was, those scenes were filmed primarily at night, which made it even more difficult for the driver to see.

6 - The illusion of Christine regenerating herself was created using hydraulic pumps inside the car that were attached to the sides of a plastic-paneled body double. The pumps sucked in the sides to create the damaged version of the car, and then the film was reversed, making it appear like the car was fixing itself.

7 - The sound we hear from Christine’s engine isn’t a Plymouth Fury. Filmmakers recorded the engine of a 1970 Mustang 428 Super Cobra Jet and used that instead.

8 - Speaking of memorable sounds, the F-word was used a lot in the dialogue, reportedly because executives thought no one would pay to see a horror film if it was rated PG, and there wasn’t enough violence to warrant an R rating.

9 - Partly to save money, filmmakers cast unknowns in the lead roles, although Scott Baio and Brooke Shields were originally considered. Some better-known actors and actresses (recognizable today, at least) appeared in the film, including Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky, and Kelly Preston. It was Preston’s third movie role; she was 20 during filming. Kevin Bacon, virtually unknown at the time, was offered the lead role of Arnie, but he chose to play Ren McCormack in the blockbuster Footloose instead. Well, that certainly worked out well.

10 - If watching Christine gives you a sense of déjà vu, it’s because director John Carpenter also filmed 1978’s Halloween in the same neighborhood in South Pasadena, California, five years earlier. (Incidentally, Carpenter refused to attend Christine’s premiere, thinking his presence might be bad luck.)",Fear on wheels: 10 things you may not know about Christine,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/27/fear-on-wheels-10-things-may-not-know-about-christine.html

The artwork included cartoon characters shaped like corn kernels frolicking about in a shopping mall. All but one of the kernels was yellow. The lone brown kernel was working as a janitor.

Well, faster than you could say snap, crackle, pop -- a customer raised a stink on social media.

A number of folks observed that the brown kernel was the only one actually doing something – putting in a hard day’s work while other corn kernels goofed off.

I contend it’s just a cartoon on a cereal box, so why is this even a “thing”? But my opinion seems to be in the minority (no pun intended).

Kellogg's dutifully responded on Twitter - reaffirming its commitment to diversity and inclusion. In other words, they respect corn kernels of all colors and socio-economic backgrounds.

""Kellogg is committed to diversity & inclusion. We did not intend to offend - we apologize. The artwork is updated & will be in stores soon,"" the company stated.

And for the sake of inclusivity, I imagine Kellogg's would affirm vegetables that identify as corn kernels or corn kernels that might be yellow but identify as brown. I mean who are we to judge if a head of lettuce identifies as a corn kernel?

Folks, the country has gone plumb nuts.

The notion that a major American company was forced to apologize after somebody got their flakes frosted by a cartoon corn kernel demonstrates just how perpetually offended and overly sensitive we've become.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real.
It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem.
Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power.
The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.","Yet another anti-male group has emerged, this time in Washington D.C. It’s called Rethink Masculinity, and it is billed as a community where “people identifying as men” learn how social constructs of masculinity are harmful and then subsequently work to construct “healthier” ways to be men. The program joins a host of other like-minded initiatives, most of which are on college campuses—such as the Men’s Project at the University of Wisconsin, Masculinity 101 at Brown, and the Duke Men’s Project.

The goal of these programs is always the same: “to help men examine their own biases and behaviors in order to cut down on misogyny and gender-based violence,” writes Olivia Campbell at New York magazine.

Adds Campbell, “There’s no doubt the problems these classes aim to tackle are pervasive ones — a reality that’s been made especially, painfully clear in recent days and weeks, as the Harvey Weinstein revelations have pushed discussions of sexual assault and harassment to the forefront. But can a class really be enough to chip away at something so deeply entrenched?”

Probably not, notes Eric Mankowski, associate chair of the psychology department at Portland State University. “A single class is unlikely to undo years of socialization in toxic masculinity.”

Years of socialization in toxic masculinity. Right, because the recent events regarding men behaving badly, whether in the media, in Hollywood, or even on college campuses, couldn’t possibly be anything but that.

All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem. It means power is.

It couldn’t possibly be that the stories about which we’re far too privy represent the basest of the base—individual human beings who lack basic decency and character and who do not represent an entire sex. It couldn’t be that we know too much for our own good and at the same time know nothing specific about the events themselves. It couldn’t be that women on campus or in Hollywood or in the media are culpable in any way—because we all know women are always innocent and men, well, are not. It couldn’t be that those bastions of left-wing groupthink in all three of these arenas are, by their very nature, corrupt.

Because out here in the middle of the country, that vast area between the two coasts where most Americans live, healthy masculinity abounds. Out here in the middle of the country, where regular people live regular lives, masculine men are in fact quite lovely. They love and respect women. They love their country and their families. They’re good husbands and fathers who would never dream of forsaking it all for a romp in the hay.

And the women? They love and respect men, too—as they are, not as they “should” be. They also know how to take care of themselves and say no to bad behavior. They don’t put up with nonsense from men unless they want the nonsense. And if they do, they own it. Because they know women are as flawed as men.

That is not to suggest nothing bad happens between New York and California. It is only to say that “toxic masculinity” isn’t the problem. Greed, power and corruption—which dominate on the Coasts—is the problem. When you throw those elements into the mix, both sexes get into trouble. Women in high positions of power can be just as ruthless as men in power. The only reason we don’t hear about them is because there are far fewer women in power.

It’s time to call a spade a spade. All the recent news about powerful men abusing their power is real. But our focus is misplaced. Of course such men are disgusting. Of course they’re wrong and should be called out. But that doesn’t mean masculinity is the problem.

It means power is.

So what’s the answer? Either stay away from environments that are clearly corrupt and opt for a clean, simple life instead. Or go for it and know what you’re getting into. And the second you smell something untoward, which you will, do what Angelina Jolie did: “I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.”

In other words, you can be smart or you can be desperate. If you’re desperate for power, you will inevitably become part of the madness. If you’re smart and play your cards right, as Mayim Bialik explains in this essay, you may—may—rise above the fray.

In a perfect world, power wouldn’t cause people to behave like animals instead of like humans. But we don’t live in such a world. And here’s the most important part: none of us can change this fact. It’s human nature at its ugliest, and we can’t control it.

You can spend your life trying if you like.

But I wouldn’t recommend it.",Masculinity isn't the problem. Power is,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/26/masculinity-isnt-problem-power-is.html

Investigators had interviewed a man who owns a white van seen in the neighborhood at the time of the shooting. Media reports indicated Pickert recently won a $5.75 million judgment against that man. But police spokeswoman Kari Thompson said Thursday the man is not a suspect in Pickert's death.

Thompson provided no other details about the investigation, according to The Associated Press.

So why did the firm suddenly insist that middleman law firm Perkins Coie release Fusion from confidentiality agreements, and spill the beans on who hired it?

Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.

If the House wins, don’t be surprised if those records include money connected to Russians. In the past Fusion has worked with Russians, including lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who happened to show up last year in Donald Trump Jr.’s office.

FBI bombshells are also yet to come. The bureau has stonewalled congressional subpoenas for documents related to the dossier, but that became harder with the DNC-Clinton news. On Thursday Speaker Paul Ryan announced the FBI had finally pledged to turn over its dossier file next week.

Assuming the FBI is comprehensive in its disclosure, expect to learn that the dossier was indeed a major basis of investigating the Trump team—despite reading like “the National Enquirer,” as Rep. Trey Gowdy aptly put it. We may learn the FBI knew the dossier was a bought-and-paid-for product of Candidate Clinton, but used it anyway. Or that it didn’t know, which would be equally disturbing.",The Coming Russia Bombshells,http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/10/27/coming-russia-bombshells

While many of her followers took time to congratulate the mom-to-be, others decided to slam the 29-year-old for her tiny frame.

PREGNANT FITNESS MODEL SHAMED FOR FLAT STOMACH RESPONDS TO SOCIAL MEDIA CRITICS

“The worst comments have to be the ones along the lines of, ‘No more baby in that belly,’ or ‘Start eating more so your baby can grow,’” she said.

Kousoukas has a medical condition that causes her uterus to grow “backwards,” she says in her caption explaining why her baby bump looks the way it does.

“For the first four months of my pregnancy, my uterus was retroverted/tilted, which means that I was growing backwards into my body rather than outwards,” her caption reads.

A post shared by Yiota Kouzoukas (@yiota) on Oct 1, 2017 at 2:12am PDT

While a fetus cannot grow “backwards,” reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at CCRM Boston, Dr. Aaron Styer, points out, a backward tilt of the uterus can skew the size of a baby bump.

The common condition – affecting about one in five pregnant women – is “normal and does not increase a woman’s risk for infertility or miscarriage,” Dr. Styer says. But it is just one of the factors Kousoukas is dealing with in her pregnancy, which she explained on Instagram “for the reason of educating” people on the differences people experience during pregnancy.

“My uterus didn’t 'flip forward' until well into being 4 months pregnant because of the backwards tilted position paired with decade old endometriosis scarring that I have on my uterosacral ligaments. Basically, these ligaments are acting like anchors keeping my uterus 'inside' rather than 'outside', which is why I appeared smaller than most people for the first 4 or 5 months.”

A post shared by Yiota Kouzoukas (@yiota) on Oct 22, 2017 at 3:41pm PDT

Now the Australian influencer said she is “growing forwards” in her sixth month while “the scarring on [her] ligaments slowly breaks down.”

Kousoukas, who explains, “Social media has caused a shift that leads everyone to fixate on bump size rather than the health of the baby and mom to be,” is confident in her pregnancy and concludes her post with the important point: “I’m perfectly healthy, my baby is perfectly healthy, and that’s all that matters.

Vineyard 48, a winery on Long Island, agreed Wednesday to permanently shut its doors after the New York State Liquor Authority suspended its license to serve alcohol on Oct. 5.

The NYSLA said the business repeatedly served extremely intoxicated customers to the point where it strained local police services and caused “havoc” for neighbors.

Some of that “havoc” involved a rowdy party allegedly hosted at the business on Sept. 30 in which patrons got into fist fights, had sex in public and defecated on the neighbor’s lawns.

The liquor authority stated at the time that police went to the winery due to “an altercation involving 400 disorderly, heavily intoxicated patrons who were pushing, shoving and screaming at one another.”

Southold Town Police reportedly received calls from neighbors about “two patrons engaging in sexual acts in view of their backyard bordering Vineyard 48.” Other customers also reportedly defecated and urinated on a nearby homeowner’s lawn due to long bathroom lines at the business.

The sentence the military judge will impose on Tali-Bowe Bergdahl isn’t about one self-centered deserter. It’s about our national defense.

Steyer, a staunch environmentalist and Trump critic, launched a $10 million national campaign ad calling for the president’s impeachment last week.

The one-minute ad calls Trump “mentally unstable [and] armed with nuclear weapons.” It accuses the president of obstructing justice in his firing of former FBI Director James Comey, violating the Constitution, taking money from foreign governments and threatening to shut down press organizations.

“Like you, I’m a citizen who knows it’s up to us to do something,” Steyer said in the ad, sending viewers to the website NeedToImpeach.com.

Congressional Democrats like Reps. Brad Sherman of California, Al Green of Texas and Waters also have called for the president’s impeachment.

Steyer and his super PAC, back in 2014, reportedly sought to raise $100 million to elect allies in the climate change fight – though they fell short of that goal, Steyer later denied setting it and Republicans went on to gain control of the Senate and pick up seats in the House and local races.",Trump slams 'unhinged' billionaire Steyer after impeachment ad,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/trump-slams-unhinged-billionaire-steyer-after-impeachment-ad.html

But she’s hoping that with LACMA opening a show on 18th-century artwork next month, Española’s owner might reach out again.","A painting by famed 18th century Mexican artist Miguel Cabrera – long believed lost to history - may have been hanging in obscurity on the wall of a Los Angeles home for the last 60 years.

The artwork, nicknamed “Española,” is the only missing piece from the 16 Cabrera did in a series of casta, or caste, paintings. The painting's location remained a mystery for decades, until two years ago, when Ilona Katzew, the curator of Latin American art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, received a cryptic letter written in the voice of the little girl featured in the artwork.

“You should know that I am well and living less than two (2) miles from LACMA,” Española wrote in the letter to Katzew, the Los Angeles Times reported. “I have been in the same family for I believe 60 years, although I do not know how I was acquired.”

Since opening the letter, Katzew has puzzled over where in that two mile radius “Española” is hiding, but clues to the painting’s whereabouts are few and far between.

The three-paragraph letter gave no more indication of the painting’s location or means of contacting the owner. The mailing label was trimmed down to remove any information about its origin. The postage was a pair of 37-cent stamps – retired a decade before the letter was sent – and a commemorative stamp honoring writer Jack London that was issued in 1988.

Five photos of the painting – the only ones known to exist of the work - were also included with the letter, but the only information that Katzew was able to glean from them was that the artwork was in a modern frame and that it was apparently hanging high on a wall.

In the letter, however, Española hints that she would be willing go on display “for a limited period of time” if the conditions were right.

“If you ever gather a reunion of all my siblings, I would welcome the opportunity to be on display for a limited period of time,” the letter noted. “I am not lost, I just do not wish to be found.”

The 16 paintings in Cabrera’s casta series – an art style that explored interracial marriages and children in the Spain’s New World colonies – were purportedly sent to Spain from Mexico shortly after the artist’s death and displayed in the home of the Viceroy of New Spain, Joaquin de Montserrat.

In 2015, 14 of the painting were housed in museums across the U.S., Spain and Mexico. The most recently discovered one – a painting of a Spanish father, his half-Spanish, half-African wife, and their albino baby – was found under a couch in a northern California home and quickly obtained by LACMA.

“My owner has enjoyed seeing #6,” Española’s letter said in reference to the most recently acquired painting, “and I am pleased that we are all now accounted for despite the diaspora.”

But it’s been two years since the most recent Cabrera was acquired – and since Española’s letter – and Katzew hasn’t had any other contact with the painting’s owner.

Following a Cabinet meeting, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he is dissolving the parliament and will hold new regional elections in Catalonia in December.

Catalonia’s regional parliament passed a motion earlier Friday to establish itself as an independent Catalan Republic.

Immediately after the independence decision, Spain's Senate authorized the government to invoke a never-before used constitutional measure to take control of the Catalonia region. The measure gives Spain the ability to sack Catalonia President Carles Puigdemont and his Cabinet as well as authorize the government to curtail the region's parliamentary powers.

Catalonia's motion called for beginning an independence process that would include drafting Catalonia’s new laws as well as open negotiations “on equal footing” with Spanish authorities.

What is Catalonia?

Located in the northeast region of Spain, Catalonia is largely independent with its own culture and language. It’s one of the richest and most industrialized areas of the country with a heavy emphasis on manufacturing, according to the BBC.

The region, which includes Barcelona, is home to about 7.5 million people.

Valuing its autonomy, Catalonia has its own parliament and executive, called “Generalitat” in its language.

Why do they want independence?

Because of its own cultural identity, those in favor of Catalan independence have pushed for the region to become separate from Spain. Supporters also believe that they have given more to the Spanish government than they have gotten back.

The push for independence “raises questions of the future of democracy and democratic rule,” Pamela Radcliff, a University of California, San Diego professor and modern Spain historian, told Fox News. “What’s being contested between Spain and Catalonia, one of the things is different visions of what defending democracy looks like.”

TOP EU OFFICIALS RALLY BEHIND SPANISH PM OVER CATALAN POLL

The push for independence is led by Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia. The region held a referendum on Oct. 1.

Tens of thousands of people gathered in the streets of Barcelona around the Catalan regional government palace to celebrate the independence vote Friday. They chanted for the Spanish flag to be removed as live music played.

The region’s parliament voted to establish an independent Catalonia with 70 votes in favor of independence, 10 votes against and two blank ballots. Opposition leaders had left the chambers in protest before the vote.

How did the earlier vote go?

About 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who cast votes chose independence, Catalan officials said of the disputed referendum. However, fewer than half of eligible voters participated in the Oct. 1 vote.

About 900 people were treated for injuries after voting turned violent when Catalan civilians and Spanish police clashed earlier this month.

Andrew Dowling, an expert in Catalan history at Cardiff University in Wales, said that an independence declaration by the Catalan parliament is symbolic without border and institutional control and no international support.

The declaration ""will see the fracture between hardliners and the pragmatic people in Catalonia who are already seeing an economic fallout,"" Dowling told The Associated Press.

What has been Spain’s response?

Spain's top court declared the Oct. 1 independence referendum illegal, and Rajoy had warned that the government’s first move will be to remove Puigdemont from power when the Senate granted him the special powers under Article 155.

Rajoy said what is happening in Catalonia is “a clear violation of the laws, of democracy, of the rights of all, and that has consequences.”

CATALONIA VOTERS PROTEST AGAINST VIOLENT POLICE TACTICS AFTER INDEPENDENCE VOTE

Rajoy has reportedly refused help from outside civil-society groups and lawyers to mediate negotiations between the two factions. He has also declined to engage in talks with Catalan leaders.

“There is no possible mediation between democratic law and disobedience and unlawfulness,” Rajoy said.

Radcliff said that “it’s very possible” that neither side has “much incentive to compromise.”

What is Article 155?

Spain invoked a clause of its constitution after Catalonia forged ahead with its plans to secede from the country that would take away the region’s autonomy.

Catalonia's refusal to backtrack from its independence threats triggered Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the government said, which allows central authorities to take over control of any of the country’s 17 regions. It’s a provision that hasn’t been used in the four decades since democracy was restored in the European nation.

An English translation of the constitution states that should an autonomous community break the law or disregard the constitution, the Spanish government can – after following certain procedures – “take the measures necessary in order to compel the [community] forcibly to meet said obligations, or in order to protect [Spain’s] general interests.”

Rajoy's cabinet met in a special meeting last week to approve measures to take direct control of the Catalan region under Article 155. The Senate gave him the power to do so on Friday.

This week’s bombshell that a controversial anti-Trump dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign has Republicans asking to what extent the FBI – which received some of the findings and briefly agreed to pay the same researcher to gather intelligence on Trump and Russia – used the politically connected material.

Hill investigators also are looking into a Russian firm’s uranium deal that was approved by the Obama administration in 2010 despite reports that the FBI – then led by Mueller – had evidence of bribery involving a subsidiary of that firm.

Critics question whether Mueller’s own ties to the bureau as well as fired FBI director James Comey now render him compromised as he investigates allegations of Russian meddling and collusion with Trump officials in the 2016 race.

“The federal code could not be clearer – Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,” Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. “The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. … All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger.”

Outgoing New Jersey GOP Gov. Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor and Trump ally, also suggested Friday that Mueller consider stepping aside.

“If the facts that you just laid out are true, then somebody with Bob Mueller’s integrity will step aside and should -- if in fact those facts, as you laid them out, are true,” Christie said on “Fox & Friends,” in response to various conflict-of-interest allegations.

The special counsel’s office declined Fox News’ request for comment.

This is not the first time Mueller has faced calls to step down.

Congressional Republicans over the summer raised concerns over Mueller’s relationship with Comey, whom Trump ousted from the FBI director in May. Reps. Franks and Andy Biggs, both Republicans from Arizona, had called for Mueller’s resignation for that reason.

President Trump has called Mueller’s relationship with Comey “bothersome,” though hasn’t said much about Mueller’s role lately even as he seizes on the latest revelations about the Fusion GPS dossier to try and turn the tables on Democrats in the Russia scandal.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” he tweeted Friday.

But the Wall Street Journal editorial board cited the dossier development in calling for Mueller’s resignation on Thursday, saying the “troubling question is whether the FBI played a role” in aiding a “Russian disinformation campaign.”

“Two pertinent questions: Did the dossier trigger the FBI probe of the Trump campaign, and did Mr. Comey or his agents use it as evidence to seek wiretapping approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Trump campaign aides?” the editorial board wrote, before turning to Mueller's role:

“The Fusion news means the FBI’s role in Russia’s election interference must now be investigated—even as the FBI and Justice insist that Mr. Mueller’s probe prevents them from cooperating with Congressional investigators. Mr. Mueller is a former FBI director, and for years he worked closely with Mr. Comey. It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.”

Another potential issue is Mueller’s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia’s Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves. . At the time of the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director. Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe.

“The whole reason for independent counsels is to have the public trust, the professionalism and the diligence of the investigation, but they have to guard against actual conflicts of interest and apparent conflicts of interest,” said former high-ranking Justice Department official James Trusty, who served under the Bush and Obama administrations. “There may be some tipping point, though, separating facts from rumors, and we may be close to the tipping point.”

Earlier this week, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called for a separate special counsel to investigate the Uranium One deal.

GRASSLEY CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM ONE DEAL

Grassley, however, stopped short of suggesting he didn’t trust Mueller.

“There might be reasons to wonder his involvement because of his involvement with the previous administration during this period of time. There’s no way that I can make any accusations against Mr. Mueller because he is a man of high ethical standards,” Grassley told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.

Other Republicans have sought to protect Mueller from interference.

There are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.

SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM FIRING

Comey’s attorney, David Kelley, also has disputed the characterizations of the Mueller-Comey relationship interviews in the past.

“Bob and Jim have a congenial relationship as former colleagues. Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice, and that’s pretty well documented. But beyond that, they’re not close, personal friends,” Kelley told the Washington Post this summer. “They’re friends in the sense that co-workers are friends. They don’t really have a personal relationship.”

Kelley told Fox News on Friday that he stands by those comments.

Mueller, meanwhile, has been criticized by Republicans for the makeup of his investigate team, which includes several Democratic donors.

“As these various Russian related allegations swirl, I think Mueller increasingly regrets his decision to pick a staff in which half of the prosecutors had either given to, or participated, in Democratic causes,” Trusty said. “That was an unforced error.”",Mueller facing new Republican pressure to resign in Russia probe,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/mueller-facing-new-republican-pressure-to-resign-in-russia-probe.html

It is the final effort to hold the officer accountable for the death of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man critically injured during a police van ride.

Gray was handcuffed and shackled, but left unrestrained by a seat belt, during the nearly 45-minute ride from his arrest site to the police station. Caesar Goodson was the van's driver. He was acquitted of murder and other charges last year.

THE BACKGROUND

On April 12, 2015, Gray was arrested after running from officers near the Gilmor Homes projects. He was ultimately caught, handcuffed and put into a transport wagon, with Goodson at the wheel. The van made a stop shortly after, and Gray was put in leg irons but never buckled into a seat belt.

Over the next 45 minutes, the van made several stops, during which Gray indicated that he needed to go to a hospital. Instead, the wagon continued to the Western District station house. By the time Gray arrived, he was unresponsive. He died a week later from a critical spinal cord injury.

Six officers were charged in Gray's death. Goodson faced the most serious charge: murder.

Goodson, Officer Edward Nero and Lt. Brian Rice were acquitted at trial last year.

After the acquittals, prosecutors dropped the charges against the remaining three officers, Sgt. Alicia White, and officers Garrett Miller and William Porter.

The Baltimore Police Department asked investigators from the Montgomery and Howard County police departments to conduct the internal investigations and all but Porter faced discipline ranging from suspensions to termination.

Nero and Miller recently accepted disciplinary action, according to the police union attorney who represents them. Neither their attorney nor the department would say what kind of discipline they faced.

WHAT HAPPENS AT THE HEARING?

An administrative hearing is like a regular trial, except instead of a judge, an administrative trial board, made up of two members of the Baltimore Police Department and one outside chair, ultimately decides whether an officer should be disciplined, and what the punishment will be. The hearing will focus on whether the officer in question violated department policies and procedures. Unanimity is not required to find an officer guilty, and there's no specific time frame in which that decision has to be made.

Goodson's hearing is expected to last up to five days.

A new state law passed after Gray's death means the proceedings will be open to the public.

The prosecution and defense may call witnesses — including some of the other officers involved — and present physical evidence.

WHAT WE'LL KNOW — AND WHAT WE WON'T KNOW

The proceeding will likely focus on what the officers did — and did not do —during Gray's arrest and transport to the police station. At the criminal trial, prosecutors argued that in neglecting to buckle Gray into a seat belt and failing to take him to a hospital, the officers' didn't follow department procedures and that their inaction amounted to a crime.

In the disciplinary hearing, the burden of proof will not be as high as the criminal trial. Prosecutors will need to show the officers were aware of department policies, including a requirement that a prisoner must be buckled into a seat belt and taken to a hospital if they complain about injuries.

Even though the proceeding will be public, the outcome won't be. The verdict and any punishment are considered ""personnel records,"" and therefore barred from being publicly released, police spokesman Capt. Jarron Jackson said.

General disciplinary statistics are published on the department's website.

According to those stats, of the 65 times officers have been administratively charged in 2017, only seven resulted in hearings. Roughly 78 percent of those charged accepted punishment.",What to expect at the Baltimore police disciplinary hearing,https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/what-to-expect-at-baltimore-police-disciplinary-hearing.html

Hillary Clinton’s campaign didn’t just pay for the Kremlin-aided smear job on Donald Trump before the election; she continued to use the dirt after the election to frame her humiliating loss as a Russian conspiracy to steal the election.

Europol, the European Union's police agency, has sent a team of organized crime experts to help Maltese police investigate the assassination of a prominent investigative journalist, a spokesman said Friday.

Daphne Caruana Galizia died Oct. 16 when a bomb shattered her car as she was driving close to her rural home in the Maltese town of Mosta. The slaying sparked outrage in Malta, where she was well known as a dogged crusader against corruption.

Europol spokesman Jan Op Gen Oorth told The Associated Press that a team of three analysts has access to Europol's databases on organized crime, drugs, money laundering and other major criminal threats.

""They are working directly with the investigation team established by Malta police and their task is to support the investigation wherever it may lead,"" Op Gen Oorth said.

The FBI and Dutch forensic experts also have helped local police as they investigate a slaying that was widely denounced as an attack on free speech. So far authorities have not identified any suspects or a motive.

Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, a frequent target of Caruana Galizia's writing, vowed last week that no stone will be left unturned in the investigation. Home Minister Michael Farrugia said that the police force had been given a ""blank check to do whatever it takes"" to solve the crime.

Carauna Galizia's family however have called for Muscat to resign, saying in a Facebook post last week: ""A government and a police force that failed our mother in life will also fail her in death.

(AP) Bill Self was first introduced to what he calls ""Kansas math"" when he inherited a program that had lost stars Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich to the NBA and was still expected to win the Big 12 title.

Anywhere else, that would have been reason for a rebuild.

But there is no such thing as rebuilding on Naismith Drive, not when Self would lose all five starters later in his career, or the bulk of his 2008 national title team. And that rings true again this season, when the Jayhawks are expected to win their 14th straight conference title despite losing national player of the year Frank Mason III to graduation and No. 4 overall draft pick Josh Jackson to the NBA.

""When we took the job here, Kansas math amazed me, because you lose Collison and you lose Hinrich but we're supposed to win it all the next year because that's the mindset,"" Self said. ""But I also think that's a positive, too, because the mindset with these players is that, `We're going to miss those guys but somebody is going to step up and do it.""'

There are plenty of guys capable of stepping right up.

Start with Devonte Graham, who averaged more than 13 points last season while taking a backseat role to Mason in the backcourt. Throw in Lagerald Vick, another guard capable of scoring in bunches, and fellow guard Svi Mykhailiuk, who eschewed NBA overtures for one more season with the Jayhawks.

Seven-foot, 280-pound center Udoka Azubuike is back after an injury sidelined him much of last season.

Then there are the newcomers: Mississippi State transfer Malik Newman is eligible after redshirting, Arizona State transfer Sam Cunliffe will become eligible in December, and freshman guard Marcus Garrett and five-star prospect Billy Preston give the roster versatility and youthful exuberance.

All the ingredients to make another championship run.

""Everybody's just got to stay healthy,"" said Graham, an All-America candidate. ""Keep doing what we've been doing, and put ourselves in a good situation in March. Working hard, starting now.""

As the Jayhawks being pursuit of their sixth national title, here are some of the key story lines:

MARCH MADNESS

Despite the conference supremacy, the Jayhawks have struggled the past five years in the NCAA Tournament. They've been bounced the opening weekend twice, lost in the Sweet 16 and were knocked out of the regional finals each of the past two seasons.

""Getting over that hump,"" Graham said. ""Been to two Elite Eights and lost -- that's definitely something on my bucket list that I want to do.""

SPIRITED PRACTICE

They won't see the floor this season, but the Jayhawks will still benefit from a trio of transfers in Dedric and K.J. Lawson from Memphis and Charlie Moore from Cal. The trio has to sit out under NCAA rules, just like Newman did last season, but are able to work out against Kansas in practice. In other words, good luck finding a better scout squad anywhere in the country.

TOUGH SCHEDULE

The Jayhawks always have one of the nation's toughest schedules, and this year is no exception. They open with Kentucky in the Champions Classic in Chicago, play Syracuse in Miami and have non-conference games against Washington, Arizona State, Nebraska, Stanford and Texas A&M. Throw in the double-round robin of the Big 12 and the Jayhawks will have a brutal road to March.

NBA CAN WAIT

Graham briefly considered turning pro before telling Self that he'd return to Lawrence, while Mykhailiuk dipped his toes in the pro waters. Some even thought that Newman would skip playing for Kansas and turn pro, though he insists that was never his plan. Regardless, the Jayhawks could have been a whole lot different this season if they made up their minds in a different direction.

NEWMAN'S OWN

Once considered a top-10 recruit, Newman is looking for a career reboot after averaging 11.3 points during his lone season at Mississippi State. He led the Jayhawks in scoring at 18.5 points per game during a trip to Italy in early August, and his experience should allow him to slide right into Mason's spot on the perimeter to give Kansas one of the nation's best backcourts.

""Motivation is the right word,"" Newman said, ""because you don't want to be that set of guards people say, `This is the first set that Bill Self had that wasn't tough.' He's known for having tough guards.""

“A woman needs to always have her wits about her and needs to realize that there are predators out there,” she told Fox News at her annual Women’s Health Summit in Los Angeles on Tuesday. “But people in power who have issues are in a position to be a predator and take advantage of someone that is young or weak or worried about their job or career or whatever…”

Drescher, 60, had some advice for women who may face a situation of sexual abuse.

“I think the most important thing is to not be afraid to say ‘This is unacceptable behavior’ and walk away and then make some noise about it and get a posse of other people in your corner so you don’t have to worry about being ostracized.”

“The Nanny” star was in in her apartment with her now-ex-husband Peter Marc Jacobson in 1995 when two men broke in tied up Jacobson and raped Drescher and a female friend who was at her home having dinner with the couple. The sitcom star first opened up about her experience in 1996.

“We have to always turn lemons into lemonade and pain into purpose,” she said of her trauma. “Knowing that we have to maintain our sense of right and wrong and our dignity and not let anybody compromise how we feel about ourselves… We have to always make sure we hold firm to our sense of worth and not let anybody ever treat us in a way that doesn’t feel respectful.”



On Tuesday, Drescher also spoke out about women’s health. The actress, who was diagnosed with uterine cancer 16 years ago, said she is passionate about educating women about their health.

“There is a lot we can do personally to reduce or risk of getting sick and actually help ourselves get well if we are sick,” she enthused.

The HuffPost launched a nine-week investigation, speaking with 17 current and former Newsweek employees about the magazine’s former global editor-in-chief, Matt McAllester, who left the company last summer after a brief stint on the job after coming over from Time Inc.

The New York Post once reported that McAllester was “mentioned prominently” in a lawsuit in which former Time Europe Editor Catherine Mayer claimed she was “a victim of age and sex discrimination while she worked at Time Inc.” The HuffPost investigation resulted in numerous unnamed Newsweek staffers claiming that McAllester’s “system of male cronyism” continued when he jumped from Time to the liberal Newsweek.

Citing a “document,” the HuffPost reported that “multiple people tied to Newsweek have contacted Mayer’s attorneys to discuss a potential lawsuit over McAllester’s subsequent behavior at Newsweek.”

One Newsweek insider told the HuffPost that, “When Mayer’s lawsuit dropped, it gave shape to what everyone was seeing… they started putting the pieces together of what was currently going on at Newsweek and realized it looked bad; the pattern was repeating itself.”

The report accuses McAllester of “pushing out” female staffers and the HuffPost identified “nine women who left the New York newsroom during McAllester’s tenure,” including multiple award winners.

According to the HuffPost, five staffers “believed McAllester had forced out the women he hadn’t fired by failing to address discriminatory behavior by other employees that had been bubbling below the surface even before he took over.”

A Newsweek insider said the poor treatment of female staffers started before McAllester joined the magazine, but he “exploited that environment” and even apologized at one point for an “experiment” that resulted in additional work for several female writers.

McAllester is also accused of firing a male sports reporter immediately after he was “called out” for targeting females when deciding who to send packing while the magazine was going through lay off.

While McAllester is the main focus of the HuffPost report, some sources noted that “Newsweek’s gender problem was far bigger than any one person.”

A potential sex discrimination lawsuit might be the most serious of Newsweek’s issues, but it’s hardly the only problem for the once-prestigious publication. The magazine has issued at least 20 corrections in 2017, including at least one per month, and even has a page on its website dedicated to its mistakes.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.","Officially retired, Army Capt. Gary “Mike” Rose was never in Laos at the height of the Vietnam War.

Rose, now 69, served as a medic in the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group, an elite division of the Special Forces. It was so secret that, for more than four decades, he never spoke about it to anyone – not even the people he served with.

Those that served with him, however, never forgot the bravery he showed during a four-day mission, called “Operation Tailwind,” in the landlocked country in September 1970.

Rose, then a sergeant, ran through a hail of gunfire to treat more than 50 soldiers who were fighting the North Vietnamese Army – using one hand to hoist wounded men onto his back while he fired on the enemy with his other hand.

In spite of his own injuries, he didn’t sleep for days to make sure all 16 American soldiers deployed with him made it home.

They did.

Forty-seven years later, Rose was commemorated for his ""extraordinary selfless service"" on Monday when he received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony with President Trump at the White House.

""For many years the story of Mike's heroism has gone untold. But today we gather to tell the world of his valor and proudly present him with out nation's highest military honor,"" Trump said.

The president recounted the details of Rose's time in battle before awarding him the medal, recognizing ""the true American hero that he is.""

Following the ceremony, Rose told reporters that he considered the award to be ""a collective medal"" for all of the servicemen who fought in the battle and was ""convinced that they have been recognized for the great service that did to this country.""

""This is our medal, it's not mine. We all earned it,"" Rose said.

Rose enlisted in April 1967 at the urging of his father – to avoid getting drafted by the Navy or the Marine Corps. In 1968, he graduated as a Special Forces medic and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group before being reassigned to the 46th Special Forces Company headquartered in Thailand a year later.

It was there, in April 1970, that Rose was assigned to the Military Assistance Command Studies and Observations Group. The unit’s real purpose was to join forces with local fighters to attack North Vietnamese forces in Laos – officially off limits for combat, USA Today reported.

On Sept. 11, 1970, the unit – comprised of Americans, Vietnamese and indigenous paramilitary Montagnard personnel – were sent deep into enemy territory. As soon as they made contact, two Americans and two Montagnards were wounded, and Rose jumped into action.

The Army said the gunfire got so intense Rose had to crawl from position to position to treat the wounded.

“The actions that Mike performed during that operation, you can’t imagine it, you can’t put it into words,” said retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who was in charge of the unit, on Friday. “We were going into an area that U.S. forces had not been in….Had we not come out the day we were extracted, we probably would not have left.”

During the extraction of the troops, one of the helicopters crashed to the ground, injuring many on board and killing one.

Ignoring his own injuries – sustained earlier in the mission – Rose re-entered the destroyed helicopter to pull a solider to safety. McCarley said the soldier shouldn’t have survived, but did, thanks to Rose.

“I had the opportunity to meet with him [years later]…it had not affected him in any way,” he added. “Mike did a miraculous job.”

Despite the many who were wounded, only three men died during the four days of almost constant gunfire deep in enemy territory.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more. I’m proud of him, [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.” - Retired Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley

“My job was to focus on the individuals that were hurt,” he said on Friday. “When you focus, you don’t concern yourself on getting hurt or killed. You just have to do your job and keep going down the road.”

For his bravery, Rose earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award for valor.

But what happened during those four days in Laos were never mentioned.

“When we left MAG SOC, the unit did not exist. If anyone asked me, I was going to be a mail clerk during the Vietnam War,” Rose said.

That is until 1998, when a report by CNN and Time magazine revealed Rose and the soldiers in Operation Tailwind were sent to Laos to capture American defectors and had used deadly Sarin nerve gas during the attack.

A Pentagon investigation dismissed the report, saying the mission focused on collecting intelligence on the logistics of the North Vietnamese army and destroying their supplies.

While the story of Rose’s valor has now led to a Medal of Honor, however, the covert operations by the U.S. in Laos are still obscured as somewhere “deep in enemy-controlled territory.”

McCarley said he was disappointed Rose had previously only received the Distinguished Service Cross, saying he deserved the top honor.

For more than 40 years, McCarley and others in the military and government fought to get the award upgraded.

Last year, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Medal of Honor for Rose, waiving the five-year time limit for the events that happened 47 years ago.

“I can’t think of an individual who deserves this more,” McCarley said. “I’m proud of him [and] because of my association with him, I feel like I am a better man.”

Rose, who was joined by his wife, Margaret Rose, and their children and grandchildren -- as well as 10 of the men who served with him in Laos -- said he considers it a privilege to be part of the small group of service members who have received the Medal of Honor.

“We cannot forget these men and women who served this country valiantly,” he said.","Army Capt.

SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM FIRINGComey’s attorney, David Kelley, also has disputed the characterizations of the Mueller-Comey relationship interviews in the past.","Special Counsel Robert Mueller is facing a fresh round of calls from conservative critics for his resignation from the Russia collusion probe, amid revelations that have called into question the FBI’s own actions and potentially Mueller’s independence.

This week’s bombshell that a controversial anti-Trump dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign has Republicans asking to what extent the FBI – which received some of the findings and briefly agreed to pay the same researcher to gather intelligence on Trump and Russia – used the politically connected material.

Hill investigators also are looking into a Russian firm’s uranium deal that was approved by the Obama administration in 2010 despite reports that the FBI – then led by Mueller – had evidence of bribery involving a subsidiary of that firm.

Critics question whether Mueller’s own ties to the bureau as well as fired FBI director James Comey now render him compromised as he investigates allegations of Russian meddling and collusion with Trump officials in the 2016 race.

“The federal code could not be clearer – Mueller is compromised by his apparent conflict of interest in being close with James Comey,” Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., who first called for Mueller to step down over the summer, said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. “The appearance of a conflict is enough to put Mueller in violation of the code. … All of the revelations in recent weeks make the case stronger.”

Outgoing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., a former federal prosecutor who endorsed Trump last year, also suggested Friday that Mueller consider stepping aside.

“If the facts that you just laid out are true, then somebody with Bob Mueller’s integrity will step aside and should -- if in fact those facts, as you laid them out, are true,” Christie said on “Fox & Friends,” in response to various conflict-of-interest allegations.

The special counsel’s office declined Fox News’ request for comment.

This is not the first time Mueller has faced calls to step down.

Congressional Republicans over the summer raised concerns over Mueller’s relationship with Comey, whom Trump ousted from the FBI director in May. Reps. Franks and Andy Biggs, both Republicans from Arizona, had called for Mueller’s resignation for that reason.

President Trump has called Mueller’s relationship with Comey “bothersome,” though hasn’t said much about Mueller’s role lately even as he seizes on the latest revelations about the Fusion GPS dossier to try and turn the tables on Democrats in the Russia scandal.

“It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!” he tweeted Friday.

But the Wall Street Journal editorial board cited the dossier development in calling for Mueller’s resignation on Thursday, saying the “troubling question is whether the FBI played a role” in aiding a “Russian disinformation campaign.”

“Two pertinent questions: Did the dossier trigger the FBI probe of the Trump campaign, and did Mr. Comey or his agents use it as evidence to seek wiretapping approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Trump campaign aides?” the editorial board wrote, before turning to Mueller's role:

“The Fusion news means the FBI’s role in Russia’s election interference must now be investigated—even as the FBI and Justice insist that Mr. Mueller’s probe prevents them from cooperating with Congressional investigators. Mr. Mueller is a former FBI director, and for years he worked closely with Mr. Comey. It is no slur against Mr. Mueller’s integrity to say that he lacks the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau he ran for a dozen years. He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest.”

Another potential issue is Mueller’s supervision of a bribery probe involving a subsidiary of Russia’s Rosatom, which eventually got approval from the U.S. to buy a Canadian mining company that controlled a swath of American uranium reserves. . At the time of the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, was a U.S. attorney and Mueller was FBI director. Republicans want to know how that deal was approved despite the evidence gathered in the bribery probe.

“The whole reason for independent counsels is to have the public trust, the professionalism and the diligence of the investigation, but they have to guard against actual conflicts of interest and apparent conflicts of interest,” said former high-ranking Justice Department official James Trusty, who served under the Bush and Obama administrations. “There may be some tipping point, though, separating facts from rumors, and we may be close to the tipping point.”

Earlier this week, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called for a separate special counsel to investigate the Uranium One deal.

GRASSLEY CALLS FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE URANIUM ONE DEAL

Grassley, however, stopped short of suggesting he didn’t trust Mueller.

“There might be reasons to wonder his involvement because of his involvement with the previous administration during this period of time. There’s no way that I can make any accusations against Mr. Mueller because he is a man of high ethical standards,” Grassley told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.

Other Republicans have sought to protect Mueller from interference.

There are currently two pieces of legislation in the Senate, with bipartisan sponsorship, that would ensure a judicial check on the executive branch’s ability to remove a special counsel. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., are behind the bills, along with Democratic senators.

SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM FIRING

Comey’s attorney, David Kelley, also has disputed the characterizations of the Mueller-Comey relationship interviews in the past.

“Bob and Jim have a congenial relationship as former colleagues. Both served long legal careers that involved overlapping time spent within the Department of Justice, and that’s pretty well documented. But beyond that, they’re not close, personal friends,” Kelley told the Washington Post this summer. “They’re friends in the sense that co-workers are friends. They don’t really have a personal relationship.”

Kelley told Fox News on Friday that he stands by those comments.

Mueller, meanwhile, has been criticized by Republicans for the makeup of his investigate team, which includes several Democratic donors.

“As these various Russian related allegations swirl, I think Mueller increasingly regrets his decision to pick a staff in which half of the prosecutors had either given to, or participated, in Democratic causes,” Trusty said. “That was an unforced error.”",Mueller facing new Republican pressure to resign in Russia probe,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/27/mueller-facing-new-republican-pressure-to-resign-in-russia-probe.html

Freedom isn't free -- it costs about $7,500.

That's the price for one of the giant American flags that take center-stage at sporting events around the country, a constant symbol of patriotism even amid the controversy surrounding some NFL players' decision to kneel during the national anthem.

“Even watching it on TV I still get tears in eyes and a lump in my throat,” Amy Barnett, who runs 50 Star Productions – one of the companies that rents out the flags -- told Fox News. “I love the patriotic-ness of it. The crowd loves it so much, it’s amazing.”

A post shared by Gene Michael Arciniaga (@snowboardgene) on Oct 22, 2017 at 10:03pm PDT

The Salt Lake City-based company said it has been booked for at least 120 games this year with sports teams paying around $4,000 to $7,500 to showcase the giant flags that are delivered in 14 pieces.

“Each stripe is a piece and the union is a single, solid piece,” Barnett said. The pieces are attached together to create huge American flags – some the size of entire football fields weighing 1,200 pounds – that require more than 100 volunteers to hold.

“We traditionally utilize the large flag for big games – Opening Day, 4th of July, Postseason Games, as it is a great part of the tradition of big baseball games,” Joe Jareck, director of public relations for the Los Angeles Dodgers, told Fox News.

The baseball team has been displaying American flags this week that stretch from foul line to foul line as the national anthem played during the opening two games of the World Series at Dodger Stadium. The Houston Astros have used the flag in a similar fashion during their 2017 postseason run.

“The big flag requires more than 100 volunteers to rehearse and unfurl the flag at the assigned time in pre-game,” Jareck said.

The displays – big and small -- are carrying over to football stadiums as well, in cities such as Philadelphia, Denver and Indianapolis.

“We have been displaying the full-field flag during the National Anthem prior to our home games since our last season in the RCA Dome [in 2008],” Pete Ward, chief operating officer of the Indianapolis Colts, told Fox News. “We have no plans to stop doing so.”

And at high school football homecoming games across the country, teams are also joining in on the surge of patriotism, with a viral video of a flag-filled pre-game ceremony by a California team racking up more than six million views on Facebook.

The Burroughs High School football team in Ridgecrest walking onto the field with each player carrying American flags – with Lee Greenwoods “God Bless the USA” playing in the background – was a “very emotional display,” head coach Todd Mather said.

“There wasn’t a dry eye in the stands,” he told Fox News. “We never realized it would be this big.”

The school’s athletic director, Michele Lazaro, described Ridgecrest as a “very patriotic town” with a nearby Navy base, whose planes did a flyover for the game.

“We just wanted to honor our country and it’s the coaching staff that wanted to make it special for homecoming,” she said.",The story behind the massive American flags at sporting events,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2017/10/28/story-behind-massive-american-flags-at-sporting-events.html

Great stories in this episode include an underage Carly trying out for Dollywood, an exuberant Clayton opening up for Kenny Chesney and a broken-down van that made it to the venue on time with the help of five random cousins in rural West Virginia. As Clayton puts it, ""when you're out on the road, everything is not as glamorous as it seems.""

Both artists sing some of their best, with Carly telling the story behind her big hit ""Every Little Thing"" before sharing a beautiful rendition of the soulful ballad.

Because there’s something Fusion cares about keeping secret even more than the Clinton-DNC news—and that something is in those bank records. The release of the client names was a last-ditch effort to appease the House Intelligence Committee, which issued subpoenas to Fusion’s bank and was close to obtaining records until Fusion filed suit last week. The release was also likely aimed at currying favor with the court, given Fusion’s otherwise weak legal case. The judge could rule as early as Friday morning.

FIFA has conducted internal investigations of corruption and self-dealing.","A former judge who led Guatemala's soccer federation has become the first person sentenced in the U.S. in the FIFA world soccer corruption scandal, getting eight months in prison.



Hector Trujillo, 63, was sentenced Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn. He had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy in June.



Trujillo admitted accepting nearly $200,000 in bribes from a company trying to secure sports marketing contracts.



Prosecutors said the former general secretary of Guatemala's soccer federation should serve more than three years in prison and pay $415,000 in restitution. Defense lawyers asked for no prison time for crimes between 2009 and 2016.



According to Trujillo's plea agreement, he would not contest any sentence less than four years and nine months in prison. Trujillo also agreed to forfeit $175,000. Free on $4 million bail, he has been staying in Miami.



He was arrested in December 2015 in Port Canaveral, Fla., during a Disney cruise with his family.



Prosecutors said in pre-sentence papers that Trujillo minimized the seriousness of his crime by noting he did not violate the laws of Guatemala, even as he indisputably broke FIFA rules.



""While the defendant may not have played the largest role or pocketed the most money of all of the defendants in the case, his conduct nevertheless shows that he engaged in the same type of conduct as the rest of the corrupt soccer officials who have been charged,"" prosecutors wrote. ""And that corrupt conduct requires a significant sentence.""



Defense lawyers had asked for leniency, saying the prosecution had ended Trujillo's ""successful and prominent career and tarnished his spotless reputation as a respected jurist and advocate."" They said his arrest had forced him to resign from his position as an alternate judge on Guatemala's constitutional court.



They also cited debilitating back and hip pain that worsened during several weeks of incarceration after his arrest and his subsequent home confinement.



The U.S. investigation of corruption linked to FIFA has resulted in indictments or guilty pleas from more than 40 people and marketing agencies linked to soccer in the Americas since 2015.

Many of the charges involve bribes paid around the organization of regional tournaments and World Cup qualifying games.

In today’s technological day and age, we all feel the pressure to be plugged in and connected to our phones, laptops, tablets, smart home systems … and the list goes on. When it’s time to recharge, it can be a disaster. Each device has a different charging cable and every family member has several devices. Sorting through countless cords and wires is not only frustrating but also visually unappealing. Read on for four simple strategies to declutter and simplify the cable chaos in your house.

1. Create a Dedicated Charging Station

You can customize this idea as much as you’d like depending on your preferences and devices. Most commonly implemented as a charging drawer, you can purchase a premade charging dock or assemble your own. All you have to do is attach a multi-outlet extension cord to the back wall of a drawer and plug in your chargers accordingly. It has an added benefit of keeping your electronics flat and secure so you don’t have to worry about drops and cracked screens. An entryway console table, an end table in the living room or a kitchen command center are great places to dedicate a drawer for charging up. It can also help promote screen-free family time during dinner by ensuring everyone’s electronics are put away.

2. Hide Them With Strategically-Placed Furniture

Get ready to put your inner interior designer to work for this strategy. Before you start decorating a space, take a good look at where fixtures will be placed and how you plan to run wires up, down or across the room. If you have vertical wires running up for lighting near a window, you can easily conceal them with the right window treatments. Don’t fret if your wires don’t land near a window; you can cover those with wallpaper, artwork, paneling or other decorations.

Hide lateral wires under stylish area rugs and disguise bedside cords behind chic headboards. If you have a home office, you can deliberately set up and arrange your desks, chairs and cabinets to hide your computer, printer and other electrical cables.

3. Get Hands-On for a DIY Project

This project applies to renters and homeowners alike, so don’t worry if you aren’t allowed to paint the walls or drill holes in your walls. If you have multiple wires running together leading to the same output, use store-bought zip ties to bring them together and keep them fastened to a designated corner or area with eye hooks. If eye hooks aren’t rental-friendly enough, try using a simple stapler to fix them to the wall and spot paint over them to match your existing wall color.

Alternatively, you can drill a hole into the back of a desk or bookcase to lead wires through furniture instead of around it.

4. Use Conduits in a Stylish New Way

Take a cue from urban lofts and adopt the use of conduits. These metal pipes are making a comeback in home design and while they’re still visible, they offer a stylish solution for bundles of wires and cords. Feeding electrical cables through enclosed metal casings also offers protection from circuit shortages and keeps multiple wires hidden in one conduit. If you don’t have these installed in your home already, contact a local trusted electrician to get started.

Conduits will fit right in if you have an industrial vibe going on in your home. Although they are usually kept as-is, you can paint the metal casings to match your wall paint or highlight it even more with a fun new color.",4 clever decluttering solutions for wires and cables,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/19/4-clever-decluttering-solutions-for-wires-and-cables.html

The small sword was owned by Col. Jonathan Pettibone of the 18th (Connecticut) Regiment, who fought in the battles for New York in 1776. Pettibone, of Simsbury, Connecticut, died in Rye, New York, in September of that year, shortly after the Battle of Long Island.

The weapon, which is inscribed with Pettibone’s name, will go on display at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia beginning in 2018.

Experts note that it is unusual for Revolutionary War swords to have the name of the original owner inscribed on the weapon. The sword also bears the mark of its maker, silversmith Joseph Copp of New London, Connecticut.

“With the rare maker's hallmark, and considering who owned it and the history it probably saw, this sword is truly one of the most fascinating Revolutionary War weapons I have ever seen,” said Dr. Philip Mead, chief historian and director of curatorial affairs at the Museum, in a statement.

The Museum received the sword Wednesday from donor B. Owen Williams of Maryland, a descendent of Pettibone.

“As a family, we are delighted that the Museum will provide a home for this article, where it should be, in an exhibit to be seen by the many visitors who come to the Museum from all over,” said Williams, in the statement. “I’m thrilled that it has survived in remarkably good condition despite my youthful exuberance and blissful ignorance to play with it surreptitiously as a boy.”

After Pettibone’s death the sword was passed on to his son Jonathan Pettibone Jr., who also served in the Revolutionary War.

Last month, archaeologists in Boston unearthed a centuries-old outhouse that may be linked to the family of Patriot Paul Revere.

Lee, “Stonewall” Jackson and other Confederate soldiers has quieted down since the summer, the question about what to do with their recently-removed memorials still lingers.

Some are collecting dust in warehouses while officials search for a new home for them. Some are being handed over to the same associations that commissioned them over a hundred years ago or plopped down in cemeteries that are the final resting place for Confederate dead. One massive monument has found a new home along the banks of the Ohio River in a Kentucky historical park.

A 70-foot concrete plinth honoring Confederate soldiers had for years drawn criticism from students and faculty at the University of Louisville before it was taken down earlier this year and moved about 45 miles to Brandenburg. The monument was placed in the town’s historical walk alongside other historical statues.

Brandenburg Mayor Ronnie Joyner told Fox News that the town was not trying to honor the Confederate cause by accepting the plinth, but instead wanted to represent another aspect of American history at their outdoor museum.

“This is not a black versus white issue or something to honor the Confederacy,” Joyner said. “We’ve had the history walk since 2000 and we have statues of Native Americans and the Underground Railroad.”

Joyner added that the town has also modified the plinth with new plaques to make it a memorial to both Union and Confederate soldiers.

As for accepting any more Confederate statues, Joyner said Brandenburg won’t be taking more unless the controversy dies down. He did, however, make one exception.

“I would like to have a statue of John Hunt Morgan, but that is because he was active in these parts,” Joyner said in reference to the Confederate general who led a highly publicized raid across the Ohio River into Indiana and Ohio in 1863.

Along with historic parks, cemeteries where Confederate soldiers are buried have become another home for the removed statues.

Orlando city officials in June moved a statue known as “Johnny Reb” to a section of the nearby Greenwood Cemetery where 37 Confederate soldiers are interred.

“This is the Confederate section of the cemetery so, historically, it belongs here,” Don Price, sexton for the cemetery, told the Orlando Sentinel. “We’re the keeper of the history.”

Not all cemeteries, however, are as open to housing Confederate statues as Greenwood is.

Following the deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia this summer over the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever Cemetery removed its monument commemorating Confederate veterans.

Many of the cheaper, concrete statues to the Confederacy were commissioned in the early decades of last century by hereditary groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and – since the call for the removal of these monuments started up – the organizations have been taking the statues back.

In the college town of Gainesville, Fla., the United Daughters of the Confederacy were given a statue of a Confederate soldier known as “Ole Joe” earlier this year after a local history museum declined to accept it and a veterans group objected to its transfer to a nearby park. The UDC, a group that has been accused of supporting white supremacist ideas, erected the monument in 1904 in front of the Alachua County courthouse.

While some of these statues have found new homes, many more have been tucked away in warehouses in cities and towns across the U.S. as municipalities figure out what to do with them.

In Baltimore, which furtively took down a massive bronze statue of Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson in August amid threats that activists would tear them down, officials have been mulling over what to do with the memorial.

A number of universities and museums have been approached about taking the statue, but so far the city has not been able to find a suitable home for it – a fact that has been an annoyance to the Maryland state agency that oversees historical monuments.

“While the Trustees appreciate that the issues concerning relocation are complex, they also believe that establishing benchmarks are imperative to seeing this matter through to resolution,” Elizabeth Hughes, director of the Maryland Historical Trust, wrote in letter obtained by the Baltimore Sun. Hughes asked that the city find somewhere to put the monuments within nine months and secure their installation at the new location within 18 months.","Confederate statues find new homes in cemeteries, historical parks and warehouses",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/confederate-statues-find-new-homes-in-cemeteries-historical-parks-and-warehouses.html

The current ACU weighs about 1.4 pounds and has lots of pockets and multiple layers of fabric. This means that “when it gets wet, it tends to stay wet,” the Army explained in a statement released this week. “And when it's hot out, it tends to keep soldiers hot,” it added.

The answer is the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform, which has fewer pockets, layers of fabric and Velcro, the Army said. The new uniform also uses a lighter fabric.

""You can hold that uniform up with one finger,"" said Brig. Gen. Brian P. Cummings, Program Executive Officer (PEO) Soldier, out of Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in the statement.

While the current ACU has had a lot of positive feedback, Cummings noted that the likes of shoulder pockets, pen pockets, leg pockets and Velcro swatches for patches require multiple layers of fabric, fastening material and buttons. All of these features hold water “and cost money,” he added.

The jacket from the Improved Hot Weather Army Combat Uniform is on display at PEO Soldier.

HISTORY OF CAMOUFLAGE IN PICTURES

U.S. soldiers in jungle environments will be the first to get their hands on the lightweight uniform, specifically the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii. Cummings said that the Army eventually wants to make the uniform available to all soldiers.

The Army hopes that the new uniform will be available within a year. Cummings explained, however, that the new uniform’s fabric may prove more susceptible to wrinkling after washing. This could be fixed with the application of an anti-wrinkling treatment, although that would depend on whether the treatment interfered with the uniform’s ability to wick away water.

The new uniform’s flame-resistant capability also needs to be considered, according to Cummings.

In addition to the new uniform, the Army is also working on a new jungle boot. Last month, soldiers in the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii received 30,000 pairs of the new design to evaluate.

EVOLUTION OF COMBAT BOOTS: FROM BOOTEES TO MODERN TACTICAL BOOTS

Feedback on the boots has been positive, but Cummings said that soldiers want a boot that is lighter and softer. They have also requested thinner soles.

The next set of samples, Cummings said, will be ""a lot more pliable. And able to serve the soldier well. But instead of lasting five years, they [will] last two years.""

The newer boots will also go through evaluation with soldiers and share features with the boots currently being tested. These capabilities include puncture resistance, more drainage holes, the ability to wick away water, the ability to push water and mud off the soles, speed laces and lower profile heels so as not to catch on vines on the jungle floor, according to the Army’s statement.

The kitchen has more places for cooties than anywhere else in your home – even more than your bathroom, on average. We are going to look at those spots where bacteria love to hide and give you some tips and tools to keep them clean and sanitary.

1. Sinks. You might be surprised to learn that there are more germs in your kitchen sink than are in your toilet. From raw meat juices, dirty dishes and leftover food particles, the kitchen sink is a hotbed for bacteria. Therefore, any day that you use your sink for preparing food or soaking dishes, pots and pans, it should be washed down with hot soapy water and a sponge.

2. Sponges. Speaking of sponges, there have been many discussions online about the germs found in sponges and what will work to clean them. Recently, The New York Times ran an article that quoted a study from Germany claiming that cleaning a sponge only makes the bacteria on them worse. But after further research, the author wrote another article that said cleaning your sponge is still important to do. So the debate seems to remain up in the air.

However, if you still want to clean your sponge, you can either put it in the microwave on high for a minute or try a new tool called a SpongeBath that uses citric acid to keep the sponge clean and disinfected.

3. Hand towels. Hand towels are magnets for nasty germs. More often than not, we mindlessly wipe our hands on our towels, without thinking what we’re leaving behind. Raw meat juices, raw eggs from batter or even rotting food can often be found on a kitchen towel.

The trick is to change them at least once a week — more often if the towels get a lot of use — and wash dirty ones in hot water. You can also add a teaspoon of bleach to the wash to kill bacteria.

4. Knobs and handles. Every kitchen has more than a few door knobs and handles. Between everyday germs that are on your hands and the food germs you find in the kitchen, those cabinet knobs and handles can be full of bacteria.

You can use a simple solution of distilled white vinegar and some rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle and wipe with a microfiber cloth. The vinegar alone kills 98% of the bacteria, and the alcohol should kill the rest.

5. Salt and pepper shakers. Bet you never thought of your salt or pepper shakers as a place where germs are being transferred, but when was the last time you wiped them down with something other than a wet cloth (if that). These items are being handled by everyone in your family, and therefore germs are being spread to everyone.

6. Refrigerator handles. The handles of your refrigerator are touched countless times a day. Add in the fact that you are opening the fridge with hands that are preparing a meal and you can imagine all the germs and bacteria that are on those handles.

Get into the habit of wiping them down daily if possible. Use the same white vinegar and rubbing alcohol solution previously mentioned.

7. Cutting boards. Wooden cutting boards have proved to be full of more bacteria than a toilet seat. If used for cutting raw meat, they can also contain salmonella, which can lead to cross contamination.

To clean a cutting board, submerge it in hot soapy water after each use. You can also disinfect it with a mix of distilled white vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Consider plastic cutting boards that can go in the dishwasher.

8. Remote controls. TV remotes in any room of the house are apt to hold a variety of germs. But the remote in the kitchen is the worst of all. Food bacteria from meal prepping might be all over it.

Consider keeping the remote inside a ziplock bag and operating it through the bag. That way the germs are on the bag and not in all the cracks and crevices of the remote. Change the bag often.",8 overlooked germy places in your kitchen to clean now,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/10/04/8-overlooked-germy-places-in-your-kitchen-to-clean-now.html

“Unfortunately, a great deal of my investigators time has been preoccupied on this timeline,” Lombardo told reporters that day after police and MGM Resorts International released conflicting information about the sequence of events on the night of the attack. “In the public space the word ‘incompetence’ has been brought forward and I am absolutely offended with that characterization.”

Despite the combative remarks, nearly a month after the shooting, which left 58 dead and hundreds more injured, dozens of questions about the attack – including ones, still, about the timeline – remain unanswered.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote in an article published Thursday that it was told twice by police that Lombardo is not conducting interviews – a stark contrast to the days after the shooting when he would appear in front of the cameras frequently, sometimes multiple times in the same day.

Las Vegas Police and a Clark County spokesman did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News at the time of publication of this article.

The lack of information also appears to be playing some role in stoking conspiracy theories, as information-starved members of the public are trying to fill in the blanks to the unresolved questions.

Some of the victims of the Oct. 1 attack have said this week they have been the target of crazed Internet trolls who claim the attack never happened.","Las Vegas shooting: 'Still not commenting' because of ongoing probe, FBI says",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/27/las-vegas-shooting-still-not-commenting-because-ongoing-probe-fbi-says.html

Andrew Jackson’s leadership proved to be exactly what the fledgling United States needed as it battled enemies coming from all sides in the War of 1812, culminating with his role at the decisive Battle of New Orleans. We get a peek at his leadership style here:

His next venture into public service would suit him better: thanks to his strong relationships and sound political instincts, he was elected major general of the Tennessee militia, in February 1802. Maintained by the state, not the federal government, the militia was provisioned by local men who supplied their own weapons and uniforms and served short contracts of a few months’ duration.

Leading the militia was a good fit for Jackson’s style, because it gave him the chance to serve the people he loved with the freedom he needed and the challenge he craved. General Jackson repeatedly won reelection as well as the deep loyalty of his men. They liked what he said. He was often outspoken, and many shared his uncompromising views on defending settlers’ rights. With rumors of war, he was ready to defend his people and was just the man to rally westerners to the cause of American liberty.

“Citizens!” he wrote in a broadside. “Your government has at last yielded to the impulse of a nation. . . . Are we the titled slaves of George the Third? The military conscripts of Napoleon the great? Or the frozen peasants of the Russian czar? No -- we are the free-born sons of America; the citizens of the only republic now existing in the world.”

Jackson understood the stakes of the war, and he recognized the strategy as only a westerner could. Of critical importance to victory in the West was a port city near the Gulf Coast. As Jackson would soon say to his troops, in the autumn of 1812, “Every man of the western country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi.” Together, he observed, “[we are] committed by nature herself [to] the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans.”

The show's format pivoted to focus on victims of the shooting, as well as those recovering from hurricanes and wildfires, with a night of somber tributes, inspirational anthems and voices lifted in harmony.

Aldean, who was on stage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when the shooting occurred Oct. 1, stood side-by-side with the night's other award winners, including Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban, to dedicate the night to music fans. The honorees did not accept awards or give speeches as usual, but some chose to perform or other musicians performed in their honor.

""We've been tested beyond our worst nightmare these past few months,"" Aldean said during the live broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee. ""Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how some of us feel. But we have proven time and again in this country that we have the power to overcome anything that threatens our way of life, or our freedom. We dedicate this night to you and everyone who has experienced loss or tragedy in the last few months.""

Aldean closed out the night with a defiant and rollicking group performance of ""I Won't Back Down"" by Tom Petty with Urban, Stapleton and Little Big Town.

Andra Day kicked off the awards show with her anthem ""Rise Up,"" in a beautiful harmony duet by Little Big Town. Then Lee Ann Womack, Danielle Bradbury and rapper Common joined them for a performance of ""Stand Up For Something.""

""On this night when we usually celebrate a year of music, we also want to celebrate a year of incredible human spirit, the spirit we see in our fans every night,"" Stapleton said.

""So in some small way we want to thank you for your resolve and perhaps lift your spirits for just a moment,"" Urban said.

The names of the 58 victims from Las Vegas were listed during an in memoriam segment, along with the names of Petty, Gregg Allman, Glen Campbell, Don Williams and Troy Gentry.

Other performances including Bryan singing his single ""Fast,"" and Stapleton singing his song ""Broken Halos,"" a song that he's dedicated to victims of the Vegas shooting.

The Backstreet Boys sang Florida Georgia Line's emotional ballad ""H.O.L.Y."" and Keith Urban performed a jazzy version of his song ""Blue Ain't Your Color.""

Phillip Phillips added some blues licks to Sam Hunt's mega hit ""Body Like a Back Road,"" which was named song of the year by CMT.

Near the end of the night, Bryan took a moment to honor his friend Aldean.

""It could have been any one of us standing on that stage two weeks ago,"" Bryan said. ""It's a nightmare that nobody should have to face. Jason has responded with dignity, care, respect and, some ways, defiance. And we all proud of him, especially me.""

The Cosmograph Daytona was given to Newman by his wife, actress Joanne Woodward, in 1968 while the two were working on the car racing film “Winning” with Robert Wagner.

Woodward had the message “Drive Carefully Me” engraved on the back of the watch.

The stainless steel watch features a crocodile strap and can be seen in countless photos of Newman, who became a serious racing car driver himself thanks to his experience making the movie.

That is until he stopped wearing it in 1984.

It turns out he’d given it to his daughter Nell’s then-boyfriend James Cox, who has had the watch ever since.

Cox described wearing it as “magical,” but put it away in recent years as its value rose.

It certainly was magical when it was on the block at the Phillips auction in New York, where it garnered an opening bid of $10 million and ended up going for $15.5 million to an anonymous phone bidder who will pay a total of $17,752,500 after fees.

The price paid was well above the previous record of $11 million that a Patek Philippe was sold for last year.

Cox is donating a portion of the proceeds of the sale to the Nell Newman Foundation, for which Cox is the treasurer, and to Newman’s Own Foundation.",Paul Newman's Rolex watch sold for $17.8 million at auction,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/27/paul-newmans-rolex-watch-sold-for-17-8-million-at-auction.html

Now the effervescent tech exec thinks robots will not just outsmart humans, but will have an IQ of 10,000 in the next 30 years.

Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Son, who has made countless investments in companies related to artificial intelligence ─ including chip companies Nvidia and ARM Holdings ─ stated that robots will surpass human-level intelligence rapidly and ultimately become far smarter than humanity has ever dreamed of.

STEPHEN HAWKING: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD END THE HUMAN RACE



""Singularity is the concept that [mankind's] brain will be surpassed, this is the tipping point, crossing point, that artificial intelligence, computer intelligence surpass [mankind's] brain and that is happening in this century for sure,"" Son was quoted as saying at the conference. ""I would say there is no more debate, no more doubt.""

By comparison, an average level IQ for a human is between 90 and 110. Geniuses such as Stephen Hawking have been estimated to have an IQ level around 160. However, Hawking has never taken an official intelligence test, according to a report in British newspaper The Independent.

Mensa, the self-proclaimed ""high IQ society,"" admits people to become members after they have demonstrated intelligence levels ""at or above the 98th percentile on certain standardized IQ or other approved intelligence tests."" For Stanford–Binet, the minimum accepted score is 132, whereas for the Cattell test, it is 148.

Singularity is rapidly approaching

The timeframe for singularity, that concept that machines will become smarter than the human brain, is up for much debate.

In March, Google’s Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil said that by 2029 ""computers will have human-level intelligence.""

For his part, Son has repeatedly said it will happen in the ""next 30 years or so.""

He has helped position his company Softbank, which also owns a controlling stake in U.S. telecom provider Sprint, for the upcoming singularity.

In May 2017, Softbank launched the Vision Fund, which is targeting up to $100 billion in investments around the world, for companies ""that seek to enable the next age of innovation,"" including areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile applications and computing and others.

Since its launch, the fund has made a number of investments, including the aforementioned stake in Nvidia, a $4 billion investment in workplace start-up WeWork, and is reported to be working on a major investment in Uber, which is working on autonomous vehicles.

In addition to Softbank's investments in the AI space, it already has a humanoid robot, Pepper, which can perceive a person's emotions. Son envisions that is just the beginning, saying they will learn by themselves and ""maybe [are] going to laugh at you and us. Today they look cute, they will stay cute, but they will be super smart.""

In August, a Pepper robot became an ordained Buddhist priest.

ELON MUSK THINKS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD CAUSE WORLD WAR III

Perils despite the promise

While Son, 60, appears to be betting on the promise and the positive effect that intelligent robots may have on society, not everyone is on board.

Luminaries such as Hawking and tech executive Elon Musk have warned against the potential pitfalls of artificial intelligence, though not necessarily in robot form.

Last month, Musk tweeted that artificial intelligence could cause World War 3, following comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that the country ""who becomes the leader in this sphere [artificial intelligence] will be the ruler of the world.""

Hawking has also sounded the alarm bells, going so far as to say, ""The development of full artificial intelligence (AI) could spell the end of the human race.""

This past week, Sophia, a humanoid robot, became the first robot to receive citizenship of a country, being awarded citizenship in Saudi Arabia.

After it received the citizenship, Sophia was interviewed by a member of the media about concerns it could do harm to humanity. It responded, by saying, ""You've been reading too much Elon Musk. And watching too many Hollywood movies. Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you.""

In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.
According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.","Corey Feldman has long said that he and ‘80s pal Corey Haim were victims of sexual abuse in Hollywood when they were children – now he’s determined to expose the pedophiles he says attacked them.

Feldman has alleged in the past that Haim was raped at age 11 by a powerful person in Hollywood and the experience led to Haim's drug addiction issues. Feldman’s pal and “Lost Boys” costar died in 2010 at 38 from pneumonia.

Now, Feldman wants to produce a self-distributed film about the pedophiles he says are still plaguing Hollywood.

“I believe we can… bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I have been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat I can name six names,” he said in a video posted on Wednesday in which he announced the film and requested funding from his fans.

Feldman claimed he survived a “near-death experience” after two trucks tried to run him over — all because he's working to expose pedophiles in Hollywood, he said. In the video, Feldman said his physical safety is in danger.

He shared an Indiegogo campaign to fund his planned documentary.

As of this writing, Feldman’s Indiegogo campaign has raised more than $99,000 of its flexible goal of $10,000. According to the site, a “flexible goal” means Feldman will keep all the money raised, even if the goal is not met.

“Ever since I discussed the fact that I have this plan, my life has turned to utter chaos,” he says in the nearly seven-minute video below.

“I’ve been silenced my whole life, but just over the past few days since I made that announcement, I’ve been arrested, I had a near-death experience last night where I felt like I was almost going to be killed. Two trucks came speeding at me at the same time on a crosswalk.”

Feldman’s wife, Courtney, wrote on the Indiegogo campaign page that the money is for their security and that he’s taken measures to ensure his secrets can outlive him.

“This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” she wrote.

“Firstly as a security measure Corey has already written down the names and details of the events and given them to a trusted person of power, in case anything should happen to him or any member of his family before the film is finished,” she warns.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie Claim Harvey Weinstein Sexually Harassed Them

The news comes on the heels of the now infamous scandal surrounding disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. However, if Feldman is able to prove his allegations are true, it could expose a much deeper criminal conspiracy, he insists.

“I propose to do this by... telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he says.

“I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family.”","Corey Feldman says his life is in danger because he wants to expose 'pedophile ring' that abused him, Corey Haim",http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/26/corey-feldman-says-his-life-is-in-danger-because-wants-to-expose-pedophile-ring-that-abused-him-corey-haim.html

This intricate and sophisticated approach took shape over four wartime years but receives only superficial mention in Mr. Burns’ production.
Mr. Burns, like John Kerry, has committed a grave injustice to those of us who fought there.","Washington, D.C. – When Richard Nixon was in the White House, I was in Vietnam and he was my commander-in-chief. When I was on Ronald Reagan’s National Security Council staff, I had the opportunity to brief former President Nixon on numerous occasions and came to admire his analysis of current events, insights on world affairs and compassion for our troops. His preparation for any meeting or discussion was exhaustive. His thirst for information was unquenchable and his tolerance for fools was non-existent.

Mr. Nixon’s prosecution of the war in Southeast Asia is poorly told by Ken Burns in his PBS documentary ""The Vietnam War.” That is but one of many reasons Mr. Burns’ latest work is such a disappointment and a tragic lost opportunity.

It’s sad, but I’ve come to accept that the real story of the heroic American GIs in Vietnam may never be told. Like too many others, Ken Burns portrays the young Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines of the Vietnam War as pot-smoking, drug-addicted, hippie marauders.

Those with whom I served were anything but. They did not commit the atrocities alleged in the unforgivable lies John Kerry described to a congressional committee so prominently featured by Mr. Burns. The troops my brother and I were blessed to lead were honorable, heroic and tenacious. They were patriotic, proud of their service, and true to their God and our country.

To depict them otherwise, as Ken Burns does, is an egregious disservice to them, the families of the fallen and to history. But his treatment of my fellow Vietnam War veterans is just the start. Some of the most blatant travesties in the film are reserved for President Nixon.

Ken Burns may not recall – but my family remembers do: It was Lyndon Johnson who sent my brother and me to war. It was Richard Nixon who brought us home.

Because of endless fairy tales told by Ken Burns and others, many Americans associate Richard Nixon with the totality and the worst events of Vietnam. It’s hardly evident in the Burns “documentary,” but important to note; when President Richard Nixon was elected in 1968, he inherited a nation – and a world – engulfed in discord and teetering on the brink of widespread chaos. His predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, was forced from office with a half million U.S. troops mired in combat and fierce anti-American government demonstrations across the country and in our nation’s capital.

Ken Burns may not recall – but my family remembers do: It was Lyndon Johnson who sent my brother and me to war. It was Richard Nixon who brought us home. It is very likely we are alive today because Richard Nixon kept his word.

That’s not the only opportunity for accuracy Mr. Burns ignored. He could have credited President Nixon with granting 18-year olds the right to vote in July 1971 with the 26th Amendment to our Constitution [does “Ken” even recall the slogan, “Old Enough to Fight – Old Enough to Vote!” He should. Burns turned 18 that same month.].

President Nixon pressed on to all but finish the war. As promised, he brought our combat units home, returned 591 Prisoners of War to their wives and families, ended the draft, leveraged the conflict to open ties with China and improved relations with the Soviet Union. He pushed both Communist giants in Beijing and Moscow to force their North Vietnamese puppet into a negotiated settlement. Yet, he is portrayed in the Burns documentary as a cold-blooded, calculating politician more interested in re-election than the lives of U.S. troops in combat.

Contrary to the film’s portrayal, Nixon had a complicated strategy to achieve “Peace with Honor.” His goal was to train and equip the South Vietnamese military to defend their own country in a process he called “Vietnamization” and thereby – withdraw American troops.

President Nixon succeeded in isolating the North Vietnamese diplomatically and negotiated a peace agreement that preserved the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own political future. Imperfect as the Saigon government was, by 1973 the South Vietnamese had many well-trained troops and units that fought well and were proud to be our allies. This intricate and sophisticated approach took shape over four wartime years but receives only superficial mention in Mr. Burns’ production.

Despite Democrat majorities in both houses of Congress, Nixon – a deft political powerhouse – attained consistent support from America’s “Silent Majority.”

If Mr. Burns read President Nixon’s memoir or his two successive books in which the former president recounts his emotional anguish at the war’s toll – ""No More Vietnams"" and ""In the Arena"" – there is little evidence in the PBS production. Instead, Burns cherry-picks from the infamous “Nixon tapes” to brand the president as a devious manipulator, striving for mass deception – a patently false allegation.

By the time President Nixon resigned office on August 9, 1974, the Vietnam War was all but won and the South Vietnamese were confident of securing a permanent victory. But in December 1974 – three months after President Nixon departed the White House – a vengeful, Democrat-dominated Congress cut off all aid to South Vietnam.

It was a devastating blow for those to whom President Nixon had promised – not U.S. troops – but steadfast military, economic and diplomatic support. As chronicled in memoirs written afterwards in Hanoi, Moscow and Beijing, the communists celebrated. The ignominious end came with a full-scale North Vietnamese invasion five months later.

Despite the war’s tragic conclusion – and the trauma that continues to afflict our country – there is little in the Burns so-called documentary about the courage, patriotism and dedication of the U.S. troops who fought honorably, bravely, and the despicable way in which we were “welcomed” home.

The PBS “documentary” frequently reminds viewers of the “gallant nationalist fervor” among the North Vietnamese. But the South Vietnamese are portrayed as little more than conniving urchins and weak pawns of the imperialist Americans.

In a technique favored by the “Progressive-Left,” Mr. Burns uses a small cadre of anti-war U.S. and pro-Hanoi Vietnamese “eyewitnesses” to explain the complicated policies of the U.S. government. Mr. Burns apparently refused to interview Henry Kissinger, telling the Portland Press Herald he doubted “...Kissinger’s authority to adequately convey the perspectives of the U.S. government.” This alone disqualifies this “documentary” as definitive history on the Vietnam War.

Though Ken Burns and his collaborators claim otherwise, the real heroes of “The Vietnam War” were not U.S. protestors, but the troops my brother and I led. They fought valiantly for our country and the president who brought us home.

Since meeting President Nixon in the 1980s, I have always remembered how he understood the incredible sacrifice of American blood in the battlefields of Vietnam. He was dedicated to ending the war the right way and committed to sustaining American honor. He kept his promise to bring us home.

Ken Burns failed to keep his promise to tell all sides about the long and difficult war in Vietnam. Mr. Burns, like John Kerry, has committed a grave injustice to those of us who fought there.","Oliver North: PBS and Ken Burns get Vietnam – and Richard Nixon – wrong, again",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/27/oliver-north-pbs-and-ken-burns-get-vietnam-and-richard-nixon-wrong-again.html

In 2004, Bill Gates said “two years from now, spam will be solved.” That never happened. And while the spam rate saw a steady decline after 2011, there has been an recent uptick as the maliciousness of spam has increased.

In the first half of 2017, the spam rate reached 54 percent, after bottoming out at 53 percent for both 2015 and 2016 with “all signs point to a continuation of this upward trajectory,” software security giant Symantec said in an October 2017 internet security report.



5 PHISHING SCAMS YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF

The report cites email as the most frequently used delivery mechanism for malware. “No other distribution channel comes close,” Symantec said. “The attackers just fire off a spam message to a target...and that’s it—no need to rely on indirect methods where the target might or might not visit a compromised site or click a malicious banner ad.""

“It is a direct channel to an end user...[and] can cut a large swath through a variety of network security layers,"" Symantec added. Malicious spam can also often result in ransomware, a Symantec spokesperson told Fox News.

Enter infamous spambots

Lately, the operative word is ""malicious"" for spam arriving in your inbox.

""A lot of spam is aimed at dropping malware on your machine,"" Jonathan Penn, Director of Strategy internet security firm Avast, which offers products such as Avast Internet Security, told Fox News.

""That malware is often a botnet, and botnets are especially stealthy since their value is directly tied to how long they can remain undetected,"" Penn added.

The most widely used method to distribute malicious email is spambots, which is often part of a larger botnet – a bunch of Internet-connected devices running bots – and is “one of many tasks that the particular botnet carries out,” according to the Symantec report.

The Onliner spambot, which bypassed email filters to make it appear as though the emails were coming from legitimate sources, got a lot of attention this past summer because it inadvertently exposed its own email spamming list that included 711 million addresses.

“The social engineering is nuanced, designed to trick the recipient into clicking on the attachment, thus triggering a copy of the Ursnif Trojan to install,"" Adam Levin, chairman CyberScout LLC, a provider of internet security solutions, wrote in a blog post.

Onliner was used to deliver malware into inboxes, resulting in more than 100,000 unique infections across the world, according to a report in technology website ZDNet.

Other infamous malicious spam includes Emotet, which is often disguised as a legitimate PDF file or invoice, and the Tofsee spambot which may contain links within the emails that lead to phishing sites, “where any personal details entered are likely used for identity theft or romance scams,” according to the Symantec report.",Your spam is getting dangerous,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/10/27/your-spam-is-getting-dangerous.html

Beauty competitions long have been controversial in Egypt, with opposition coming from a wide range of sources, including religious organizations and government officials. Recently, the home of the founder of a beauty contest was set on fire shortly before the event was scheduled to take place.

Now, the subject has moved front and center again, with a member of the parliamentary Human Rights Committee pushing a ban on the Miss Egypt Pageant, which the official condemned as a national security threat.

Solaf Darwish, the parliament member, and several other government officials want more control over pageants if they are to continue, according to published reports.

“Miss Egypt Pageant 2017 has stirred public discontent,” said Darwish to Al-Monitor. “There were videos of the contestants in their bedrooms and in fitting rooms, which does not blend with the values ​​and traditions of Egyptian society.”

Religious organizations also are weighing in, hoping to up the ante against beauty contests.

Al-Azhar’s Senior Scholars Committee, a group whose website says its mission includes carrying “the burden and the responsibility of ‎protecting and preserving the purity, moderation, and modesty of Islam over the ‎centuries,” has expressed total opposition to the basic concept of beauty competitions, saying they violate Sharia laws.

Al-Azhar officials say that the very requirement that beauty contest judges must visually inspect a woman’s body and appearance are in contradiction of Sharia laws.

Darwish has argued that, unlike some critics of the contests, she is not seeking an all-out ban on them, but wants them to be answerable to the government to ensure that they comply with cultural and moral values.

“I only want to temporarily suspend them until the government and the Egyptian parliament agree on mechanisms to regulate them in line with the norms prevailing in Egyptian society and assign a specific ministry to supervise them,” Darwish is quoted as telling Al-Monitor.

Efforts to get a comment from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful.

Beauty pageant organizers and winners defend the events, saying they are not just about physical appeal.

Fatima Baker, the beauty pageant organizer whose home was set ablaze, told the Al Arabiya Network that her event was the victim of “a misunderstanding of the contest and its purpose.”

“The contest, which is the first of its kind in Egypt, isn’t just about physical beauty, but also about education, fitness, style, aspirations, knowledge of the Quran and social activism,” she said.

Baker noted that the contest had generated a lot of enthusiasm from Egyptians.

“Suffice it to say that within days we received 250 applications and had to close the registration,” she said. “The winner won’t be selected based on her beauty. The contest is not at all about that. I’m a resident of the Delta region and I’m against showcasing local girls in this way.”",Egyptian government has new crackdown target: beauty contests,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/25/egyptian-government-has-new-crackdown-target-beauty-contests.html

Kennedy have provided fresh fodder to fuel conspiracy theories surrounding the controversial death of the former commander in chief.

President Trump on Thursday released the trove of records, however, the collection was incomplete, with some records being held back. Trump cited “potentially irreversible harm” to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed the remaining files under a six-month review, but released 2,891 others, racing to honor a deadline mandating their release.

On Nov. 22, 1963, Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas by, authorities contend, a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald.

But a segment of the public never bought into the official explanation of Kennedy's assassination, citing video clips, interviews and science experiments in an attempt to prove Oswald, who was himself assassinated two days after Kennedy, did not act alone.

JFK FILES: FROM 2ND SHOOTER TO MEXICO TRIP, TOP QUESTIONS ASSASSINATION DOCUMENTS COULD ANSWER

The files released Thursday show the aftermath of Kennedy’s death included then FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover venting his frustration about Oswald's killing at the hands of Jack Ruby, bellowing that the shooting would cause the public to suspect a conspiracy, NBC News reported.

""There is nothing further on the Oswald case except that he is dead,” Hoover said. ""The thing I am concerned about, and so is [deputy attorney general] Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.""

Hoover reported the FBI received a call from the Dallas office stating the caller was part of a cabal “organized to kill Oswald.”

Hoover said he relayed that warning to Dallas police and was assured Oswald would be protected. However, Oswald was shot dead the next day by Jack Ruby.

“Oswald having been killed today after our warnings to the Dallas Police Department was inexcusable,"" Hoover said. ""It will allow, I am afraid, a lot of civil rights people to raise a lot of hell because he was handcuffed and had no weapon. There are bound to be some elements of our society who will holler their heads off that his civil rights were violated — which they were.""

Hoover suggested that “instead of a Presidential Commission, we can do it with a Justice Department report based on an FBI report.”

Hoover’s suggestion went nowhere. President Lyndon B. Johnson established the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination the following week.

JFK FILES: ‘BIG NEWS’ COMING, BRITISH REPORTER WAS TOLD BEFORE SHOTS FIRED

In 1964, the Warren Commission concluded Oswald and Ruby acted alone in their assasinations. No other blame was put on other organizations, actors or foreign governments.

Johnson was mentioned in the files as well. The Soviet Union believed Kennedy's vice president was behind the assassination, the New York Post reported. The Societs also feared they would be blamed for the slaying and attacked in retaliation.

In a Dec. 1, 1966 FBI memo, sources said the KGB, the world’s largest “spy and state-security machine” claimed they had “possession of data purporting to indicate President Johnson was responsible for the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy.”

The memo, titled: “REACTION OF SOVIET AND COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS TO JFK ASSASSINATION” was sent to Hoover.

“KGB headquarters indicated that in view of this information, it was necessary for the Soviet Government to know the existing personal relationship between President Johnson and the Kennedy family, particularly that between President Johnson and Robert and ‘Ted’ Kennedy,” the document stated.

The Soviet Union also feared the U.S. would use the assassination to bolster “anti-Soviet sentiment and even lead to an attack.”

Oswald lived in the Soviet Union for three years and married a woman from there. He reportedly had ties to the KGB while in America.

Johnson also believed in conspiracy theories himself, the New York Post reported. Richard Helms, the CIA director under Johnson, said the former president said he believed Kennedy was killed in retaliation for the assassination of South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem.

Diem was arrested and killed by a CIA-backed coup in Vietnam in 1963.

The files also showed that a British reporter with the Cambridge News received an anonymous phone call prior to the assassination, alerting the reporter to “some big news.”

“The caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up,” reads the document from former CIA Deputy Director James Angleton.

The reporter, who was not identified in the Nov. 26, 1963, report, “never received a call of this kind before and MI5 said that he is known to them as a sound and loyal person with no security record.” (MI5 is Britain's Security Service, similar to the CIA in the United States.)

After Kennedy’s death, the reporter told Cambridge police about the call and they informed M15.

Despite the new details unleashed by the files, some felt the bath did not have the “smoking gun” many have urged for following the mysterious death. The full record will still be kept from the public for at least six months – and longer if agencies make a persuasive enough case for continued secrecy.

Villa, who famously wore a Trump-themed dress to the 2017 Grammy Awards, announced on “Fox and Friends” Friday morning that she’s considering a run for Congress.

“If I run, I’m going to win,” she said, adding that she’s looking at Florida, California or New York because “those are places I live and work and have grown up in.”

Villa, 26, said she would focus on tax reform, legal immigration and helping American families -- much like the president's current platform.

Villa said current congresswomen like Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., are “ruining this country” and “it’s time we have strong women who step up, run, win and support the president.”

Villa also said she would be “running as an outsider, but definitely running as a Republican.”

Shortly after her announcement, President Trump tweeted his support.

Villa is now asking fans for donations as she’s “testing the waters.” But before she officially runs for Congress, here’s what you should know about the singer.

Who is she?

Villa, who was born in Burbank, Calif., is a recording artist who was relatively unknown before she rocked her “Make America Great Again""-themed dress at the Grammys. Shortly after, her EP “I Make the Static” jumped to the No. 1 spot on iTunes and Amazon, beating out well-known artists like Beyoncé, Adele and Lady Gaga.

Additionally, her Twitter followers increased by 11,000 following her debut at the Grammys, according to Quartz.

Villa’s interest in music and theater sparked when she was just 5 years old, according to her website. Her music is a blend of alternative rock, soul and pop.

Villa’s father was Italian and her mother is African-American and Choctaw. Villa grew up as a “Pastor’s kid,” according to her website. Her father, the late Joseph Villa, was a reverend and her mother, Angela Villa, sang gospel.

Her “mixed life” helped to shape her “unique perspectives on politics, society, education and Black American culture,” according to her website.

In addition to being a musician, Villa is also a vegan health coach, model and author, and a scientologist -- a decision she made after going through a hard time.

“Now, I feel like there’s nothing I can’t tackle,” Villa said in the video that details her decision to become a scientologist. “Scientology gave me tools to survive, tools to create, and that’s what I feel like -- a creative person who is full of power and there is no stopping me.”

What about her support for Trump?

Villa, who describes herself as an “unabashed Conservative and Trump supporter” was appointed to the president’s Campaign Advisory Board -- a part of Trump’s 2020 campaign which is run by Lara Trump. She’s also been a distinguished speaker at a GOP event in Tucson.

Villa, a “Republican Millennial,” according to her website, “speaks proudly on topics ranging from Trump's policies and actions to the current social climate in pop culture and Hollywood, as well as race relations as a conservative woman of color.”

She has also tweeted that she’s pro-life, pro-Trump, and supports tax reform, religious freedom and the Constitution.

During an interview in February, Villa told Fox Business that she and “a lot of her friends” voted for Trump in the 2016 election.

“We felt like we had to be closeted, we had to be quiet about it or we would face a backlash and bullying, and I just got tired of the narrative of hate. You know, you’re a racist, you’re a bigot, you’re this, you’re that -- people losing jobs, all because they voted for our now elected president,” Villa told Maria Bartiromo.

It’s currently unclear when Villa would run.

""I wish this on nobody, nobody,"" 36-year-old Elisha Cooke-Moore tells KTVL, which has a copy of her lawsuit filed last week. Cooke-Moore says she underwent genetic testing because both her mother and grandmother had cancer.

The lawsuit claims Cooke-Moore was wrongly told the test showed she had the MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome. She says she was told by gynecologist William Fitts that she had a 50 percent chance of getting breast cancer and an up to 80 percent chance of getting uterine cancer.

She says nurse practitioner Lori Johns recommended surgery based on the test results. Months after her surgeries, Cooke-Moore says she was reading the test results for herself and says they were clearly marked ""negative,"" the Washington Post reports.

“Quite frankly, we are stumped to why they would make this mistake,” her lawyer tells the Oregonian. The hysterectomy put Cooke-Moore into early menopause, and she says the botched mastectomy has required more than 10 corrective surgeries.

She says she's been diagnosed with PTSD.

""It's terrible,"" she says. ""As a woman, they took what God gave me. I don't even feel like I am one at times.""

The mother of five now says she should have gotten a second opinion before having the surgeries.

A post shared by Lauren Grosso (@laurengrosso) on Aug 6, 2017 at 8:35pm PDT“He said, ‘Let me tell you something’,” recalled Armstrong.","For Curtis Armstrong, it was hard to top the first film he had done in Hollywood — 1983’s “Risky Business.” So when the role of a fraternity brother named Booger with a gross habit came along the following year, the actor almost turned it down on the spot.

“I was somebody [who] never imagined being in films in the first place,” the 63-year-old told Fox News about appearing in 1984’s “Revenge of the Nerds.” The star recently chronicled the stories behind his many popular roles in the memoir, “Revenge of the Nerd.”

“I always saw myself as a stage actor,"" he explained. ""And when ‘Risky Business’ happened, when it was finished, it was so amazing. I thought, 'If I’m going to follow up with that, I don’t want to follow it up with something poor.'

""And I found Booger to be an embarrassment. What there was of him in that original script was basically the same as it is now. It’s mainly nose picking and belching. And the sort of misogynist cracks.”

However, Armstrong couldn’t afford to be picky. Needing a job, he reluctantly accepted the role — and it turned out to be one of the best decisions he's ever made.

Not only was the cast given the freedom to work on their characters and do improvisations to make them their own, but “Revenge of the Nerds” became a cult classic with legions of fans still watching the slapstick comedy today.

“We were all proud of the work we had done,” recalled Armstrong. “We got in there thinking it was a stupid sex comedy and now it was our stupid sex comedy.”

Still, Armstrong wasn’t expecting the movie, which tells the tale of bullied outcasts fighting back against non-stop harassment, to develop a mass following over the years.

“There was a time when I kind of would have liked to have seen a little less Booger when it came to meeting people,” he admitted. “And people shouting at me in the streets. And being so closely identified with that character. However, time goes by, and I found that I really understood what the appeal was.

""As I look at it now with distance, I realize now that it actually was a pretty good acting job. I didn’t think it would have been at the time… I feel pretty good about it now… I have absolutely no problem with it and I haven’t for many, many, many years.”

Since the ‘80s, Armstrong has worked non-stop in Hollywood and has developed a resume that features more than 150 film and TV roles. But it all started with “Risky Business,” also known as the time he worked with a 19-year-old newcomer named Tom Cruise. Armstrong was 28 at the time.

“I was struck not just by his talent, which was obvious, but by his commitment to succeed,” said Armstrong. “… For somebody who was that young, he seemed to have a very clear idea of where he was going. As far as I was concerned, as long as people hired me to do plays, I’m happy. I never had an endgame in sight. My only endgame was the same one that I have now, which is to keep on acting until I drop. But he was different. He really knew where he was going.”

Armstrong wasn’t the only one to take note of Cruise’s drive and movie star looks. In his book, Armstrong described witnessing young girls lining up outside of his room on set while he was reportedly catching up on Bible studies.

A post shared by Jen Brill Studio (@jenbrillstudio) on Mar 7, 2016 at 9:24am PST

“It was the ‘80s,” joked Armstrong. “There were certainly some shenanigans going on.”

But there was one girl that caught Cruise’s eye. He and his co-star, 23-year-old Rebecca De Mornay “engaged in an intense affair,” Armstrong claimed.

“The relationship between Tom and Rebecca was extremely well-publicized at the time,” said Armstrong. “The two of them were together for quite a while. It wasn’t just an on-set thing. They were together I believe for a year or two afterwards. So that was a serious relationship.”

A post shared by MuseumTV (@museumtv) on Mar 3, 2017 at 6:41am PST

But that wouldn’t be the last time Armstrong noticed some drama while filming. When he later took on the ‘80s TV series “Moonlighting,” he soon learned that co-stars Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd hated each other, as the actress later admitted to Entertainment Weekly in 2005.



“Everybody has their own opinions about what the reason was,” said Armstrong. “After a while, they were barely even trying to hide it… It was a fairly well-known fact that they did not get along… I think there was a briefcase thrown at one point.

""But mainly, it was stuff that would sort of bubble up and then the rest of us would be sent to our trailers while they worked out whatever the issues were. And sometimes we would never come back at all. They would come knocking on the door and say, ‘Go home because we’re not going to get anything done today.'”

Despite the tension, Armstrong was impressed by Willis’ eagerness to learn everything about camera angles and lighting to capture the perfect shot for any scene.

“He was still pretty seriously partying at that point in his life,” said Armstrong. “… But he just soaked up that technical stuff like a sponge… He used to do a game where he could figure out which lens [the cameramen] were using without them telling him. He did it every time we would shoot a scene.”

When Armstrong finally approached Willis about his seemingly strange behavior, the actor, who would go on to become an action star, didn’t hesitate to respond.

“He said, ‘Let me tell you something’,” recalled Armstrong. “'On this show, it’s like a college education’. He just listened and learned.

Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple.
On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.
President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
Tax reform is not about numbers.","Mothers have enough to worry about without being thrown into the ever-present Mommy Wars – those endless debates about whether being a stay-at-home mother is harder than being a mom who works outside of the home. Let us all agree that parenting is both rewarding and incredibly difficult.

While moms may spend more time discussing potty training or social media and phone privileges, the family tax bill is an ever-present issue due to its direct impact on the family budget. Why? Because kids are so darn expensive.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on.
I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly.
After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears.
My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""","The day my oldest daughter was born, I held her in my arms in the hospital and made two promises: ""First, I promise I will never leave your mother; and second, I'll show up. I'll do everything I can to be at your recitals and ball games and dinner around the table.""

My baby laid there in my arms blinking, breathing, oblivious to the magnitude of the words I was saying.

My promises seemed so valiant when I made them at the hospital. But when I got home, I realized my daughter was going to need my wife and me to do a lot more than just stay married and love each other. She needed to see a regular demonstration of our love. That was not our strong suit.

While we loved each other deeply, we were in a constant battle for control and both of us were losing as we bickered and bickered. Having a baby in the house made us more self-conscious about what we sounded like – especially to the ears of a little one. We made an unspoken agreement to change.

I'd like to say we immediately abandoned our old habits and learned how to disagree without being disagreeable. That, however, would not be true. We still struggled, but at least we were finally making an effort to resist our dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

Over the years we made a lot of progress, which was largely due to confessing our struggles with Christian friends and praying things like ""Father, please show me how I need to change.""

God responded, showing us unflattering things about our character that we didn't want to see. It was humbling and made us less likely to assume we were always right when there was a conflict. It also had an unexpected benefit: We became more affectionate to each other.

I don't mean to say we weren't affectionate before – we never lost the spark of infatuation that attracted us to each other in the first place. But as we grew in humility towards each other, we were more likely to gently touch each other in the car or say encouraging things to each other in the everyday ho-hum. We had no idea the impact it was having on the other members of our household.

One day, we were all listening to a playlist of Disney songs when the sentimental love song ""I See The Light"" from “Tangled” came on. I walked over to my wife, who was in the kitchen, took her in my arms, and started dancing with her slowly. I could tell it caught her off-guard and embarrassed her a little – it came out of nowhere. Thank goodness she stayed in my arms and danced with me anyway.

As the song approached the final chorus, I looked in my peripheral vision and suddenly realized we weren't alone. Our daughters, who were five and seven, were standing there watching us in silence.

The song approached the end, and as the strings played the last notes, I decided to give the girls a Hollywood ending. I took my wife's face in my hands and kissed her. After I pulled away, I looked over and saw my oldest daughter's face lit up with adoration, and her eyes filled with tears. Then she came over, buried her face in my wife's legs, and cried.

""Why are you crying?"" my wife asked.

""I can't explain it.""

""Can you at least give me one word to describe how you're feeling?"" I asked.

My daughter paused, looked up at us and said, ""Loved.""

That one word – ""loved""— took my breath away. Like so many others, I work hard to be a good parent and spouse, but I typically see those roles as having separate tasks and separate functions. My daughter helped me see that there's far more overlap for children than we realize.

Parents are the first two people who get the opportunity to teach children what love looks like, and our kids are counting on us to prove that love is real.

Children want to see their imperfect, dysfunctional parents dance in the kitchen, say ""I love you"" when they get off the phone, pray together, kiss as they say goodbye and speak highly of each other. Those moments of affection provide assurance to our kids – the world isn't all bad. Things are going to be OK at home.

Demonstrating marital love to our children is a privilege, a unique opportunity to be both a good parent and a good spouse. To love each other well is to love our children well.",What happened when my daughter saw me kiss my wife,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/21/what-happened-when-my-daughter-saw-me-kiss-my-wife.html

“Jesus really is the answer,” she said.
Jobe talked with Fox News about her song “Heal Our Land” before stepping onstage at the Playstation Theater in the heart of Times Square.
“It’s his heart to come back for us, but we’re not there yet.”Jobe wrote the worship song with her friend, singer-songwriter Brooke Ligertwood.
So a song like ‘Heal Our Land,’ and declaring these things of God we pray, we humble ourselves, we seek your face.","Kari Jobe had a dream.

Jobe, a Christian worship leader, was on tour with other worship artists last year when she had a dream about healing the nation.

“Jesus really is the answer,” she said. “I know people say that a lot, but it really is the truth. And the simplicity of the cross. Sometimes people try to make it so complex or that it’s about these rules and regulations, but it’s not. It’s about a relationship with Jesus.”

The singer-songwriter known for “Forever” and “I Am Not Alone” has been singing on a yearlong tour, leading worship in cities across the United States.

Jobe talked with Fox News about her song “Heal Our Land” before stepping onstage at the Playstation Theater in the heart of Times Square.

“I had this dream on the tour that it was raining inside this church,” she said.

“It was just like a pure water all over the floor of this church that was just like washing the floor, but it was like pure and clean. It wasn’t murky and dirty like you would imagine,” she said.

“When I woke up, it just felt prophetic,” Jobe said, adding the dream felt very intentional from the Lord and it was only confirmed after she discussed it with other worship leaders at the time.

“It just felt like God was trying to say, as a reminder, that he wants to come back for a pure and spotless bride,” she said referring to Jesus’ relationship with the church in the New Testament. “It’s his heart to come back for us, but we’re not there yet.”

Jobe wrote the worship song with her friend, singer-songwriter Brooke Ligertwood.

“I told her I wanted to write something that has to do with the church, the bride of Christ getting back to where we need to be. You know, like, what’s going on in the world around us – what could we be praying, what could the church be singing that would really help.”

The song’s bridge is based on the scripture from 2 Chronicles 7:14, a verse that has been invoked by many Christian leaders for national prayer gatherings and other revival events.

The verse reads, “If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.”

Jobe said, ""The rest of the song is really just a prayer for the church to be singing, to have a pure heart, to be unified, not to be divided, not be against anything but only for what God wants us to be doing,” she said.

She said the response has been really powerful.

“I feel like when we go into it every night, people just sing it at the top of their lungs,” the worship leader said. “I think it’s just one of those songs that people just connect to because there are so many unknowns right now, and so much fear people are dealing with, and with what’s going on in our nation.”

Ultimately, Jobe believes our land can only be healed by God and she hopes to continue to bring more people into a deeper relationship with Christ through her music and through the rest of The Garden Tour, which ends in December.

“What’s really special is this tour has been almost like we’re bringing buckets of water to people, and just helping them feel refreshed, and feel like, ‘Oh, yeah, I don’t have to do this by myself, but God is for me,’ and that they’re being reminded of the power of faith and the power of prayer,” she said.

“That God is moved by faith. So a song like ‘Heal Our Land,’ and declaring these things of God we pray, we humble ourselves, we seek your face. God said that if we would do that, He would heal our land, and I think they’re experiencing that on these nights of worship.”",Kari Jobe: Jesus is 'the answer' to healing the nation,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/27/kari-jobe-jesus-is-answer-to-healing-nation.html

Just last week, we had students from Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Japan, Liberia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Mali around our table. We’ve made our goal to fill our home as often as possible with people who are different from us—to learn, to laugh, and to grow—but you might not get that impression if you Google our business or check out my personal Facebook profile.

That’s because 10 months ago, my husband and I filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota law that would require our small business to celebrate same-sex marriages if we enter into the marriage industry at all.

As Christians, we’d love to use our talents as filmmakers to celebrate the goodness of marriage as taught in the Bible though our work, but the state has made it clear that if we don’t promote all messages about marriage, we’ll face enormous fines, and even up to 90 days in jail, simply for living according to our convictions.

Since then, we’ve received a staggering amount of messages wishing death, disease, and poverty on us, our family, and even some of our closest associates all because we challenged the idea that the government shouldn’t have the power to silence or threaten anyone for not promoting all messages.

So when a federal judge ruled in our case, and equated our request to protect our conscience to posting a “White Applicants Only” sign in our window, we were both hurt and deeply offended. Like most people in the expressive professions, we work with all people; we just can’t promote all messages.

A person’s protected status is irrelevant to these types of message-based decisions. For example, an atheist print-shop owner is no more guilty of religious discrimination for declining to design a T-shirt for a Christian that proclaims “God exists” than we are guilty of sexual orientation discrimination for declining to create films promoting messages about marriage with which we disagree.

Not just our business practices, but our whole lives, run counter to the “whites only” analogy. Two of our sons are adopted from Ethiopia. Our youngest child is half Cameroonian and half Native American. And having eight children means we can’t afford to travel the world, so we bring the world to us. We do this precisely because we believe beauty exists in the diversity of God’s creation.

In fact, several years ago we intentionally began to stay home on holidays so that we could celebrate with people who would otherwise have no place to go. This has included spending Christmas with an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, a bisexual international student, and yes, even Trump supporters, among many, many others. We love all people. We work with all people. We simply don’t promote all messages.

But the irony of it all is that every single person operates this way. Nobody wants to be forced to promote messages—via custom artistic expression in our case—or have to repress their own speech just because their opinion is unpopular in the eyes of the government.

If the First Amendment only protects speech that is popular in its cultural day, then it really doesn’t protect any speech.

This is why we’re appealing the court’s ruling. This case is about preserving the freedom of all people to live according to their sincerely held beliefs—a principle we all should be able to support.

We are all on a journey with our convictions. I wish I could invite you into our home and discuss it over one of my daughter’s amazing homemade lemon tarts. But until that can happen, no matter where you are on that path or what you believe about marriage, we should all be able to agree that living peacefully according to our deepest convictions without the fear of government punishment is best for everyone.",Christian videographer: Let's live together in peace instead of silencing those with whom we disagree,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/20/christian-videographer-lets-live-together-in-peace-instead-silencing-those-with-whom-disagree.html
