Anxious not to push Caracas any closer to economic and political collapse as debt restructuring talks begin, EU governments held back from targeting any individuals.

The bloc instead left names for a later stage to try to persuade President Nicholas Maduro to calm the situation.

“Everything we do is aimed at seeking dialogue between the government and the opposition to find a democratic and peaceful solution,” Spain’s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters at a meeting with his counterparts where the sanctions decision was made.

Venezuelan opposition leaders said last week they would resume efforts to hold a dialogue with Maduro, even though they say he previously used such talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform.

Over the weekend, Maduro had termed imminent sanctions by the bloc as “stupid.”

On Monday, his government said the “illegal” and “absurd” EU measures were a violation of international norms.

“The European institutions show their lamentable and shameful subordination to the U.S. government,” it added.

Spain has long pushed for sanctions on those close to Maduro, whom Washington accuses of installing a dictatorship and slapped sanctions on in July. But the EU has been divided over whom to target.

The arms embargo adds Venezuela to an EU list that includes North Korea and Syria, where European defense companies can no longer do business and to which the sale of any goods deemed as being used for repression are also banned.

Britain sold 1.4 million pounds ($1.83 million) worth of arms to Venezuela between May 2010 and March 2017, according to The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which lobbies to end arms sales to repressive governments.

“GRADUAL AND FLEXIBLE” SANCTIONS

In a joint statement, all 28 EU ministers said the legal basis for individual travel bans to the EU and the freezing of any Venezuelan assets in the bloc “will be used in a gradual and flexible manner and can be expanded.”

Representatives of Maduro’s government were due to meet investors in Caracas on Monday to discuss renegotiating $60 billion in foreign debt.

Some EU governments want to give former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the EU’s main envoy for Venezuela, another chance to try negotiations despite unsuccessful efforts in 2016.

But in the statement, ministers said regional elections held in Venezuela on Oct. 15 were a turning point that had hardened the bloc’s position, having taken place amid “reported numerous irregularities.”

The results appeared to favor Maduro’s ruling Socialists, while polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. In the end it won only a handful of governorships, according to the pro-government electoral board.

EU ministers will decide whom to target with sanctions at a later stage, but said they would focus on security forces and government ministers and institutions accused of human rights violations and the non-respect of democratic principles or the rule of law.

Experts say individual U.S. sanctions spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on Maduro’s policies and that oil-sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the Venezuelan government to change.","EU readies sanctions on Venezuela, approves arms embargo",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics-eu/eu-readies-sanctions-on-venezuela-approves-arms-embargo-idUKKBN1DD0UZ?il=0

Massive asset buying programs and drastic interest rate cuts have stabilized the world’s economies following the global financial crisis but central bankers are starting to put their big policy guns away.

As they shepherd economies back to full health central bankers will instead need to choose their words carefully to manage expectations about future policy and avoid any damaging overreaction or misinterpretation by markets.

Communication is becoming such a policy focus that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney are meeting in Frankfurt on Tuesday to discuss how central banks should speak.

“Once the asset purchase program is tapered the ECB will have to use its guidance on rates as the main policy instrument,” an ECB Governing Council member, who asked not to be named, said.

Part of the problem now is that central bankers just keep talking. Fed governors talk on an almost daily basis, Kuroda speaks frequently and some of the ECB’s 25 rate-setters appear to live a life of their own, sometimes giving speeches at odds with the European central bank’s main policy lines.

Last Thursday, eight European Central Bank policymakers, including five board members, spoke publicly but there was no major policy glitch that needed addressing specifically and few of the speeches carried any significant policy message.

In the United States, a survey by the Brookings Institute think-tank found that two-thirds of Fed watchers wanted governors to speak less frequently and over half wanted Yellen to speak more instead to streamline and focus the message.

‘UNRELIABLE BOYFRIEND’

Interest rates are expected to stay below historic averages for years, if not a decade, so the scope for actual rate changes has diminished and promises about future policy will play a bigger role in guiding markets, central bankers say.

The Fed estimates that neutral interest rates are 2.75 percent, down from 4.25 percent before the crisis, but current rates are still less then half this despite four rate rises by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) since the end of 2015.

“With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for the FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn, raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation,” Yellen said last month.

The ECB is in an even more precarious position. It may end its 2.55 trillion euro ($3 trillion) asset purchases next year but will still be far from raising interest rates.

That too will leave its “forward guidance” - a pledge to keep rates low until well after the bond buying ends - as the chief tool to guide long-term interest rates.

While central banks have often relied on guidance as a policy tool, communication flops during the post-crisis normalization process have been aplenty.

In 2013, the Fed’s suggestion that asset purchases might be coming to a close caused market mayhem. Analysts say the so-called taper tantrum probably ended up prolonging the U.S. bond buying program.

Draghi’s speech in Sintra this year, which suggested that tighter monetary policy might be on the cards, resulted in such a big market sell-off that the eventual policy change was considered relatively mild.

Carney has also had his run-ins with words as his guidance on the path for interest rates was repeatedly knocked off course by surprises in the economy, prompting one lawmaker to call him an “unreliable boyfriend”.

CREDIBILITY ISSUE

The challenge for central bankers now is to nuance their communication to chart a path for long-term rates in a very low interest rate environment - and also start to explain what a new policy framework would look like if another crisis emerges.

“That comes with a number of challenges that have not been fully addressed,” said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management said. “Forward guidance to me is too short an answer.”

“What’s the new monetary style? Will there be a regime shift to some sort to some sort of nominal GDP (gross domestic product) targeting? Do they want to use the balance sheet as a normal tool?” Ducrozet said.

For now, the Bank of Japan is coming under pressure to start discussing how it will eventually end its prolonged period of ultra-easy monetary policy.

Kuroda has so far rejected that demand, even though he has recently suggested that the Bank of Japan could tweak monetary policy before achieving its inflation target.

The day of reckoning is also coming for the ECB. It has learned from the mistakes of others and kept markets calm by promising low rates until “well past” the end of its asset buying program.

But some investors say this time frame is too vague and needs to be refined.

Indeed, some argue that the ECB’s decision to extend it’s bond buying program by nine months to September 2018 was really designed to push back expectations of a rate rise, given the stimulus won’t be that significant.

“Doesn’t the bank have a credibility issue when a its pledge is not enough?” another ECB Governing Council said.

A fifth woman came forward on Monday with new allegations that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager in Alabama and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore, who has refused to step aside, denied the charges and his campaign said he was the victim of a “witch hunt.”

McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials were considering whether a Republican write-in candidate could be found to challenge Moore in the Dec. 12 special election.

“I think he should step aside,” said McConnell, who had previously said Moore should leave the race if the allegations were true. “I believe the women.”

Republican Senator Susan Collins joined McConnell in calling for Moore to drop out, saying she was not convinced by his denials.

The head of the Senate Republican campaign arm, Senator Cory Gardner, said Moore was unfit to serve in the Senate.

“If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,” Gardner said in a statement.

Moore, a Christian conservative and former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, had been a heavy favorite to win the election against Democrat Doug Jones. He has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.

He said on Twitter that McConnell was the person who should step down.

“He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” Moore said.

MANY SUPPORTERS STEADFAST

The state party and many other Alabama Republicans have not wavered in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive primary victory in September over Luther Strange. Strange, who earned the support of President Donald Trump in the primary, was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.

The growing furor over Moore sets up a confrontation between establishment Republicans and the party’s populist movement, led by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. That could endanger the Republican hold on the Senate seat.

A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s midterm elections, giving Democrats a shot at gaining the three seats they need to recapture control of the U.S. Senate.

It is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot but McConnell told reporters he was “looking at” potential write-in candidates who could mount a successful campaign. Asked if Strange might be a candidate again, he said “We’ll see.”

On Twitter, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said Strange was “an excellent alternative.”

The special election had been a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, was trailing by double digits in some polls.

Moore, who is prone to incendiary comments on social and cultural issues, has survived controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

He threatened to sue the Post over the weekend and said the allegations in its story were a smear campaign by his political opponents. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

The new accusation came at a news conference in New York, where Beverly Young Nelson said Moore had groped her while giving her a ride home from the diner where she worked when she was 16 years old.

“I was terrified. I thought he was going to rape me,” she said.

The new conference was arranged by lawyer Gloria Allred, who has represented women in a number of high-profile sexual misconduct cases. Moore’s campaign said Allred was trying to create a spectacle.

Costs relating to the $13 billion U.S. consumer-credit scorer’s recent massive cyber breach helped knock earnings down 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Revenue also took a big hit. And the likely biggest expenses – including a long list of unquantified legal exposures – are yet to rain down.

The Atlanta-based outfit led by interim Chief Executive Paulino Barros reported $87.5 million of pre-tax expenses in the period related to the hack that affected nearly 150 million U.S. consumers. Some are one-offs, and others won’t be. The company expects up to $75 million in additional expenses this quarter.

That may only be the tip of the iceberg. Equifax is one of a handful of credit-scoring companies that collect people’s data on a massive scale and sell it to lenders, making it almost systemically important. That arguably means the bar for protecting its data is higher than for other corporations. It now faces 240 class-action lawsuits in North America, and investigations by a who’s who of watchdogs, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, and the attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states. Equifax says it cannot yet estimate damages and fines, but there are likely to be some of both.

Although group-wide revenue was up in the third quarter, sales in its biggest division, which handles U.S. consumer-credit reports, fell 3 percent. That was a sharp turnaround from a 7 percent growth pace in the first half considering that the breach was made public only on Sept. 7. To give that result, the unit’s revenue in the last three weeks of the quarter would have had to slump by about a third from what was expected, according to Breakingviews calculations. Executives expect group revenue to decline by 3 to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as customers defer more orders.

Investors have lopped off about a quarter of Equifax’s market capitalization since the breach. That’s consistent with a sustained drop in profit on the scale of the third quarter, but it doesn’t allow for an extended slide in revenue or big legal outlays.

In an interview with Belgian daily Le Soir, Carles Puigdemont was asked if a non-secessionist option was on the table to resolve a crisis triggered when Spain took over control of the region after its parliament declared independence on Oct. 27.

“I‘m ready, and have always been ready, to accept the reality of another relationship with Spain ... It (another solution) is still possible,” Puigdemont said.

“I have, being pro-independence all my life, worked for 30 years to have another way of Catalonia being anchored to Spain,” he added, giving no details of what form such a relationship could take.

He posted a link to the interview, which was published on Monday, on his Twitter feed.

The former president is in self-imposed exile in Belgium after running an independence campaign that prompted authorities in Madrid to fire his cabinet, dissolve the regional parliament and call new elections for December.

Puigdemont, who had previously insisted the independence declaration should form the basis of any political negotiations with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, is under conditional release after an international arrest warrant was served against him.

He and four other former members of the Catalan government with him in Belgium face charges of rebellion and sedition.

‘THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE’

Rajoy has said he was open to talks with Catalan leaders on resolving Spain’s worst political crisis since its return to democracy four decades ago, but only within a legal framework and after the independence drive was dropped as a condition.

In an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt published on Monday, Rajoy said the position of the former Catalan leaders focused on the independence vote and gave little room beyond that for debate.

“Many blame me for not seeking political solutions. But I’ve been in politics for a long time and ... there was no alternative,” Rajoy said, adding that the Catalan crisis was the largest problem he had had to face as prime minister.

He said had tried to reach a compromise with the regional government, but it was impossible. “The government of Catalonia had only one goal - the independence referendum,” he said.

The Spanish government has called regional elections for Dec. 21, and Puigdemont’s PDeCAT has failed to agree on a united ticket with other secessionist party, the ERC, denting the pro-independence camp’s hopes of uniting behind the secessionist cause.

The head of the ERC and former deputy to Puigdemont, Oriol Junqueras, will campaign for his party from a prison cell after being detained with other cabinet members who remained in Spain and pending trial on sedition and rebellion charges.

According to an opinion poll released last week, independence supporters would win the election if they ran on a joint ticket, though probably short of a parliamentary majority.","Non-secessionist solution to Catalan crisis possible, says ex-leader",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia/non-secessionist-solution-to-catalan-crisis-possible-says-ex-leader-idUKKBN1DD1DU

The June 19-25 gathering takes place against the backdrop of surprisingly strong airline traffic driven by economic growth, but a steep drop in the appetite for new planes following robust demand for the latest fuel-efficient models in recent years.

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics.

Banks will also benefit from an expected revival in economic activity likely to drive capital expenditure by companies and hasten lending growth that has hit multi-decade lows, Chief Investment Officer Sankaran Naren said at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit.

“Everything you’re looking at is working positively for the corporate banks in the next two years,” Naren, who manages about $44 billion of assets, said referring to those banks that are more focused on lending to companies and which have been hit harder as large borrowers defaulted.

India’s soured loans hit a record $145 billion at the end of June, with state-run banks accounting for the majority of the bad debt. However, the latest quarterly results show increases in bad loans slowing sharply at many banks.

“The biggest area of earning growth over the next two years is going to be the fact that provisioning peaks this year and slowly comes down,” Naren said, adding he was boosting exposure in the sector.

India last month announced a far higher-than-expected $32 billion plan to recapitalise state lenders to help resolve bad loans and kick-start lending growth, spurring a rally in bank stocks.

Naren - a market veteran with over 23 years of experience - said he is also getting more positive on the information technology and pharmaceutical sectors, which have struggled for several quarters.

India’s information technology sector has grappled with cuts in client spending in United States, the biggest market, while regulatory concerns and pricing pressures have hit drugmakers.

HIGHER OIL PRICES

Naren sees higher oil prices in 2018, which would increase India’s trade deficit and lead to a weaker rupee - in turn benefiting export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharma.

The mutual fund house, part of a joint venture between India’s ICICI Bank and UK’s Prudential Plc, has about 55 percent of its assets invested in debt.

It has brought down the average maturity in one of its key bond funds, Naren said, as a three-year bond rally in India comes to a halt over concerns on inflation, fiscal slippage and hawkish monetary policy.

On the other hand, India’s share markets have hit a string of record highs amid strong retail inflows, despite an elusive earnings recovery and uncertainty stemming from the rollout of a major tax overhaul.

That has stretched valuations in several sectors, raising concerns of a potential correction.

Naren said he is confident an earnings recovery will materialize, but warns retail investors should focus on allocating investments in a wide array of funds to hedge risks.

In the absence of a major market correction since 2011, investors are “getting lulled into believing that equity is a low risk asset class,” Naren said.

“That is our biggest worry right now.”

TOWNSEND, Tennessee, Estados Unidos (Reuters) - Cody Saunders nació en 1992 con insuficiencia renal y un agujero en su corazón.

Cuando murió en su 24 cumpleaños había sufrido 66 cirugías y más de 1.700 rondas de diálisis, dijeron sus padres. Algunos días ocultaba su dolor con selfies optimistas en Facebook. Otros, compartía una realidad insoportable, posando en una cama de hospital con vendajes atados a su pecho lleno de cicatrices.

En su perfil de Facebook, Cody escribió que estaba buscando una novia que le aceptase “tal y como es”. “¿Xk soy feo?”, publicó el día de Navidad de 2015.

Cody vivía con sus padres en una autocaravana vieja en un camping al este de Tennessee. Cuando estuvo lo suficientemente bien, trabajó en una granja con su padre, alimentando al ganado, colocando heno, transportando melaza con una camión de descarga de un granero a otro.

El 2 de agosto de 2016 Cody murió después de sufrir un ataque cardiaco cuando iba camino a casa tras una diálisis. Demasiado pobres para enterrarlo o incinerarlo, los padres de Cody decidieron donar el cuerpo de su hijo a una organización llamada Restore Life USA. La empresa vende cuerpos donados -en su totalidad o por partes- a investigadores, universidades, centros de formación médica y otros.

“No podía permitirme ninguna otra cosa” explicó su padre, Richard.

El mes después de la muerte de Cody, Restore Life vendió parte del cuerpo de joven: su espina dorsal. La transacción tan solo requirió un breve intercambio de correos y 300 dólares, más gastos de envío.

Si Restore Life investigó al comprador, no está claro. Pero si los trabajadores de la empresa hubieran verificado la identidad de su cliente se habrían enterado de que era un periodista de Reuters. La agencia de noticias estaba tratando de determinar la facilidad de comprar partes del cuerpo humano y si esas partes serían útiles para una investigación médica. Además de la columna, Reuters compró más tarde dos cabezas humanas de Restore Life, cada una con un precio de 300 dólares.

Las transacciones demuestran la asombrosa facilidad con la que se pueden comprar y vender partes de un cuerpo humano en Estados Unidos. Ni las ventas ni los envíos violan ninguna ley, dicen los abogados, profesores y funcionarios del gobierno que siguen de cerca el asunto. Aunque es ilegal vender órganos para trasplantes, es perfectamente legal en la mayoría de los estados vender partes del cuerpo que han sido donadas para investigación o educación. Podría decirse que comparar vino a través de internet está más estrictamente controlado, requiriendo por lo general una prueba de mayoría de edad.

Para cumplir con las consideraciones legales, éticas y de seguridad antes de las compras, Reuters consultó con Angela McArthur, quien dirige el programa de donación de cuerpos en la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Minnesota. Tomó la custodia inmediata de la columna y las cabezas para Reuters, inspeccionándolas y almacenándolas en la facultad de medicina.

McArthur dijo que estaba preocupada por la facilidad con que se adquirieron las partes del cuerpo y por el fracaso de Restore Life en realizar las diligencias propias.

“Es como en el salvaje oeste” dijo McArthur. “Cualquiera podría pedir estos ejemplares y recibirlos en su casa para el propósito que quieran”, dijo.

McArthur examinó los restos y la documentación incluida con ellos para determinar el grado de utilidad de las piezas para la investigación médica. Su revisión se basó en los estándares nacionales de seguridad y ética que ella ayudó a redactar para la Asociación Estadounidense de Bancos de Tejidos y la Universidad de Minnesota.

Concluyó que el historial médico que proporcionó Restore Life no era suficiente y que el papeleo que lo acompañaba era chapucero e inadecuado. Por lo tanto, las muestras no cumplían con los estándares para su uso en su universidad, dijo ella.

“No había visto antes algo tan atroz”, dijo McArthur. “Me preocupa el futuro de la donación de cuerpos y la confianza pública en las donaciones cuando tenemos situaciones como estas”, añadió.

“RESPETO Y DIGNIDAD”

Contactado meses después de la compra, el presidente de Restore Life, James Byrd, explicó brevemente su enfoque de negocios.

“Organizaciones como la nuestra son lo que entiendo responsables porque, especialmente nosotros, tenemos contacto directo con la familia donante”, dijo. “Y hay un cierto nivel de respeto y dignidad porque tenemos esa relación personal con ellos”.

Posteriormente, Byrd declinó ser entrevistado o responder a preguntas escritas. Pero escribió por correo una declaración en la que criticaba a Reuters por realizar las compras.

“Es obvio que su equipo de Thomson Reuters no tiene ninguna consideración por aquellos que buscan ayuda de nuestra organización”, escribió “Solo deseáis hacer daño a aquellos que más necesitan ayuda”, dijo.

Byrd añadió que Restore Life hacía un buen trabajo suministrando partes del cuerpo a investigadores que trabajan en la cura del cáncer, demencia u otras enfermedades.

Fuese cual fuese el bien que esperara hacer Restore Life suministrando estas partes de cuerpos, McArthur dijo que la pobre gestión de los restos “fracasó miserablemente” en servir a los investigadores y a los tres donantes: Cody Saunders y el hombre y la mujer no identificados cuyas cabezas Byrd vendió a Reuters.

McArthur dijo que los familiares de los donantes, cuyas intenciones son nobles durante un momento difícil, se merecen algo mejor de este sector.

“La gente piensa que está haciendo lo correcto y busca cumplir los deseos de sus seres queridos”, dijo McArthur, quien anteriormente presidió la comisión de donación de cuerpos y es miembro del consejo director de la Asociación Estadounidense de Anatomistas Clínicos. “Sé que se sentirían explotados al saber que ha sucedido algo así”, dijo.

Thomas Champney, un profesor de anatomía en la Escuela de Medicina Miller de la Universidad de Miami, también expresó su preocupación por la facilidad de las ventas.

“Las partes del cuerpo humano no deberían comprarse y venderse de la misma forma que frigoríficos usados”, dijo.

El NEGOCIADOR

Byrd, de 50 años, ha estado en el negocio de partes del cuerpo durante dos décadas. Oriundo del este de Tennessee, el negociante de cuerpos fue recientemente subcampeón en un concurso de monólogos llamado “The Funniest Person in the Tri-Cities”, la zona que rodea Kingsport, Johnson City y Bristol.

Antes de abrir Restore Life, Byrd dirigió un banco de tejidos sin ánimo de lucro llamado American Donor Services, ubicado cerca de Memphis.

Durante varios años, uno de los principales clientes ortopédicos de American Donor fue una firma tejana filial de una empresa que distribuía injertos óseos fabricados en parte a partir de tejido humano. En 2005, según un testimonio jurado en una demanda civil, American Donor cambió a un nuevo cliente ortopédico principal. El nuevo comprador pagaba hasta 10.000 dólares por donante, proporcionaba una línea de crédito de 200.000 dólares y comenzó a gestionar los asuntos financieros de American Donor.

Byrd abandonó American Donor Services poco tiempo después, trabajó brevemente para un banco de tejidos vasculares y luego fundó Restore Life en 2008. Con sede en Elizabethton, Tennessee, Restore Life obtiene cuerpos principalmente de personas de Tennessee, Virginia y Carolina del Norte. A cambio de las donaciones de cuerpos, Restore Life ofrece recoger los cuerpos, incinerar gratis los restos no utilizados y devolverlos a la familia.

En 2011, Byrd habló públicamente sobre Restore Life en una presentación para responsables de los alrededores del condado de Sullivan. Los responsables de la zona se habían sentido frustrados por el creciente coste para los contribuyentes de incinerar a las personas indigentes. Según una grabación de esa reunión, Byrd explicó que podría ayudar al distrito. También indicó que muchas familias que donaban a Restore Life lo hacían por motivos económicos: se cubrían todos los gastos, incluida la cremación.

“Nos hemos convertido en un servicio para aquellos indigentes y pobres que no pueden permitirse un funeral”, dijo Byrd a los responsables. “Es una solución perfecta para situaciones en las que las familias no tienen los fondos necesarios o para las veces que el distrito tiene que hacerse cargo de los gastos”, añadió.

El acuerdo informal de Restore Life con el condado de Sullivan para llevarse los cuerpos de las personas indigentes continua vigente a día de hoy, dijo un funcionario del distrito. Un par de veces al mes, dicen, el médico forense u otros responsables remiten casos de pobres a Byrd para una posible donación. En la reunión de 2011, el fiscal del distrito Dan Street dijo que no era necesario un acuerdo formal con Byrd porque los responsables simplemente le enviaban a los indigentes, sin que hubiera ningún respaldo implícito.

“La empresa simplemente va a venir y llevarse estos cuerpos”, dijo Street a los responsables. “Solo nos apartamos del camino y les permitimos hacer lo que la empresa privada hace mejor”, añadió.

Desde que nació, Restore Life ha crecido prácticamente cada año, según los registros fiscales disponibles presentados ante el Servicio de Impuestos Internos.

Los informes muestran que los ingresos anuales de Restore Life aumentaron de 49.251 dólares en 2009 a 1,1 millones de dólares en 2016. En 2009, los gastos superaban a los ingresos en 1.277 dólares. El año pasado, los ingresos fueron 187.884 dólares más altos que los gastos. Los registros fiscales indican que los activos netos de la organización benéfica fueron de 354.556 dólares al 31 de agosto del 2016, la última fecha para la que existen registros disponibles.

Byrd vive y trabaja en un pueblo de Tennessee donde la media de ingresos por unidad familiar es de 30.000 dólares.

La organización sin ánimo de lucro le pagó un salario de 113.000 dólares el año pasado, según los registros fiscales.

EL DONANTE

Angie Saunders recuerda que durante su embarazo no hubo señales de problemas en sus revisiones en las pruebas de ultrasonidos. Pero cuando Cody nació en agosto de 1992, llegó con graves problemas.

Fue trasladado del hospital del distrito al Centro Médico de la Universidad de Tennessee en Knoxville, donde permaneció tres meses. Fue diagnosticado con el síndrome de VATERL, que implica muchos defectos de nacimiento.

Además del agujero en el corazón y la insuficiencia de sus riñones, Cody nació sin recto. Durante los dos primeros años de su vida, dijeron los padres, lo alimentaron a través de un tubo gástrico. Cody tenía tantas restricciones en su dieta (sin leche, sin chocolate, sin tomates, sin sal) que concluyó que su comida diaria fueran cereales de fruta secos. De postre daba un par de bocados a una barra de mantequilla.

Cody necesitaba diálisis tres veces a la semana, cuatro horas por sesión. Dadas las necesidades de su hijo, su madre no podía trabajar mucho. Su padre dijo por adelantado a todas las empresas que le contrataban que su hijo era lo primero.

“La mitad de su vida, si no era el hospital, era la diálisis”, dijo Richard. “Pasé por muchos trabajos”. Cuando Cody tenía unos 9 años, dijeron sus padres, recibió un trasplante de riñón que lo cambio completamente. Lo liberó de la diálisis constante. Aprendió a nadar y tuvo más tiempo para el colegio.

“No diría que era un chico normal”, dijo Richard, “pero al menos no teníamos tantas ataduras”.

El nuevo riñón duró poco más de cinco años, y cuando falló, Cody fue trasladado en helicóptero al hospital para un ingreso de un mes, dijeron sus padres. La diálisis empezó de nuevo.

A los 14, Cody ganó un concurso de arte infantil. La organización benéfica, American Kidney Fund, lo llevó a Washington, D.C. En un cuestionario del concurso, enumeró sus cosas favoritas, incluida la clase de gimnasia, colorear y montar en bicicleta. Su actor favorito era Scooby Doo. Sus modelos a seguir: su padre y su madre. Cuando creciese, escribió Cody, esperaba trabajar con su padre.

Cody abandonó el colegio en undécimo grado. Sus padres dijeron que leía como un niño de segundo grado. Trabajaba en granjas con su padre tanto como podía y en invierno vendían leña. Masticaba tabaco y jugaba al billar en un club local. Para proteger sus riñones y su corazón, no bebía alcohol. Pero no siempre seguía los consejos de los médicos. Podía tomar un paquete de 6 refrescos en un día, dijeron sus padres.

En sus últimos años de vida, Cody se volvió triste y solitario. Sus padres lo notaron, al igual que sus amigos en Facebook. Estaba cansado de las píldoras, la diálisis, los hospitales y los constantes recordatorios de lo que podía y no podía hacer, dijeron sus padres.

“Creo que no solo estaba cansado su cuerpo, también su mente había tenido suficiente”, dijo su padre.

“No tenía miedo”, dijo su madre. “Estaba preparado”. El corazón de Cody se detuvo en su cumpleaños, el 2 de agosto de 2016. No mucho después, Restore Life recogió su cuerpo.

ENCARGANDO UNA COLUMNA VERTEBRAL

El 29 de agosto de 2016, el periodista de Reuters Brian Grow envió una solicitud por correo electrónico a Byrd. En esos momento, la agencia de noticias no sabía nada sobre Cody Saunders.

Para contactar con Byrd, el periodista utilizó su nombre real y su cuenta de correo de Thomson Reuters.

“Estamos buscando precios, incluidos los gastos de envío, para adquirir una muestra de espina dorsal para un proyecto de investigación que involucra tejido no trasplantable”, decía el correo. El término “tejido no trasplantable” se refiere a partes del cuerpo, como cabezas y columnas, que no pueden trasplantarse a humanos vivos.

La solicitud del periodista incluía una dirección de entrega en Minneapolis, a pocas millas del laboratorio de anatomía de la Universidad de Minnesota. La consulta concluyó: “Esperamos con interés saber de usted”.

Byrd respondió una hora más tarde. “Gracias por tu correo, no me puedo creer que no hayamos trabajado antes juntos ¿cómo supiste de nuestra organización?”.

“Un contacto del sector nos indicó tu empresa”, respondió Grow.

Byrd preguntó si Grow quería una columna cervical completa: las vértebras y el tejido del cuello, justo debajo del cráneo. Cuando le dijeron que sí, Byrd respondió que el precio sería de 300 dólares más un envío de 150 dólares. Adjuntó rayos X en los que se describía que eran de un hombre de 24 años.

Tres días después, Grow aceptó la oferta.

Byrd respondió: “Gracias nuevamente por permitirnos la oportunidad de trabajar con usted y su organización”. Agregó tres preguntas. Una se refería a la facturación, y otra pedía confirmar que la espina dorsal debería enviarse congelada, no descongelada. La tercera pregunta de Byrd era si la muestra se usaría para “investigación médica o educación médica”.

Además de determinar lo fácil que fue comprar partes del cuerpo, Reuters buscó valorar su calidad y la documentación que los acompañaba. Cuando el periodista respondió simplemente “se va a usar para investigación médica”, Byrd cerró el trato.

McArthur dijo que la compra de Reuters fue legal y ética. Ninguna ley prohíbe estas ventas, dijo, y la agencia de noticias estaba llevando a cabo investigaciones legítimas. Byrd, agregó, no violó ninguna ley al vender las partes del cuerpo. Aún así, dijo, las tres preguntas que hizo en su correo electrónico demostraron que el vendedor se centra en cerrar la venta, en lugar de buscar más detalles sobre las intenciones del comprador.

LLEGA LA COLUMNA

El 27 de septiembre de 2016, un repartidor de FedEx entregó una caja de cartón marrón en la ubicación de Minneapolis donde Reuters había alquilado una dirección postal. Allí, Grow recibió el paquete y se lo dio a un cartero especializado en el transporte de restos humanos. El servicio de mensajería lo llevó directamente a McArthur en la facultad de medicina.

McArthur notó irregularidades de inmediato. Dijo que le parecía extraño que la parte exterior de la caja no hubiera una etiqueta advirtiendo de que había restos humanos en el interior. McArthur encontró un par de documentos de una página en la caja. Uno contenía los resultados de una prueba de serología realizada por una compañía acreditada, que certificaba que el donante estaba libre de enfermedades infecciosas.

La otra página ofrecía un resumen escrito a mano, en términos sencillos, del historial médico del donante.

“Por mi experiencia, esperaba ver más solidez” dijo McArthur, explicando que la mayoría de los comerciantes proporcionaban un historial médico más preciso y detallado. “Es muy superficial”.

Se fijó en que el informe médico no tenía membrete o número de teléfono. McArthur también apuntó inconsistencias en los números de identificación de la muestra que figuraban en la parte superior e inferior de una de las páginas. Notó también una pequeña discrepancia entre los números de identificación escritos en la documentación y una etiqueta adjunta a una bolsa de plástico que cubría la columna.

Un historial médico preciso y legible y un sistema coherente de identificación del donante son información crucial para una investigación médica adecuada, dijo el director de servicios anatómicos de la Universidad de California, Brandi Schmitt. El historial médico ayuda al investigador a explicar variables como enfermedades o traumatismos. Una documentación clara y un etiquetado preciso, dijo, permiten a los investigadores seguir a los ejemplares de manera científica.

Para evitar contratiempos que podrían llevar a la pérdida o mala identificación de partes del cuerpo, dijo Schmitt, la mayoría de los hospitales y escuelas médicas usan sistemas modernos de etiquetado, como discos de metal generados por ordenador o códigos de barras. Cualquier etiqueta debería haberse adjuntado directamente a la columna vertebral, dijo ella, no solo al paquete.

“La identificación errónea es un gran problema, eso seguro”, dijo Schmitt, coordinador de las donaciones de órganos para las escuelas de medicina de la Universidad de California en todo el estado.

Una semana después de que llegara la columna, Byrd respondió a un correo de seguimiento de Grow.

Byrd dijo que las cabezas humanas estaban disponibles por 300 dólares cada una. También ofreció descuentos en unos ejemplares de rodilla y pie para liberar “algo de espacio en el congelador”. Escribió que sus bajos precios de partes del cuerpo reflejan el estado de “caridad pública sin ánimo de lucro” de la compañía, y agregó: “Estamos buscando cubrir nuestros gastos generales”.

LUTO Y CENIZAS

Richard Y Angie Saunders dijeron que querían enterrar a Cody junto con sus familiares en un cementerio cercano. Pero Richard, que tiene dificultades para leer, solo gana unos 900 dólares al mes. Angie, que sufre desde hace mucho ansiedad debilitante, no puede trabajar ni conducir. Un entierro era, sencillamente, muy caro.

Los amigos se ofrecieron a pagar la cremación, que generalmente cuesta al menos 695 dólares en esa zona. Pero los Saunders dijeron que se sentían incómodos aceptando la caridad de personas que conocen, así que donaron el cuerpo de Cody a Restore Life. Richard expresó en aquel entonces su agradecimiento por la incineración gratuita que la empresa prometió.

Las dificultades que afrontó esta familia son frecuentes entre los donantes, dijo Martha Thayer, presidenta del programa de ciencias mortuorias en el Arapahoe Community College en Colorado.

Las familias afligidas son “vulnerables y se les pone en una posición de elegir esto como una opción cuando no tienen dinero” dijo Thayer. “Lo único más triste que una persona que no puede permitirse el lujo de vivir es una persona que no puede permitirse el lujo de morir”, añadió.

En el caso de Cody, un familiar leyó un formulario de consentimiento del donante en voz alta a sus padres antes de firmarlo.

Uno de los párrafos dice: “Autorizo a Restore Life USA a obtener todos los tejidos y órganos necesarios para fines educativos y de investigación. Entiendo que este obsequio será utilizado para fines de investigación científica, docencia u otros propósitos conformes y para su uso en múltiples centros educativos o de investigación con ánimo de lucro y/o organizaciones sin ánimos de lucro que Restore Life USA, a su exclusivo criterio, considere necesario facilitar la donación”.

Los Saunders dijeron que creían que esto significaba que Restore Life simplemente eliminaría muestras de piel pequeñas de Cody para investigación médica, lo cremaría y luego devolvería sus cenizas. El formulario de consentimiento de Restore Life para Cody no revelaba que un cuerpo donado puede ser desmembrado, como lo hacen los formularios de consentimiento de la mayoría de las otras empresas.

Unas semanas después de la donación, un hombre de Restore Life entregó una urna con las cenizas de Cody. Angie no recuerda el nombre de este, pero dijo que era amable.

“Muy agradable y comprensivo” dijo.

Los estragos que ha causado la muerte de Cody en Richard preocupa a Angie. No come más que un par de bocados de lo que sea que ella cocine y normalmente se niega a hablar de su pérdida. Richard dice que Angie no está equivocada, pero ha notado que ha reducido su consumo de cigarrillos a tres paquetes al día en lugar de cinco.

En la oxidada camioneta roja y blanca que solía conducir con su hijo, Richard colocó una gran pegatina en la ventana trasera: “Con cariño en memoria de Cody Saunders”.

“Él era mi amigo. Era mi mejor amigo” dijo Richard. “Me repito a mi mismo que lo superaré, lo superaré”.

En una caja de zapatos dentro de su autocaravana, Angie Saunders guarda cuatro fotografías de Cody. En todas mira directamente a la cámara, con sombras posándose sobre su gorra. También mantiene una urna de plata con las cenizas sobre el salpicadero.

“No pude abrazar a Cody cuando vino al mundo y tampoco pude abrazarle cuando se marchó de él”, dijo, “pero volvió a mí, así que está aquí conmigo”.

DOS EJEMPLARES MÁS

En enero, Restore Life envió un segundo paquete a Reuters a la misma dirección de Minneapolis. Éste contenía dos cabezas humanas: una masculina y una femenina. Como detallará una próxima historia, Reuters compró las cabezas como parte de su investigación sobre un caso en Pensilvania. Allí, se encontró una cabeza humana en una zona boscosa cerca de Pittsburgh hace casi tres años.

Una vez más, el cartero especializado llevó la caja al laboratorio universitario de McArthur, donde se puso la indumentaria especial de protección y lo abrió.

El contenedor de poliestireno dentro de la caja de cartón llegó con dos de los bordes exteriores agrietados, lo que lo hace vulnerable a fugas volviéndolo un potencial peligro sanitario para cualquiera que lo sujete, desde mensajeros hasta investigadores, dijo McArthur. También encontró problemas con la documentación de la cabeza del hombre.

“El espacio donde las muestras de tejido suelen figurar en la lista, generalmente con el cliente, la descripción de la muestra, la identificación de la muestra, el tipo de preservación y la fecha y hora de preservación, está en blanco”, dijo.

Del mismo modo, la documentación para la mujer no estaba elaborada profesionalmente, dijo. McArthur indicó que los documentos eran tan difíciles de leer que le costaba entender la información clave que cualquier investigador requeriría, incluido el historial médico de la persona.

EL DESTINO DE UN HIJO

Como es habitual en la industria de negocios de cuerpos, Restore Life no incluyó los nombres de las personas que donaron las partes del cuerpo que vendió al periodista Grow: solo la edad y la fecha de muerte de cada persona.

Reuters no pudo identificar a las personas a las que pertenecían las cabezas que les fueron enviadas. Pero a los 24 años, Cody Saunders murió tan joven que la agencia de noticias pudo identificarlo después de buscar obituarios en los estados del sur.

Con el permiso y la participación de sus padres, Reuters contrató un laboratorio forense para realizar una prueba de ADN. Confirmó que la columna cervical provenía de Cody.

A finales de agosto, Grow volvió para visitar a Richard y Angie Saunders y contarles lo que Reuters había descubierto: Restore Life había diseccionado el cuerpo de su hijo y vendido parte de su columna vertebral.

Durante unos minutos, los padres de Cody se sentaron en silencio.

Angie se quedó mirando al vació. Richard bajo los ojos al suelo. Entonces Angie habló. “Pensé que solo estaban tomando muestras de piel”, dijo, y comenzó a llorar.

Richard trató de consolarla. “Se acabó, cariño”, dijo.

“Yo no quería más cirugías”, dijo ella.

“En ese momento no tenías otra opción”, Richard le recordó, “pero tienes que mirarlo de esta forma: como tú dijiste siempre, si va a ayudar a alguien más...”

“Lo sé, lo sé”, dijo ella.

La pareja no dijo nada más durante casi medio minuto. Finalmente, Richard se volvió hacia Angie. Esta parte de sus vidas había “terminado”, le dijo.

Si hubieran sabido que Cody sería diseccionado, sus padres no habrían donado su cuerpo. Cody, sentían, ya había soportado demasiadas cirugías durante su corta vida. No querían ni esperaban que nadie lo “cortara” tras su muerte, dijo Richard.

Y, sin embargo, añadió: “no podían permitirse hacer otra cosa, por lo que sintieron que era la mejor opción que tenían”.

Richard preguntó si Restore Life usó otras partes del cuerpo de Cody. El periodista dijo que no sabía. Los comerciantes generalmente no divulgan esa información. Richard dijo que dudaba de que encontrase respuestas en Restore Life. “No los culpo”, dijo. Pero agradeció saber qué pasó con los restos de Cody. “Porque nunca lo habríamos sabido”, dijo.

Angie asintió: “No habríamos tenido ni la más remota idea”.

Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel.

(Reuters) - When Mike Sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern Pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing.

He settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course.

”I think there is a coal comeback,” said the 33-year-old son of a miner.

Despite broad consensus about coal’s bleak future, a years-long effort to diversify the economy of this hard-hit region away from mining is stumbling, with Obama-era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget.

Trump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal Obama-era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants.

“I have a lot of faith in President Trump,” Sylvester said.

But hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission.

Although there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978.

A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.

What many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch-22: Coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. The stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation’s poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity.

Federal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of Appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. They include West Virginia and Kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted.

But in southern Pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign-up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. In southern Virginia’s coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.

“Part of our problem is we still have coal,” said Robbie Matesic, executive director of Greene County’s economic development department.

Out-of-work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in Trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. They say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there’s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward.

In Pennsylvania, Corsa Coal opened a mine in Somerset in June which will create about 70 jobs – one of the first mines to open here in years. And Consol Energy recently expanded its Bailey mine complex in Greene County.

But Consol also announced in January that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. And it has commissioned a recruitment agency, GMS Mines and Repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour - half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. The program Sylvester signed up for was set up by GMS.

The new hiring in Pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry’s main business. Some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of Australia.

Officials for U.S. coal companies operating in the region, including Consol and Corsa, declined requests for comment.

“The coal industry has stabilized, but it’s not going to come back,” said Blair Zimmerman, a 40-year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for Greene County, one of Pennsylvania’s oldest coal regions. “We need to look at the future.”

EMPTY SEATS

The Pennsylvania Department of Labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal POWER program, an initiative of former President Barack Obama to help retrain workers in coal-dependent areas. But the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use.

In Greene and Washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said Ami Gatts, director of the Washington-Greene County Job Training Agency. In Westmoreland and Fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.

“I can’t even get them to show up for free food I set up in the office,” said Dave Serock, an ex-miner who recruits in Fayette County for Southwest Training Services.

Programs administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region’s economy, have had similar struggles. One $1.4 million ARC project to teach laid-off miners in Greene County and in West Virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. Not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex-miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said.

Greene County Commissioner Zimmerman said he’d like to see a big company like Amazon or Toyota come to southwestern Pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands.

But he knows first the region needs a ready workforce.

Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in Western Pennsylvania. Toyota spokesman Edward Lewis said the company considers local workforce training an “important consideration” when deciding where to locate facilities.

SIGNS OF LIFE

Sean Moodie and his brother Steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate.

“I am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,” said Sean Moodie.

Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. Like Sylvester, the Moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by Consol’s recruiter, GMS.

Bob Levo, who runs a GMS training program, offered a measure of realism: The point of the training is to provide low-cost and potentially short-term labor to a struggling industry, he said.

“That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,” he said. “They rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.”

Clemmy Allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the United Mineworkers of America’s Career Centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery.

He’s placing his hopes for the region’s future on retraining. UMWA’s 64-acre campus in Prosperity, Pennsylvania - which once trained coal miners - will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.

“Unlike when I worked in the mines,” he said, “if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.”

Os titulares da Defesa e das Relações Exteriores disseram ter indícios de que grupos russos dos setores estatal e privado, além de grupos da Venezuela, usaram Twitter, Facebook e outros sites da internet para divulgar maciçamente a causa separatista e influenciar a opinião pública por trás desta na véspera da votação de 1o de outubro.

Os líderes separatistas catalães negaram que uma interferência da Rússia os tenha ajudado na eleição.

“O que sabemos hoje é que muito disto veio do território russo”, disse a ministra da Defesa espanhola, Maria Dolores de Cospedal, sobre o apoio vindo da Rússia através da Internet.

“Estes são grupos que, pública e privada(mente), estão tentando influenciar a situação e criar instabilidade na Europa”, disse ela aos repórteres após uma reunião de chanceleres e ministros da Defesa da União Europeia em Bruxelas.

Indagado se Madri está certa das acusações, o chanceler espanhol, Alfonso Dastis, também presente ao encontro, respondeu: “Sim, temos provas”.

Dastis disse que a Espanha detectou contas falsas em redes sociais, metade das quais foram rastreadas na Rússia e outras 30 por cento na Venezuela, criadas para amplificar os benefícios da causa separatista republicando mensagens e postagens.

Ramon Tremosa, parlamentar do PDeCat, partido do líder separatista catalão, Carles Puigdemont, na UE, repetiu nesta segunda-feira que a interferência russa não teve nenhum papel no referendo.

“Aqueles que dizem que a Rússia está ajudando a Catalunha são aqueles que ajudaram a frota russa nos últimos anos, apesar do boicote da UE”, tuitou Tremosa em referência a reportagens da mídia espanhola segundo as quais a Espanha está permitindo que navios de guerra russos reabasteçam em seus portos. Aqueles que votaram no referendo optaram na sua maioria pela independência, mas o comparecimento foi só de cerca de 43 por cento, já que grande parte dos catalães favoráveis à permanência da região na Espanha boicotou a consulta.

Dastis afirmou ter abordado o assunto com o Kremlin. Moscou negou várias vezes qualquer interferência do tipo e acusa o Ocidente de uma campanha para desacreditar a Rússia.

A robbery attempt on a Pirelli van after Sunday’s race, which was thwarted by the team’s security staff, was the latest of a string of incidents involving Formula One personnel at Interlagos.

Four-times world champion Lewis Hamilton had called on Formula One to act after mechanics from his Mercedes team were robbed at gunpoint in their mini-van as they left Interlagos on Friday.

The Briton, who was not present at the time, said shots were fired and a gun pointed at one person’s head before valuables were taken.

Sunday’s attack on the Pirelli van took place after security had supposedly been tightened at the track.

“Following a robbery attempt, neutralized by Pirelli security, on a Pirelli van at the Interlagos circuit last Sunday... it has been decided to cancel the tire test,” Pirelli said in a statement on Monday.

The decision was taken with McLaren, who were due to test Pirelli’s 2018 tires with British teenager Lando Norris and Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the governing FIA “in the interest of the safety of the personnel”.

McLaren’s executive director Zak Brown told Reuters the team had put in place additional security measures before the test was called off.

“The circuit needs to get its act together because it’s not acceptable,” he said.

“If we are going to travel to places, we need to make sure that the government and city is doing a good job keeping everyone safe.”

The FIA, whose staff were also targeted on Friday, had promised “heavy police reinforcements” for the weekend.

Despite that, Sauber strategy engineer Ruth Buscombe reported on Twitter that a team van was targeted late on Saturday.

The Interlagos circuit has a history of such attacks, with cars caught in traffic jams or at red stop lights on a road that runs past a hillside slum.

Unlike regular team staff, race drivers travel to and from their hotels with police escorts and in bulletproof cars.

Britain’s Jenson Button was in a car that was attacked outside the circuit in 2010, a year after he won the world championship, but his police driver smashed through the traffic to escape.

“There’s a huge amount of traffic flowing in and out at peak times and, unfortunately, it provides an opportunity for these situations,” Mike Collier, McLaren’s head of human performance who was in the car with Button at the time, told Reuters.

“There is clearly a huge amount of poverty as well and when the race teams arrive, they come with a huge amount of assets and wealth.”",Brazil F1 tire test canceled for security reasons,https://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKBN1DD1Y8-OCASP

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

The world’s largest retailer will start offering higher-end clothing and accessories from Lord & Taylor to its customers in spring 2018.

The partnership will allow Lord & Taylor to open a virtual storefront on Walmart.com and boost customer traffic to its website by reaching a wider audience. It will boost Wal-Mart’s online assortment with premium products and advance the retailer’s effort to access millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com.

“Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination within Walmart.com,” Denise Incandela, Head of Fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce told Reuters in an interview on Monday. She said Wal-Mart shoppers search the retailer’s website for premium items and the company aims to expand its online business with a focus on such products.

“This is a part of a larger business strategy where we are working to create a new Walmart.com,” Incandela said. She did not comment on the financial terms of the partnership.

In the past year, Wal-Mart has been acquiring small online fashion brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos in an attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon and others in the online fashion world.

Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales for that category exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.

But despite its store muscle, Wal-Mart has failed to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but due to its low-income customer base and brand perception, has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.

Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.

Virtual storefronts have become a strong e-commerce tool with retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) routinely offering dedicated space to brands on their website.

L‘AD si è detto certo che, a breve, “ogni pagamento sarà digitale”.","MILANO, 10 novembre (Reuters) - Icbpi e CartaSì lasciano il posto a Nexi, nuova realtà che si pone l‘obiettivo di “costruire, in partnership con le banche, il futuro dei pagamenti digitali in Italia”.

Il nuovo brand del gruppo è stato presentato dal management nel corso di una conferenza stampa nell‘ambito della convention organizzata per presentare le strategie ai partner delle banche.

La storia recente di Icbpi-CartaSì è stata una corsa a perdifiato. Nel dicembre 2015 Mercury Italy -- veicolo partecipato dagli operatori di private equity Bain Capital, Advent International e Clessidra -- ha perfezionato l‘acquisto dell‘85,29% dell‘istituto bancario sulla base di una valutazione del 100% di 2,15 miliardi.

Nella primavera 2016 al gruppo si è aggiunta Setefi, ceduta da Intesa Sanpaolo per circa un miliardo.

A fine 2016 ha acquisito il 100% di Bassilichi per 230 milioni.

In febbraio è toccato alle attività legate al business merchant acquiring di Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena e di Deutsche Bank per 520 milioni.

Insomma, come ha sottolineato l‘AD Paolo Bertoluzzo, gli azionisti “hanno investito quasi 4 miliardi”. E il gruppo ha già annunciato investimenti in tecnologia per 1 miliardo nel quinquennio 2016-2021.

Ora il cambio di brand, con l‘abbandono di Icbpi (indolore, è stato detto più volte, dato il nome poco musicale...) e di CartaSì, marchio che generava nel pubblico “affettività, certo, ma legata al passato”, ha spiegato Bertoluzzo. Insomma, un gruppo focalizzato sul digitale non poteva continuare ad operare tramite un brand con il sostantivo “carta”. Da qui la scelta di varare Nexi, accompagnando il nuovo marchio con lo slogan “every day, every pay”.

La struttura societaria, conseguenza di buyout e successive acquisizioni, resta complessa: “Nel tempo la semplificheremo”, ha detto Bertoluzzo, “ma non è una priorità”.

Il gruppo attualmente gestisce 27 milioni di carte di pagamento, 2,7 miliardi di transazioni per 120 miliardi di euro (il mercato italiano ammonta a poco meno di 200 miliardi), 15.000 sportelli bancari automatici. Altri numeri: 733.000 punti vendita convenzionati, 150 banche partner e 122 miliardi di asset under management.

Ma lo spazio per crescere è enorme. “Per fortuna”, ha ironizzato Bertoluzzo, “il settore è in ritardo in Italia”. Qui, infatti, solo il 20% dei pagamenti è in forma digitale, contro il 40% della media europea, il 65% della Gran Bretagna e i picchi dell‘80% in Scandinavia. L‘AD si è detto certo che, a breve, “ogni pagamento sarà digitale”. Quando? “Un giorno... e questo giorno è oggi”, recita la campagna pubblicitaria di Nexi.

Bertoluzzo e due manager del gruppo (Roberto Catanzaro ed Erika Fattori) hanno spiegato nei dettagli i vantaggi delle transazioni digitali, i prodotti che verranno lanciati, l‘opera di informazione ed educazione nei confronti di commercianti e clienti, la campagna di comunicazione. Tra le novità, nella seconda parte del 2018 Nexi commercializzerà Poynt, un terminale per pagamenti che metterà a disposizione degli esercenti una sorta di app store, un menù completo di funzioni per semplificare le transazioni commerciali, con particolare focus sul contactless. L‘anno prossimo, del resto, è stato evidenziato, segnerà l‘avvento degli instant payments, le transazioni entro massimi dieci secondi, che “cambieranno radicalmente il sistema di pagamento”, ha concluso l‘AD.

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate were debating their respective plans this week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Republicans are aiming to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand Trump his first major legislative victory. The two chambers hope to resolve their differences in time to enact the legislation by the end of the year.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post.

Trump has repeatedly pushed for the tax reform bill to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Neither House nor Senate proposals include such a provision.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

Republican tax plans in the House and Senate would each add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, but lawmakers will have to iron out differences including the treatment of the deduction for state and local taxes, when to start a cut in the corporate tax rate and whether to scrap the estate tax on inheritances.

The House is expected to pass its tax bill this week, while the Senate debates its proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate hoped to have its version ready to be considered the week after Thanksgiving.

The two plans have some different details but are “similar conceptually,” McConnell said in his home state of Kentucky.

Senators began tweaking their proposal on Monday. An amendment introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch would remove the provision that currently lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

The prospects for the provisions Trump pushed were uncertain.

The Senate proposal calls for keeping seven tax brackets but cutting rates, including the top tax rate for the highest earning taxpayers, to 38.5 percent from 39.6 percent. The House wants to reduce the number of brackets, but leave the 39.6 percent top rate alone.

The Congressional Budget Office said last week that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than it originally forecasted.

Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying.

The Trump administration is trying to drum up support for the tax reform effort in U.S. towns and cities as well as on Capitol Hill.

Botox maker Allergan said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will sell 25 million shares to a JP Morgan Chase and Co (JPM.N) unit - acting as a dealer for the shares - sometime next quarter. The JP Morgan unit will pay a price based on the average trading price over a yet-to-be determined period before the sale.

Allergan sold its generics business to Teva in August 2016 for $33 billion in cash and 100 million shares of the Israeli generic drugmaker, worth around $5.3 billion at the time.

Under the terms of the deal, Allergan had to hold the shares for at least one year. That has turned out to be a costly agreement for the drugmaker, as Teva’s shares have lost more than three-fourths of their value since the deal.

Allergan’s shares have lost around a third of their value over that period.

Allergan said on Nov. 1 that it planned to begin selling its Teva stake, and this was the first announced sale of the stock.

Two of Israel’s leading financial news outlets reported later that week that billionaire businessman Len Blavatnik was looking to buy a significant stake in debt-ridden Teva, possibly through a deal with Allergan.

It was not clear who the ultimate buyer of Allergan’s shares will be in the JP Morgan transaction.

In the same filing, Allergan said it had taken a margin loan from JP Morgan on its whole 100 million-share stake in Teva.

India’s annual consumer inflation INCPIY=ECI in October increased to 3.58 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Monday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected October’s CPI inflation rate would edge up to 3.46 percent from September’s 3.28 percent.

Some analysts expect India’s decision on Friday to slash tax rates on 178 items such as chocolates and detergent powders to 18 percent from 28 percent could marginally lower retail inflation in coming months.

“There is, however, a low likelihood of a rate cut by the RBI in the immediate term,” said Aditi Nayar, an economist at ICRA, an Indian arm of the rating agency Moody‘s, adding that inflationary expectations could remain high in the second half of the fiscal year that ends in March.

RBI holds a policy review on Dec. 6.

Retail inflation has been steadily rising since June, when it eased to 1.46 percent - its slowest pace since India started releasing such figures in January 2012, based on combined data for rural and urban consumers.

Separately, annual industrial output INIP=ECI grew a lower-than-expected 3.8 percent in September, compared with the forecast of 4.2 percent by economists in a Reuters poll, data released on Friday showed.

Prices pressures are building just as the Reserve Bank of India projected last month inflation to rise in October-March to 4.2-4.6 percent, above its medium-target of 4 percent, while leaving rates unchanged.

Crude prices have rallied, sending Brent crude to its highest since June 2015, a worry given that India imports most of its energy needs.

Despite a cut in taxes, retail petrol prices have gone up by 7.6 percent and diesel by 6.6 percent in New Delhi in the last year.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces crucial state elections in his home state of Gujarat next month, is under pressure to revive economic growth, which slipped to 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest pace in three years.

New Delhi, facing risks of a widening fiscal deficit this year mainly due to lower growth in revenue receipts, wants the RBI to ease policy rates to support private investments and revive economic growth.",India's October retail inflation touches seven-month high,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-inflation/indias-october-retail-inflation-touches-seven-month-high-idINKBN1DD1FV

I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,” Johnson told lawmakers on Monday.

“Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,” he wrote.","LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a second, fuller apology on Monday for remarks about an Iranian-British aid worker jailed in Iran that critics said might have prompted Iran to extend her prison sentence.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges.

Johnson told a parliamentary committee on Nov. 1 that she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016, contradicting her and her employer, who said she had been on holiday visiting her family.

“It was my mistake. I should have been clearer. I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,” Johnson told lawmakers on Monday. “Our priority now is to do everything we can to get her out of Iran on humanitarian grounds.”

On Nov. 7 Johnson said in the course of an exchange with an opposition MP in parliament that “I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family.”

Opposition British lawmakers had said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson, whose job has come under pressure over the case, said he would meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband this week, adding that the issue was casting a shadow over relations with Iran.

“I shall travel to Iran myself later this year to review the full state of our bilateral relations and to drive home the strength of feeling in this House and in the country at large,” Johnson said.

Earlier on Monday, the government said it was considering granting diplomatic protection to Zaghari-Ratcliffe as part of an effort to secure her release from jail.

It is unclear how such protection could be offered retrospectively to a dual Iranian-British citizen, or whether such a move could help to secure her release, but a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was one option being considered.

“The prime minister has been involved with this case from the outset, she’s raised it with the Iranian president on at least two occasions, the entire government is working towards securing her release as quickly as possible,” he said.

A legal opinion prepared for the human rights charity Redress on Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case said the British government could grant her diplomatic protection as she is “predominantly” a British citizen who has been denied a fair trial.

It is unclear how Tehran would view such a step, which would explicitly make Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s fate an issue in state-to-state relations rather than a purely consular case.

BARGAINING CHIP

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s fate become a major political issue in Britain after Johnson made remarks on Nov. 1 that appeared to cast doubt on statements from her employer.

The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said she had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.

Iranian state television said Johnson’s comments showed Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s guilt and that she was involved in spying.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the case had become a bargaining chip for Iran in its relations with Britain, and that it would not be helpful for Johnson to resign.

He has asked to come with Johnson on a trip to Tehran planned for later this year and called for her to be given diplomatic protection.

“Nazanin is being held because she is British and is being used as a bargaining chip against the UK, now justified by your words,” he said in an article in the Evening Standard newspaper.

“Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,” he wrote.

He added the uncertainty had affected his wife’s health and she had gone to hospital for tests after finding lumps on her breasts, which the specialist thought were benign and stress-related.

British ministers have rallied round Johnson but one of his allies, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, was accused of muddying the waters in a television interview on Sunday when he said he did not know what Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran.",UK's Johnson makes fuller apology for remarks on jailed aid worker in Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-iran-may/britain-considers-diplomatic-protection-for-jailed-aid-worker-in-iran-idUKKBN1DD1DM

Independent reporting by Reuters corroborated some of the findings.

The results of a probe by the IOM into exploitation and trafficking in Bangladesh’s refugee camps, which Reuters reviewed on an exclusive basis, also documented accounts of Rohingya girls as young as 11 getting married, and parents saying the unions would provide protection and economic advancement.

About 450,000 children, or 55 percent of the refugee population, live in teeming settlements near the border with Myanmar after fleeing the destruction of villages and alleged murder, looting and rape by security forces and Buddhist mobs.

Afjurul Hoque Tutul, additional superintendent of police in Cox’s Bazar, near where the camps are based, said 11 checkpoints had been set up that would help prevent children from leaving.

“If any Rohingya child is found working, then the owners will be punished,” he said.

Most of the refugees have arrived in the past two and a half months after attacks on about 30 security posts by Rohingya rebels met a ferocious response from Myanmar’s military.

Described by the United Nations human rights commissioner Zeid Ra‘ad Al Hussein as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”, Myanmar’s government counters that its actions are a proportionate response to attacks by Rohingya “terrorists”.

The IOM’s findings, based on discussions with groups of long-term residents and recent arrivals, and separate interviews by Reuters, show life in the refugee camps is hardly better than it is in Myanmar for Rohingya children.

The IOM said children were targeted by labor agents and encouraged to work by their destitute parents amid widespread malnutrition and poverty in the camps. Education opportunities are limited for children beyond Grade 3.

Rohingya boys and girls as young as seven years old were confirmed working outside the settlements, according to the findings.

Boys work on farms, construction sites and fishing boats, as well as in tea shops and as rickshaw drivers, the IOM and Rohingya residents in the camp reported.

Girls typically work as maids and nannies for Bangladeshi families, either in the nearby resort town of Cox’s Bazar or in Chittagong, Bangladesh’s second-largest city, about 150 km (100 miles) from the camps.

One Rohingya parent, who asked not to be identified because she feared reprisals, told Reuters her 14-year-old daughter had been working in Chittagong as a maid but fled her employers.

When she returned to the camp, she was unable to walk, her mother said, adding that her daughter’s Bangladeshi employers had physically and sexually assaulted her.

“The husband was an alcoholic and he would come to her bedroom at night and rape her. He did it six or seven times,” the mother said. “They gave us no money. Nothing.”

The account could not be independently verified by Reuters but was similar to others recorded by the IOM.

Most interviewees said female Rohingya refugees “experienced sexual harassment, rape and being forced to marry the person who raped her”, the IOM said.

PAID A PITTANCE, IF AT ALL

Across Bangladesh’s refugee settlements, Reuters saw children wandering muddy lanes alone and aimlessly, or sitting listlessly outside tents. Many children begged along roadsides.

The Inter Sector Coordination Group, which oversees UN agencies and charities, said this month it had documented 2,462 unaccompanied and separated children in the camps. The actual number was “likely to be far higher”, it said.

A preliminary survey by the UNHCR and Bangladesh’s Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission has found that 5 percent of households - or 3,576 families - were headed by a child.

Reuters interviewed seven families who sent their children to work. All reported terrible working conditions, low wages or abuse.

Muhammad Zubair, dressed in a dirty football shirt, his small stature belying his stated age of 12 years old, said he was offered 250 taka per day but ended up with only 500 taka ($6) for 38 days work building roads. His mother said he was 14 years old.

“It was hard work, laying bricks on the road,” he said, squatting in the doorway of his mud hut in the Kutupalong camp. He said he was verbally abused by his employers when he asked for more money and was told to leave. He declined to provide their identities.

Zubair then took a job in a tea shop for a month, putting in two shifts per day from 6am to past midnight, broken by a four-hour rest period in the afternoon.

He said he wasn’t allowed to leave the shop and was only permitted to speak to his parents by phone once.

“When I wasn’t paid, I escaped,” he said. “I was frightened because I thought the owner, the master, would come here with other people and take me again.”

FORCED MARRIAGE

Many parents also pressure their daughters to marry early, for protection and for financial stability, according to the IOM findings. Some child brides are as young as 11, the IOM said.

But many women only became “second wives,” the IOM said. Second wives are frequently divorced quickly and “abandoned without any further economic support”.

Kateryna Ardanyan, an IOM anti-trafficking specialist, said exploitation had become “normalized” in the camps.

“Human traffickers usually adapt faster to the situation than any other response mechanism can. It’s very important we try to do prevention.” Ardanyan said.

Tajani sagte der Funke-Mediengruppe: “Wir benötigen doppelt so viel Geld wie heute, also 280 Milliarden Euro statt 140 Milliarden Euro.” Der Italiener begründete das mit Herausforderungen wie der Flüchtlingskrise, dem Anti-Terror-Kampf sowie höheren Investitionen in der EU.

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.

Iran’s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.

The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.

Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.

At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000.

Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children’s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.

ANGRY PEOPLE

Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.

“We need a shelter,” a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. “Where is the aid? Where is the help?” His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.

An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake’s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq’s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran.

Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded.

Iraq’s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district’s only hospital was severely damaged.

“The situation there is very critical,” Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters.

The district’s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.

The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.

“I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.

“I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: ‘Earthquake!'”

An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.

“I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,” a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.

Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah’s main hospital had been badly damaged.

NO SHELTER

Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people.

Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.

Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.

Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said.

Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.

“My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,” Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.

Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.

A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.

“The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,” Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.","Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-quake/strong-earthquake-hits-iraq-and-iran-killing-more-than-450-idUSKBN1DC0VZ

Segundo ele, dos três termômetros da economia operados pela Votorantim no Brasil --alumínio, aço e cimento-- apenas o último ainda não começou a sentir efeitos mais pronunciados da melhora da economia. “Cimento tem um atraso natural...Vai demorar um pouco para começarmos a sentir a retomada”, disse Malacrida.

Na semana passada, a associação de fabricantes de cimento do Brasil, Snic, informou queda de 0,5 por cento nas vendas de cimento no país em outubro, sobre um ano antes, estimando queda de 6 a 7 por cento em 2017 e estabilidade em 2018.

É essa lentidão na retomada do consumo de cimento no Brasil que tem segurado os planos de IPO da unidade, principal do grupo Votorantim, disse Malacrida. Nem a alta de 23 por cento do Ibovespa neste ano e o bem sucedido IPO de sua área de mineração na América do Norte no fim de outubro foram fatores para convencer o grupo a retomar os planos de oferta de ações da área cimenteira, engavetados em 2013.

“Hoje com a capacidade ociosa que ela tem (no Brasil), muito provavelmente teria uma questão sobre como se atribuir valor para isso. O principal motor do cimento é o PIB. É natural que tenha que haver uma perspectiva melhor da economia para voltarmos”, disse o executivo.

“Apesar das tendências positivas, tem uma série de eventos ano que vem que podem mudar o curso das coisas (da economia). As pessoas estão discutindo o impacto do Brexit, Catalunha, Coreia do Norte, eleições no Brasil”, disse Malacrida.

A Votorantim Cimentos fechou setembro com ociosidade de cerca de 50 por cento de sua capacidade de produção no Brasil, de 34 milhões de toneladas por ano. Sessenta por cento das vendas da unidade no Brasil ocorrem em sacos e são destinadas ao chamado “comércio formiga”, de pequenas obras, que dependem da recuperação da renda da população.

No terceiro trimestre, a área de cimentos da Votorantim teve queda de 27 por cento no lucro antes de juros, impostos, depreciação e amortização (Ebitda) sobre um ano antes, a 521 milhões de reais. O resultado foi impactado por efeitos não recorrentes no Brasil. Sem esses efeitos, o recuo no Ebitda seria de 8 por cento.

Apesar da queda no Brasil, nos Estados Unidos o Ebitda da área de cimentos da Votorantim subiu 13 por cento, com a empresa ocupando toda a capacidade de 5,2 milhões de toneladas, concentradas na região dos Grandes Lagos. “Vimos preços melhores (de cimento) no terceiro trimestre e perspectiva super positiva na região”, disse Malacrida, acrescentando que uma fábrica nova do grupo, com capacidade para 600 mil toneladas anuais, deverá iniciar operações no primeiro semestre de 2018 com perspectiva de ter todo o volume ocupado.

CELULOSE

O resultado do grupo também foi impulsionado pela participação na maior fabricante de celulose de eucalipto do mundo, a Fibria, que tem se beneficiado nos últimos meses de um quadro de demanda aquecida e seguidos aumentos de preços no mercado mundial.

A Fibria, na qual a Votorantim tem cerca de 29 por cento, divulgou no final de outubro que teve crescimento de 23 vezes no lucro líquido do período sobre um ano antes.

Questionado sobre os movimentos de consolidação da indústria de celulose no Brasil, Malacrida disse que a Votorantim hoje “não tem nenhuma conversa” com outras empresas do setor. Em setembro, a empresa perdeu a disputa pela rival vizinha Eldorado Brasil para a holandesa Paper Excellence.

A expectativa do mercado com consolidação da indústria de celulose vem de recorrentes declarações de executivos do setor. Na semana passada, o presidente da Suzano, Walter Schalka, afirmou a analistas que a consolidação do setor “é alternativa para se gerar valor” aos investidores.

Malacrida citou relatórios de analistas do mercado de celulose que calculam que o setor tem cerca de 6 bilhões a 8 bilhões de reais em sinergias que poderiam ser aproveitadas em caso de consolidação. “Com esse dinheiro na mesa, é óbvio que todo mundo fala sobre isso...Tudo o que fizer sentido para o nosso portfólio nós vamos fazer. Mas hoje não tem conversa acontecendo”, afirmou.

NEXA E OUTROS NEGÓCIOS

No terceiro trimestre, a Nexa Resources, novo nome da Votorantim Metais após o IPO da área de mineração, teve alta de 5 por cento no Ebitda ajustado, a 161 milhões de dólares. A companhia elevou a produção de cobre no período em 22 por cento, enquanto a de zinco recuou 18 por cento sobre um ano antes, após queda de energia em mina no Peru.

Já a Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio (CBA) teve Ebitda 180 por cento maior no período, a 151 milhões de reais, com o preço do alumínio nos mercados internacionais atingindo maior nível desde dezembro de 2014.

A Votorantim Siderurgia, que combinou negócios com a ArcelorMittal Brasil no começo do ano, teve Ebitda ajustado de 75 milhões de reais, estável ante um ano antes.

Questionado sobre os receios do Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (Cade) sobre a operação, Malacrida afirmou que a Votorantim segue confiante de que o órgão de defesa da concorrência aprovará a operação.

Em setembro, a Superintendência-Geral do Cade recomendou reprovação da operação com a ArcelorMittal Brasil, citando riscos como elevação de preços de aço no Brasil.","Votorantim tem salto no lucro do 3º tri, vê aceleração no 4º",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idBRKBN1DD2L7-OBRBS

Unlike Qatar, the world’s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas with a population of just 300,000, Lebanon has neither the natural nor financial resources to ride it out, and people there are worried.

Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf region, and remittances flowing back into the country, estimated at between $7-8 billion a year, are a vital source of cash to keep the economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning.

“These are serious threats to the Lebanese economy which is already dire. If they cut the transfer of remittances, that will be a disaster,” a senior Lebanese official told Reuters.

Those threats came from Lebanon’s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, who resigned on Nov. 4 in a shock broadcast from Riyadh that Lebanese political leaders have ascribed to pressure from the Saudis.

Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, on Sunday warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living in the Gulf.

And he spelled out Saudi conditions for Lebanon to avoid sanctions: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group that is Lebanon’s main political power and part of the ruling coalition, must stop meddling in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen.

According to a Lebanese source familiar with Saudi thinking, Hariri’s interview “gave an indication of what might be waiting for us if a real compromise is not reached. The playbook is there in Qatar.”

Hariri’s resignation has thrust Lebanon to the center of an escalating rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

The non-confrontational Saudi policy of the past towards Lebanon has gone, analysts say, under the new leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32-year-old son of King Salman.

He is now the de facto ruler of the kingdom, running its military, political and economic affairs.

Whether Iran and Hezbollah are willing to make significant concessions to Riyadh is doubtful, sources said.

“They (Hezbollah) might make some cosmetic concessions, but they won’t submit to the Saudi conditions,” a source familiar with Hezbollah thinking said.

“BALL IN HEZBOLLAH‘S COURT”

Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum said Riyadh wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon and press President Michel Aoun to open dialogue and address their conditions on Hezbollah’s regional interventions.

“They need to come up with a position that will be satisfactory to the Saudis ... If the Saudis decide on sanctions they will do it,” Naoum said.

A source close to Hariri said he had ”put the ball in the court of Aoun, Hezbollah and its allies, by saying ‘business cannot continue as usual.’

“There was no sugar-coating. The sanctions were spelled out clearly. They want Lebanon to be disassociated from Hezbollah”.

Aoun has welcomed comments that the former premier planned to return home soon, palace sources said on Monday.

Saudi frustration with Lebanon seems to have boiled over after a string of setbacks to its foreign policy.

Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015.

Saudi Arabia has accused Iran and Hezbollah of backing the Houthis, and also said Hezbollah had a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month.

Hezbollah and Iran’s involvement in Syria has also transformed the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi support for Sunni rebels in Syria’s civil war have amounted to little.

Hezbollah, a movement with a heavily armed fighting force in addition to seats in parliament and government, is Iran’s spearhead in the region.

Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard looks to be trying to replicate it by building coalitions of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, according to some analysts.

The list of potential sanctions against Lebanon, political sources there say, could include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.

Some of those have been imposed on Qatar, but that blockade, initiated in June, has had limited effect on the emirate so far, beyond driving it closer to Iran.

NEW SAUDI POLICY

Allegiance to foreign backers is not new to Lebanon. Sunnis have always looked to Saudi Arabia for support and funding while Shi‘ite Lebanese tended to turn to Tehran and Hezbollah.

“The Lebanese have always been agents of foreign powers. They take their money, make promises, commitments and alliances,” Naoum said. But while Hezbollah fulfilled its promises to Iran, Sunni factions let Riyadh down, he said.

Thanks in part to Iranian investment in the group, Hezbollah now calls the shots in the Lebanese capital as well as playing a pivotal role in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Riyadh has historically channeled billions of dollars to Lebanon to help its reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war and following massive Israeli incursions of south Lebanon.

Now it appears ready to do serious economic damage to Lebanon that could weaken Hezbollah’s standing at home and in the region, should its demands not be met.

The Saudi conditions are causing alarm among some Lebanese, who have long viewed Hezbollah as a “state-within-a-state”. Many believe the solution is outside the control of local players.

“Lebanon will pay the price,” a top Lebanese banker told Reuters. “The only pressure the Saudis have is economic ... they can put pressure by imposing sanctions that can hurt.”",Fears for Lebanese economy if Saudis impose Qatar-style blockade,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-politics-analysis/fears-for-lebanese-economy-if-saudis-impose-qatar-style-blockade-idUKKBN1DD2I3

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.

“The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe’s security,” May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London’s financial district.

“The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.”

The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations.

The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe.

Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU’s police agency Europol.

May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks.

She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions.

May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.

“We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,” she said.

DXC was formed in April by a merger between CSC and Hewlett’s Enterprise Services business.

To secure the project, Louisiana offered DXC an $18.7 million incentive package in performance-based grants payable over five years, according to a statement from Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards’s office.

DXC shares closed up 0.9 percent at $96.80 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

“These are permanent, direct jobs right here,” Governor Edwards said during a news conference on Monday. “That’s why it’s so exciting.”

A “vast majority” of the jobs will be new positions added to the company’s payroll, DXC spokesperson Rich Adamonis said in an email.

To meet the labor demand, Louisiana will fund a $25 million higher education initiative to increase the amount of degrees awarded in computer science, management and STEM-related studies, the governor’s statement said. “STEM” is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Unlike Qatar, the world’s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas with a population of just 300,000, Lebanon has neither the natural nor financial resources to ride it out, and people there are worried.

Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf region, and remittances flowing back into the country, estimated at between $7-8 billion a year, are a vital source of cash to keep the economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning.

“These are serious threats to the Lebanese economy which is already dire. If they cut the transfer of remittances, that will be a disaster,” a senior Lebanese official told Reuters.

Those threats came from Lebanon’s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, who resigned on Nov. 4 in a shock broadcast from Riyadh that Lebanese political leaders have ascribed to pressure from the Saudis.

Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, on Sunday warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living in the Gulf.

And he spelled out Saudi conditions for Lebanon to avoid sanctions: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group that is Lebanon’s main political power and part of the ruling coalition, must stop meddling in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen.

According to a Lebanese source familiar with Saudi thinking, Hariri’s interview “gave an indication of what might be waiting for us if a real compromise is not reached. The playbook is there in Qatar.”

Hariri’s resignation has thrust Lebanon to the center of an escalating rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

The non-confrontational Saudi policy of the past towards Lebanon has gone, analysts say, under the new leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32-year-old son of King Salman.

He is now the de facto ruler of the kingdom, running its military, political and economic affairs.

Whether Iran and Hezbollah are willing to make significant concessions to Riyadh is doubtful, sources said.

“They (Hezbollah) might make some cosmetic concessions, but they won’t submit to the Saudi conditions,” a source familiar with Hezbollah thinking said.

“BALL IN HEZBOLLAH‘S COURT”

Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum said Riyadh wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon and press President Michel Aoun to open dialogue and address their conditions on Hezbollah’s regional interventions.

“They need to come up with a position that will be satisfactory to the Saudis ... If the Saudis decide on sanctions they will do it,” Naoum said.

A source close to Hariri said he had ”put the ball in the court of Aoun, Hezbollah and its allies, by saying ‘business cannot continue as usual.’

“There was no sugar-coating. The sanctions were spelled out clearly. They want Lebanon to be disassociated from Hezbollah”.

Aoun has welcomed comments that the former premier planned to return home soon, palace sources said on Monday.

Saudi frustration with Lebanon seems to have boiled over after a string of setbacks to its foreign policy.

Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015.

Saudi Arabia has accused Iran and Hezbollah of backing the Houthis, and also said Hezbollah had a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month.

Hezbollah and Iran’s involvement in Syria has also transformed the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi support for Sunni rebels in Syria’s civil war have amounted to little.

Hezbollah, a movement with a heavily armed fighting force in addition to seats in parliament and government, is Iran’s spearhead in the region.

Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard looks to be trying to replicate it by building coalitions of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, according to some analysts.

The list of potential sanctions against Lebanon, political sources there say, could include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.

Some of those have been imposed on Qatar, but that blockade, initiated in June, has had limited effect on the emirate so far, beyond driving it closer to Iran.

NEW SAUDI POLICY

Allegiance to foreign backers is not new to Lebanon. Sunnis have always looked to Saudi Arabia for support and funding while Shi‘ite Lebanese tended to turn to Tehran and Hezbollah.

“The Lebanese have always been agents of foreign powers. They take their money, make promises, commitments and alliances,” Naoum said. But while Hezbollah fulfilled its promises to Iran, Sunni factions let Riyadh down, he said.

Thanks in part to Iranian investment in the group, Hezbollah now calls the shots in the Lebanese capital as well as playing a pivotal role in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Riyadh has historically channeled billions of dollars to Lebanon to help its reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war and following massive Israeli incursions of south Lebanon.

Now it appears ready to do serious economic damage to Lebanon that could weaken Hezbollah’s standing at home and in the region, should its demands not be met.

The Saudi conditions are causing alarm among some Lebanese, who have long viewed Hezbollah as a “state-within-a-state”. Many believe the solution is outside the control of local players.

“Lebanon will pay the price,” a top Lebanese banker told Reuters. “The only pressure the Saudis have is economic ... they can put pressure by imposing sanctions that can hurt.”",Fears for Lebanese economy if Saudis impose Qatar-style blockade,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-analysis/fears-for-lebanese-economy-if-saudis-impose-qatar-style-blockade-idUSKBN1DD2IB

If confirmed, Azar also would take the lead in implementing Trump’s campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 healthcare overhaul passed under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Trump, who is in the Philippines on a diplomatic trip, announced his intention to nominate Azar on Twitter by saying he would “be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.”

Azar’s nomination comes after Trump’s initial health secretary, former U.S. Representative Tom Price, resigned in September amid criticism over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel instead of cheaper commercial flights.

Democrats were cautious in their response to Trump’s announcement with Senator Chuck Schumer calling for the health agency to turn over a new leaf with Azar.

Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who has been working on bipartisan healthcare legislation, tweeted, “Given Alex Azar’s professional background, there are concerns on whether he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients & families.”

Republicans were supportive with Senate health committee head Lamar Alexander of Tennessee describing Azar as a qualified, experienced nominee.

Trump has said he plans to bring down “out-of-control” drug prices.

Azar worked at Eli Lilly (LLY.N) for a decade, including five years as president of its USA affiliate Lilly USA unit, and left the company in January, according to his LinkedIn page.

He also served several years on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobbying group, and earlier was general counsel and deputy secretary for Health and Human Services under former Republican President George W. Bush.

In February, Azar founded a consulting agency that specialized in biopharmaceutical and healthcare companies, his LinkedIn page said.

Patient advocacy organization Public Citizen said Azar has made it clear he is opposed to measures “to restrain prescription companies’ profiteering and limit improper marketing” and that he favors weaker safety approval standards.

As head of HHS, Azar would have oversight responsibility for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the drug industry including approving new treatments.

The U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies: American Tower Corp, SBA Communications Corp, and Crown Castle International Corp.

The agreement announced on Monday shows that Verizon and AT&T, the No. 1 and No. 2 biggest U.S. wireless carriers, are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure better prices for the towers they use to transmit wireless signals, analysts and company officials said.

Both carriers are seeking to add to their network capacity at a time when consumers are using increasing amounts of cellular data.

Carriers are “always looking for alternative partners to lessen their dependence on the big three guys,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.

As part of the agreement, Tillman will construct the towers and AT&T and Verizon will serve as anchor tenants. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018.

“This is Verizon and AT&T working together with a new provider to put some competition into the mix,” said Susan Johnson, AT&T’s senior vice president of supply chain, in an interview, adding, “we do really hope this will be a future model.”

Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate were debating their respective plans this week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Republicans are aiming to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand Trump his first major legislative victory. The two chambers hope to resolve their differences in time to enact the legislation by the end of the year.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post.

Trump has repeatedly pushed for the tax reform bill to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Neither House nor Senate proposals include such a provision.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

Republican tax plans in the House and Senate would each add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, but lawmakers will have to iron out differences including the treatment of the deduction for state and local taxes, when to start a cut in the corporate tax rate and whether to scrap the estate tax on inheritances.

The House is expected to pass its tax bill this week, while the Senate debates its proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate hoped to have its version ready to be considered the week after Thanksgiving.

The two plans have some different details but are “similar conceptually,” McConnell said in his home state of Kentucky.

Senators began tweaking their proposal on Monday. An amendment introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch would remove the provision that currently lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

The prospects for the provisions Trump pushed were uncertain.

The Senate proposal calls for keeping seven tax brackets but cutting rates, including the top tax rate for the highest earning taxpayers, to 38.5 percent from 39.6 percent. The House wants to reduce the number of brackets, but leave the 39.6 percent top rate alone.

The Congressional Budget Office said last week that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than it originally forecasted.

Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying.

The Trump administration is trying to drum up support for the tax reform effort in U.S. towns and cities as well as on Capitol Hill.

A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem ""Els Segadors,"" or ""The Reapers"" has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band's most popular single since they started in 2008. Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy. Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band's lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band's version of ""Els Segadors"" on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band's new full-length album, ""It Was Metal,"" to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that. ""We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like,"" she said. ""But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality."" ""Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician,"" Osegueda said.

REUTERS TOP 75

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Ranked #2: Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

U.S. stock indexes made little ground. Some investors sought bargains after a few days of losses while others were put off by a dividend cut and weak financial forecasts at heavyweight General Electric (GE.N) which plans to radically shrink to focus on aviation, power and healthcare.

Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives’ bill.

“What the market seems to be focused on is if and when tax reform will be agreed on by Republicans in both the Senate and the House and how it’ll fare in Congress,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.

While senators and representatives are trying to reach a deal, investors can still hope, said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

“They’re still working through the math attached to the two plans. They still have to go through reconciliation but the fact the conversations are happening is a positive.”

“Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,” he wrote.","LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a second, fuller apology on Monday for remarks about an Iranian-British aid worker jailed in Iran that critics said might have prompted Iran to extend her prison sentence.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges.

Johnson told a parliamentary committee on Nov. 1 that she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016, contradicting her and her employer, who said she had been on holiday visiting her family.

“It was my mistake. I should have been clearer. I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,” Johnson told lawmakers on Monday. “Our priority now is to do everything we can to get her out of Iran on humanitarian grounds.”

On Nov. 7 Johnson said in the course of an exchange with an opposition MP in parliament that “I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family.”

Opposition British lawmakers had said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson, whose job has come under pressure over the case, said he would meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband this week, adding that the issue was casting a shadow over relations with Iran.

“I shall travel to Iran myself later this year to review the full state of our bilateral relations and to drive home the strength of feeling in this House and in the country at large,” Johnson said.

Earlier on Monday, the government said it was considering granting diplomatic protection to Zaghari-Ratcliffe as part of an effort to secure her release from jail.

It is unclear how such protection could be offered retrospectively to a dual Iranian-British citizen, or whether such a move could help to secure her release, but a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was one option being considered.

“The prime minister has been involved with this case from the outset, she’s raised it with the Iranian president on at least two occasions, the entire government is working towards securing her release as quickly as possible,” he said.

A legal opinion prepared for the human rights charity Redress on Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case said the British government could grant her diplomatic protection as she is “predominantly” a British citizen who has been denied a fair trial.

It is unclear how Tehran would view such a step, which would explicitly make Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s fate an issue in state-to-state relations rather than a purely consular case.

BARGAINING CHIP

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s fate become a major political issue in Britain after Johnson made remarks on Nov. 1 that appeared to cast doubt on statements from her employer.

Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is seen in an undated photograph handed out by her family. Ratcliffe Family Handout via REUTERS

The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said she had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.

Iranian state television said Johnson’s comments showed Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s guilt and that she was involved in spying.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the case had become a bargaining chip for Iran in its relations with Britain, and that it would not be helpful for Johnson to resign.

He has asked to come with Johnson on a trip to Tehran planned for later this year and called for her to be given diplomatic protection.

“Nazanin is being held because she is British and is being used as a bargaining chip against the UK, now justified by your words,” he said in an article in the Evening Standard newspaper.

“Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,” he wrote.

He added the uncertainty had affected his wife’s health and she had gone to hospital for tests after finding lumps on her breasts, which the specialist thought were benign and stress-related.

British ministers have rallied round Johnson but one of his allies, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, was accused of muddying the waters in a television interview on Sunday when he said he did not know what Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran.",UK's Johnson makes fuller apology for remarks on jailed aid worker in Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-iran-johnson/johnson-makes-fuller-apology-for-remarks-on-jailed-aid-worker-in-iran-idUKKBN1DD132

Unlike Qatar, the world’s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas with a population of just 300,000, Lebanon has neither the natural nor financial resources to ride it out, and people there are worried.

Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf region, and remittances flowing back into the country, estimated at between $7-8 billion a year, are a vital source of cash to keep the economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning.

“These are serious threats to the Lebanese economy which is already dire. If they cut the transfer of remittances, that will be a disaster,” a senior Lebanese official told Reuters.

Those threats came from Lebanon’s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, who resigned on Nov. 4 in a shock broadcast from Riyadh that Lebanese political leaders have ascribed to pressure from the Saudis.

Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, on Sunday warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living in the Gulf.

And he spelled out Saudi conditions for Lebanon to avoid sanctions: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group that is Lebanon’s main political power and part of the ruling coalition, must stop meddling in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen.

According to a Lebanese source familiar with Saudi thinking, Hariri’s interview “gave an indication of what might be waiting for us if a real compromise is not reached. The playbook is there in Qatar.”

Hariri’s resignation has thrust Lebanon to the center of an escalating rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

The non-confrontational Saudi policy of the past towards Lebanon has gone, analysts say, under the new leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32-year-old son of King Salman.

He is now the de facto ruler of the kingdom, running its military, political and economic affairs.

Whether Iran and Hezbollah are willing to make significant concessions to Riyadh is doubtful, sources said.

“They (Hezbollah) might make some cosmetic concessions, but they won’t submit to the Saudi conditions,” a source familiar with Hezbollah thinking said.

“BALL IN HEZBOLLAH‘S COURT”

Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum said Riyadh wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon and press President Michel Aoun to open dialogue and address their conditions on Hezbollah’s regional interventions.

“They need to come up with a position that will be satisfactory to the Saudis ... If the Saudis decide on sanctions they will do it,” Naoum said.

A source close to Hariri said he had ”put the ball in the court of Aoun, Hezbollah and its allies, by saying ‘business cannot continue as usual.’

“There was no sugar-coating. The sanctions were spelled out clearly. They want Lebanon to be disassociated from Hezbollah”.

Aoun has welcomed comments that the former premier planned to return home soon, palace sources said on Monday.

Saudi frustration with Lebanon seems to have boiled over after a string of setbacks to its foreign policy.

Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015.

Saudi Arabia has accused Iran and Hezbollah of backing the Houthis, and also said Hezbollah had a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month.

Hezbollah and Iran’s involvement in Syria has also transformed the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi support for Sunni rebels in Syria’s civil war have amounted to little.

Hezbollah, a movement with a heavily armed fighting force in addition to seats in parliament and government, is Iran’s spearhead in the region.

Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard looks to be trying to replicate it by building coalitions of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, according to some analysts.

The list of potential sanctions against Lebanon, political sources there say, could include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.

Some of those have been imposed on Qatar, but that blockade, initiated in June, has had limited effect on the emirate so far, beyond driving it closer to Iran.

NEW SAUDI POLICY

Allegiance to foreign backers is not new to Lebanon. Sunnis have always looked to Saudi Arabia for support and funding while Shi‘ite Lebanese tended to turn to Tehran and Hezbollah.

“The Lebanese have always been agents of foreign powers. They take their money, make promises, commitments and alliances,” Naoum said. But while Hezbollah fulfilled its promises to Iran, Sunni factions let Riyadh down, he said.

Thanks in part to Iranian investment in the group, Hezbollah now calls the shots in the Lebanese capital as well as playing a pivotal role in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Riyadh has historically channeled billions of dollars to Lebanon to help its reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war and following massive Israeli incursions of south Lebanon.

Now it appears ready to do serious economic damage to Lebanon that could weaken Hezbollah’s standing at home and in the region, should its demands not be met.

The Saudi conditions are causing alarm among some Lebanese, who have long viewed Hezbollah as a “state-within-a-state”. Many believe the solution is outside the control of local players.

“Lebanon will pay the price,” a top Lebanese banker told Reuters. “The only pressure the Saudis have is economic ... they can put pressure by imposing sanctions that can hurt.”",Fears for Lebanese economy if Saudis impose Qatar-style blockade,https://www.reuters.com/article/lebanon-politics/analysis-fears-for-lebanese-economy-if-saudis-impose-qatar-style-blockade-idINKBN1DD2KI

Between scandals over sex, secret meetings, political donors and the royal family, the government is melting down.

The country’s own newspapers say so. On Thursday, The Times carried the front page headline “Brussels braced for fall of Theresa May’s government” – this before that government has served half a year.

Where British journalism fails to convey the dimensions of the mess, foreign journalists oblige. Steven Erlanger of The New York Times told his Sunday readers in early November that the country is “heading to nowhere, while on deck, fire has broken out and the captain — poor Theresa May — is lashed to the mast, without the authority to decide whether to turn to port or to starboard.” The Irish writer Fintan O’Toole writes in the New York Review of Books that “Brexit is fueled by fantasies of ‘Empire 2.0,’ a reconstructed global trading empire in which the old colonies will be reconnected to the mother country.”

The first of these, if finely phrased, is overblown; the second is absurd. No one but a real fantasist believes the empire can be reconstituted, or wishes it to be. But schadenfreude is too attractive an emotion to pass up, an occasion to pay the U.K. back for its haughtiness to other countries it deems less well governed than itself.

The real question here is whether the May government can survive. And what happens if it can’t?

The current mess is the result of the workings of democracy, which decreed opening the gates to the barbarians. Barbarians are the forces which mainstream politicians try to keep outside the walls; now, they have forced an entry. In the United States, the invasion is led by Donald Trump: his barbarians are those who take seriously his calls to “drain the swamp” (of Washington) and “put America first.”

Britain’s barbarians have breached the walls of both major parties. Labour is now led by a group of far leftists, gathered around the figure of Jeremy Corbyn, a man who believes in the socialization of much of the economy, has supported and praised the Irish Republican Army, Hamas and Hezbollah and favors a call for the former Labour leader, Tony Blair, to be tried for war crimes. Corbyn and his fellow radical members of parliament were barely tolerated by the rest of their parliamentary colleagues, yet when he ran for Labour’s leadership in 2015, a sudden swell of support from mainly young party members propelled him, astonished, to the leadership. The barbarians had flooded in; the party’s unexpectedly good showing in the general election this summer confirmed they were inside the walls to stay.

The Conservative barbarians are those who hate Britain’s membership in the European Union. The parliamentary barbarian group – a minority – plagued the leadership: John Major, prime minister from 1991-1997, called them, unaware of an open microphone, “bastards.” Their strength forced David Cameron, prime minister from 2010-2016, into the fateful decision to put the issue of EU membership to a referendum. He lost, and so the victorious barbarians inherited the party.

It was not, however, one of their number who became prime minister. That was “poor Theresa May”, an unenthusiastic European Union remainer, who won the party leadership over two Brexiteer challengers, but who fully accepted that the people had spoken and Britain’s exit from the EU would be pursued.

In that pursuit, a sea of troubles has washed about her, and about the country. Many in her cabinet are not Brexiteers; they believe that exit is folly, and seek to extend the period of leaving the Union in order to give British business and finance more time to prepare for the new conditions. The three cabinet members most concerned with Brexit include Boris Johnson, the unpredictable Foreign Secretary, who differed sharply with the cautious chancellor, Philip Hammond, a Remainer, on the timetable for leaving. David Davis, the main negotiator with the EU on the terms of Brexit, was called stupid, lazy and “vain as Narcissus” by the former campaign director of the Vote Leave campaign, a supposed ally. The upper reaches of the governing party are murderous.

Negotiations are, in any case, going badly. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted on a rigid timetable which doesn’t suit the U.K., while issues like the amount the U.K. must pay before leaving remain an obstacle to progress.

The sea has been made much rougher by a growing sexual harassment scandal that led to the resignation of defense minister Michael Fallon. Damian Green, effectively the deputy prime minister, is fighting allegations of harassment and “extreme pornography” said to have been found on his parliamentary computer.

The scandals multiply, usually displayed at the top of TV bulletins and on front pages. A careless remark by Foreign Secretary Johnson may have prolonged the prison sentence of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British citizen jailed in Iran on spying charges, by wrongly claiming she had been training journalists there. Lord Ashcroft, a major Conservative donor, was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” leak to have sheltered a large part of his wealth offshore.

He was not alone: both the Queen and her son, Prince Charles, were revealed by the leak as having benefitted from tax-free shelters.

In the same week, International Development Secretary Priti Patel was forced to resign when she was found to have concealed a series of meetings with Israeli ministers without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or the prime minister. Patel’s replacement – Penny Mordaunt – had to be, like her, a keen Brexiteer; May does not have the freedom to choose on the basis of competence, only on the basis of alignment.

The prime minister is clearly weak, and has been since nearly losing the election to Labour. The enormity of the task – of unpicking hundreds of regulations, laws and agreements while forging new trading links, staunching a retreat of the finance sector from the City of London, attracting new and keeping established investment and combating the Scots nationalists who continue to threaten another referendum on independence – calls for strength and confidence.

Neither is much in evidence. The assumption of weakness is such that speculation on who could follow May as prime minister is a daily game. Most bets are on Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary and former journalist – clever, agile and a keen Brexiteer, but inheriting the same gnawing problems with which May has been forced to grapple. Were the Conservatives to lose their thin majority in the House of Commons on a confidence vote, a new election would be ordered – with the far-left-led Labour Party, on present poll figures, favorite. The country would then be even more deeply divided than before.

This is barbarian rule, otherwise known as democracy. Tens of millions in the democratic world experience insecurity, stagnant incomes or fear of mass immigration – sometimes all of these. They have chosen to vote for barbarians because the civilized people were not, they thought, caring, or at least not responding. Deeply uncomfortable, even dangerous, as the effects are, the rules by which states which offer political choice live must respect these votes. And hope for civilization to win, even among the barbarians.",Commentary: Britain’s mess extends beyond Brexit,https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-brexit-commentary/commentary-britains-mess-extends-beyond-brexit-idUKKBN1DA2ON

U.S. intelligence agencies said in a report in January that the television station, which broadcasts on cable in the United States, is “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine” and that it contributed to the Kremlin’s campaign to interfere with last year’s presidential election in favor of Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

After that report, the Department of Justice insisted that RT America comply with registration requirements under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information.

Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations of election meddling and said it views the actions against RT as an unfriendly act.

But RT’s editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, said on Monday that it would comply with the demand in order to avoid further legal action by the U.S. government.

“Between a criminal case and registration, we chose the latter. We congratulate American freedom of speech and all those who still believe in it,” Simonyan said on Twitter.

The Department of Justice confirmed that it received a registration from T&R Productions LLC, which has operated studios for RT, hired and paid U.S.-based employees and produced English-language programming.

“Americans have a right to know who is acting in the United States to influence the U.S. government or public on behalf of foreign principals,” said acting Assistant Attorney General Dana Boente.

In October, Twitter announced it would no longer allow advertisements from RT and another Kremlin-backed news organization, citing intelligence that the television station participated in efforts to influence the election.

FARA requires foreign governments, political parties and the lobbyists and public relations firms they hire in the United States to register with the Department of Justice. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War Two in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts.

Foreign government-owned news organizations, including China Daily, the English-language newspaper owned by China’s government, register under FARA. The law applies to companies that are owned or controlled by foreign governments.

The United States and Russia are engaged in a back-and-forth over “foreign agent” registration.

Russia’s parliament warned on Friday that some U.S. and other foreign media could also be declared “foreign agents” in response to the actions against RT, requiring them to regularly declare full details of their funds, financing and staffing.

U.S. government-sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), CNN and Germany’s Deutsche Welle could all be affected by the retaliatory measures, a senior Russian lawmaker said earlier on Monday.

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

U.S. District Judge William Walls sent the jurors home for the day and told them to resume their deliberations on Tuesday, Steven Sandberg, a representative for Menendez, said in an email.

A representative for the court clerk’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Menendez is on trial on charges that he accepted private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors between 2006 and 2013.

Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship.

If Menendez is convicted, Republicans will be presented with a chance to gain a seat in the closely divided U.S. Senate, as his replacement would be named by Republican Governor Chris Christie. Christie will remain in office until Jan. 16, when Democratic governor-elect Phil Murphy will take his place.

The jury, beginning its first day of deliberations with a new member after another panelist was allowed to leave for a previously scheduled vacation, sent the judge a note on Monday afternoon saying they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict on any of the counts, the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper reported.

“Is there any additional guidance and what do we do now?” the jury asked the judge in their note, according to the newspaper.

The judge then heard from attorneys from both the prosecution, who argued that the jury had only begun their deliberations again three hours earlier that day, and Menendez’s attorney, who argued for the judge to declare a mistrial, the Star-Ledger said.

Walls concluded that it would be appropriate for the jury to continue their deliberations.

Slow progress in the talks with the European Union has unsettled businesses and drawn warnings that unless a transition is agreed soon, some may begin activating Brexit contingency plans - which may include moving out of Britain.

May had invited 15 business groups from Britain and continental Europe for talks in her Downing Street office to urge them to back her Brexit strategy and persuade companies not to move overseas.

The executives told May she needed to provide more clarity on three issues critical for talks to progress: negotiating any potential exit bill, settling the rights of EU citizens living in Britain, and arrangements for the border in Ireland.

“Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress,” said Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, a lobby group that speaks for companies in European countries, including Britain.

May wants to agree with the EU the broad outline of a so-called implementation period of around two years after Britain’s exit from the EU in March 2019. During that period, its access to the EU single market would remain largely unchanged while new arrangements were put in place.

International companies have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks over fears that Britain will leave the EU without a trade deal, a move that would send shockwaves through global markets and fracture some supply chains.

Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said all the businesses at the meeting warned May about the damage leaving without a trade deal could do.

“We now need to move beyond warm words if jobs, investment and living standards are to be protected,” she said.

Talks between Britain and the EU are currently deadlocked.

The European Union told Britain last week to spell out what it will pay Brussels when it leaves the bloc in 2019 or face more delay in talks on future trade ties that are vital for business.

Progress at a Brussels summit next month is seen as an important milestone in the talks as businesses seek clarity by the new year when many will take investment decisions dependent on conditions after Brexit.

May has stepped up her engagement with businesses in recent months, regularly meeting with British lobby groups and senior executives, but they say the government has offered little detail about what a future trade deal will actually look like.

Monday’s meeting was the first time she expanded that program to include representatives from industry groups from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and other member states as well as EU-wide organizations.

They also met business minister Greg Clark, Brexit minister David Davis and the junior Treasury minister Stephen Barclay.

Danny McCoy, chief executive of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, told national broadcaster RTE that Davis had outlined plans for a free-trade agreement that involved no tariffs and no regulatory barriers.

“That was one of the more concrete things to come out from the discussion,” he said. “For business, I would be more confident today than I was a week ago that we can avoid a hard Brexit.”",CEOs urge British PM May to speed up Brexit talks to avoid exodus,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-business/ceos-urge-may-to-speed-up-brexit-talks-to-avoid-exodus-idUKKBN1DD18W

Actor Divya Unny poses outside her residence in Mumbai, November 11, 2017. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade

Instead, she was called to the director’s hotel room at 9 pm, where the man propositioned her for sex and told her she would have to make compromises if she wanted to succeed in the film industry.

""You always hear of actresses getting called by directors to hotel rooms at night, but I didn’t think twice because I was going in with a reference.""



Unny said she rejected the advances of the director, whom she declined to name, and left without a role in the movie. Reuters was unable to confirm her accusations.

Three other women involved in India's film industry, the world's largest, told Reuters that Unny’s experience isn't unique. But even after allegations of sexual assault and harassment levelled at Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein prompted a wave of similar complaints, Bollywood has been reluctant to name and shame perpetrators.

""The way men are being called out in Hollywood right now, I don’t know if it can happen in India,"" said Alankrita Shrivastava, a director whose last film, “Lipstick Under my Burkha” was acclaimed for its examination of women and sexuality.

“In terms of how our psychology is, how patriarchy functions, it is much more entrenched,” she said.

The vast majority of Bollywood's biggest producers and film-makers are men, many from prominent film families who until recently controlled most of the industry.

Mukesh Bhatt, who co-heads production house Vishesh Films, said India's film industry should not be singled out and was limited in what more it could do to prevent harassment.

""What can we do? We cannot do any moral policing,"" Bhatt told Reuters in a telephone interview.





""We cannot keep moral cops outside every film office to see that no girl is being exploited.""

The industry also had to be cautious about false allegations, said Bhatt, who was previously the chairman of apex industry body, the Film and Television Producers Guild of India.

“I am not saying men have not been exploitative. They have been for centuries. But today’s woman is also not as simple as she pretends to be,” he said. “But just as there are good men and bad men, so also there are women who are exploitative and very cunning. Also blatantly shameless to offer themselves.” He declined to provide any examples.

FEW COMPLAINTS

Despite laws requiring Indian companies to form internal committees to investigate sexual harassment at the workplace, very few of cases are reported to the police, said women's rights activist and lawyer, Flavia Agnes.

""They (companies) may have a committee or they may not have one. They may do an investigation or they may not do one. And they may or may not file a complaint. It could go wrong at every stage.""



Reports of sexual assault, while rare, are not unheard of in India’s film industry.

Earlier this year, Gopalakrishnan Padmanabhan Pillai, a popular actor in the Malayalam film industry best known by his stage name Dileep, was arrested by police who accused him and several others of kidnapping and molesting an actress. Dileep denies the accusations.

“He says it is a completely false case. He was framed by the police and some enemies,” B Raman Pillai, a lawyer for Dileep, told Reuters.

Fans cheered and distributed sweets as he walked out on bail last month after more than 80 days in prison. The police haven’t filed formal charges in court, after which a date for the trial would be set.

“We will file a charge sheet in the next two weeks. Maybe next week,” Biju Paulose, an inspector of police in charge of the case, told Reuters by phone.

HARASSMENT DEPICTED AS LOVE

Kangana Ranaut is one of the few Bollywood actresses who has publicly spoken out about the sexual assault and harassment. Ranaut, who has appeared in 30 films in the past decade, told Reuters she had faced ""severe sexual exploitation and harassment at the work place"", without elaborating.

""I've read some stories (about harassment) shared by few prominent people, but most people find it hard to open up about such experiences,"" she said.





""Victim shaming is very common in our society, it’s done brutally and openly.""



According to a survey conducted by the Indian National Bar Association this year, around 70 percent of Indian women said they would not report sexual harassment at the workplace because they weren’t confident about the complaint mechanism and because of the stigma attached to victims.

Shrivastava, the director, said the kind of cinema Bollywood often produces demonstrates its attitude towards sexual harassment and assault.

For example, two of this year's hit movies - ""Toilet – Ek Prem Katha"" and “Badrinath Ki Dulhania” - showed the hero stalking the leading lady, taking pictures of her without her knowledge.

“For decades, we have created cinema where harassment is depicted as love,” Shrivastava said. “And that reflects the mentality of the creators – that they keep portraying it, and excusing it in the name of commerce.”","In the wake of Weinstein, some women say Bollywood failing to address harassment",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-entertainment-harassment/in-the-wake-of-weinstein-some-women-say-bollywood-failing-to-address-harassment-idINKBN1DD0ZN

Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives’ bill.

“What the market seems to be focused on is if and when tax reform will be agreed on by Republicans in both the Senate and the House and how it’ll fare in Congress,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.

While senators and representatives are trying to reach a deal, investors can still hope, said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

Amazon said it will produce a multi-season series that explores new storylines preceding author J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the first installment in the famed fantasy trilogy.

Three movies made of the trilogy in the early 2000s, filmed in New Zealand and based on Tolkien’s novels, garnered nearly $3 billion at the box office and 17 Academy Awards.

New Line Cinema, which distributed the film trilogy, the Tolkien Estate and Trust, and publisher HarperCollins will work with Amazon to produce the television series.

Amazon did not say how much it was paying for the rights.

The project underscores a shift in Amazon’s video programming. Its studio started in 2010 with a focus on unique shows beloved by critics, such as “Transparent,” about a father coming out as transgender to his family.

That was a winning formula for attracting Hollywood talent, awards and buzz, though not Prime subscribers around the world.

Now, Amazon is looking for a dramatic show that could be a hit globally, much like HBO’s popular fantasy series “Game of Thrones.”

This puts Amazon in uncharted territory, with higher-than-usual production costs expected so it can transport viewers to Middle Earth.

Amazon justifies its spending on programming as a way to draw new sign-ups to Prime, whose members buy more goods more often from the world’s largest online retailer.

“Amazon is committed to producing super high quality, recognized, branded entertainment,” said Wedbush Securities industry analyst Michael Pachter. “That’s a departure from shows like ”Transparent“ and ”Catastrophe.“”

The 26-year-old, finally beginning to consistently deliver on his huge potential, edged the so-called “battle of the backhands” after a compelling two hours 21 minutes.

Dimitrov, the first Bulgarian to qualify for the tournament in its 48-year-old history, overcame some late jitters to prevail in the opening Pete Sampras Group match.

The world number six served for the match at 5-4 in the decider but was broken to love before two consecutive double faults by Thiem gave him another chance to close it out.

Again Dimitrov wobbled, squandering two match points at 40-15 with a double-fault and a tight forehand error, but he finally bagged the win when Thiem looped a backhand long.

“The first time I got broken (at 5-4) I thought ‘okay let’s get back up and try again’,” Dimitrov, who enjoyed some noisy support from a contingent of Bulgarian fans, said on court.

Nepal’s rivers, cascading from the snow-capped Himalayas, have vast, untapped potential for hydropower generation, but lack of funds and technology have made Nepal lean on neighbour India to meet annual demand of 1,400 megawatts (MW).

In June a Maoist-dominated coalition government awarded a contract to China Gezhouba Group Corporation to build a 1,200 MW plant on the Budhi Gandaki river, about 50 km (32 miles) west of Kathmandu, to address acute power shortages.

First proposed in the 1950s and long resisted by Britain, European defense planning, operations and weapons development now stands its best chance in years as London steps aside and the United States pushes Europe to pay more for its security.

Foreign and defense ministers gathered at a signing ceremony in Brussels to represent 23 EU governments joining the pact, paving the way for EU leaders to sign it in December.

Those governments will for the first time legally bind themselves into joint projects as well as pledging to increase defense spending and contribute to rapid deployments.

“Today we are taking a historic step,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters. “We are agreeing on the future cooperation on security and defense issues ... it’s really a milestone in European development,” he said.

The pact includes all EU governments except Britain, which is leaving the bloc, Denmark, which has opted out of defense matters, Ireland, Portugal and Malta. Traditionally neutral Austria was a late addition to the pact.

Paris originally wanted a vanguard of EU countries to bring money and assets to French-led military missions and projects, while Berlin has sought to be more inclusive, which could reduce effectiveness.

Its backers say that if successful, the formal club of 23 members will give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling international crises and end the kind of shortcomings seen in Libya in 2011, when European allies relied on the United States for air power and munitions.

Unlike past attempts, the U.S.-led NATO alliance backs the project, aiming to benefit from stronger militaries.

The club will be backed by a 5-billion-euro defense fund for buying weapons, a special fund to finance operations and money from the EU’s common budget for defense research.

Members will also be required to submit national plans and be subject to a review system identifying weak spots in European armies with the goal of plugging those gaps together.

Many governments say Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 was a turning point, after years of defense spending cuts that left Europe without vital capabilities.

“This is a commitment for countries to do better together,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. “It comes at a time of significant tension,” he said, referring indirectly to Russia’s rising military reach and Islamic militants who have attacked European cities.

ROLE FOR BRITAIN?

Despite an Anglo-French-led EU defense integration effort in 1998, Britain blocked formal collaboration on military matters, wary of the creation of an EU army.

Defense integration was revived by France and Germany, with support from Italy and Spain, in a show of unity after Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016.

The EU had struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and in Africa over the past 20 years and were caught off guard by Russia’s Crimea annexation.

As the EU initiative, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation, has gained momentum, British officials have been pressing for involvement. Britain’s aerospace industry and its biggest defense firm BAE Systems (BAES.L) fear losing out, diplomats said.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson likened London’s support to Gothic architecture, saying: “We are there, like a flying buttress to support the cathedral,” he told reporters.

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

Canada’s three-year immigration plan would see immigration rise by 40,000 to 340,000 people annually in 2020.

Representatives Frank Pallone and Elijah Cummings cited FCC decisions that benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a media report last year that the election campaign of President Donald Trump struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.

“All of these actions – when taken in context with reported meetings between the Trump administration, Sinclair, and Chairman Pai’s office – have raised serious concerns about whether Chairman Pai’s actions comply with the FCC’s mandate to be independent,” the pair wrote.

Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August that Sinclair forces its stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.”

A spokeswoman for Pai said the “request appears to be part of many Democrats’ attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views ... Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.”

Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.

Sinclair did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, told a congressional committee last month, “All of our media policy decisions seem to be custom-built for this one company.”

Sinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.

The FCC is set to vote Thursday on Pai’s plan to eliminate the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market and make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market. Approval would make it easier for Sinclair to acquire more TV stations.

The FCC will also vote Thursday on Pai’s proposal to allow broadcasters to use new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, but it could force consumers to eventually buy new equipment.

If confirmed, Azar also would take the lead in implementing Trump’s campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 healthcare overhaul passed under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Trump, who is in the Philippines on a diplomatic trip, announced his intention to nominate Azar on Twitter by saying he would “be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.”

Azar’s nomination comes after Trump’s initial health secretary, former U.S. Representative Tom Price, resigned in September amid criticism over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel instead of cheaper commercial flights.

Democrats were cautious in their response to Trump’s announcement with Senator Chuck Schumer calling for the health agency to turn over a new leaf with Azar.

Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who has been working on bipartisan healthcare legislation, tweeted, “Given Alex Azar’s professional background, there are concerns on whether he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients & families.”

Republicans were supportive with Senate health committee head Lamar Alexander of Tennessee describing Azar as a qualified, experienced nominee.

Trump has said he plans to bring down “out-of-control” drug prices.

Azar worked at Eli Lilly (LLY.N) for a decade, including five years as president of its USA affiliate Lilly USA unit, and left the company in January, according to his LinkedIn page.

He also served several years on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobbying group, and earlier was general counsel and deputy secretary for Health and Human Services under former Republican President George W. Bush.

In February, Azar founded a consulting agency that specialized in biopharmaceutical and healthcare companies, his LinkedIn page said.

Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate were debating their respective plans this week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Republicans are aiming to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand Trump his first major legislative victory. The two chambers hope to resolve their differences in time to enact the legislation by the end of the year.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post.

Trump has repeatedly pushed for the tax reform bill to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Neither House nor Senate proposals include such a provision.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

Republican tax plans in the House and Senate would each add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, but lawmakers will have to iron out differences including the treatment of the deduction for state and local taxes, when to start a cut in the corporate tax rate and whether to scrap the estate tax on inheritances.

The House is expected to pass its tax bill this week, while the Senate debates its proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate hoped to have its version ready to be considered the week after Thanksgiving.

The two plans have some different details but are “similar conceptually,” McConnell said in his home state of Kentucky.

Senators began tweaking their proposal on Monday. An amendment introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch would remove the provision that currently lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

The prospects for the provisions Trump pushed were uncertain.

The Senate proposal calls for keeping seven tax brackets but cutting rates, including the top tax rate for the highest earning taxpayers, to 38.5 percent from 39.6 percent. The House wants to reduce the number of brackets, but leave the 39.6 percent top rate alone.

The Congressional Budget Office said last week that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than it originally forecasted.

Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying.

The Trump administration is trying to drum up support for the tax reform effort in U.S. towns and cities as well as on Capitol Hill.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump said in a joint statement on Saturday they would continue to fight against Islamic State in Syria, while agreeing that there was no military solution to the country’s wider, six-year-old conflict.

”I am having trouble understanding these comments,“ Erdogan told reporters before flying to Russia for talks with Putin. ”If a military solution is out of the question, then those who say this should pull their troops out.

“Then a political method should be sought in Syria, ways to head into elections should be examined... We will discuss these with Putin,” he said.

After more than four hours of talks with Putin in the southern Russian resort of Sochi, Erdogan said the two leaders had agreed to focus on a political solution to the conflict.

“We agreed that the grounds to focus on a political solution (in Syria) have been formed,” he said.

Putin said Russia would continue to work on Syria with Turkey and their efforts were yielding results: “The level of violence has definitely been reduced, favorable conditions are being created for the progression of a inter-Syrian dialogue.”

Neither leader went into more specific detail. Asked if the two discussed Erdogan’s earlier comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks were about more complex issues which could not be made public, according to RIA news agency.

Turkey has been annoyed by both Russian and U.S. missions in Syria. Before his trip to Russia, Erdogan said both Moscow, which backs President Bashar al-Assad, and Washington, which armed Syrian YPG Kurdish forces Ankara sees as allied to separatists fighting in southeastern Turkey, had set up bases.

“The United States said it would completely leave Iraq, but it didn‘t. The world is not stupid, some realities are being told differently and practiced differently,” he said.

He said the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The YPG has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces.

Russia has been a strong supporter of Assad, whose removal Erdogan has demanded, and Moscow’s military intervention two years ago helped turn the conflict in the Syrian president’s favor.

Turkish troops have also fought in Syria to halt the advance of Kurdish YPG forces along its frontier.

“We attach great importance to the joint steps Turkey and Russia will take on (the) defense industry,” Erdogan said.

His remarks follow Turkey’s recently completed purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a defense deal that Turkey’s Western allies see as a snub to the NATO alliance.

The weapon cannot be integrated into NATO defenses.

Ankara says it is making agreements with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium to develop, produce and use its own sources for air defense system.","Erdogan swipes at Russia, U.S. missions in Syria",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-turkey-russia/erdogan-swipes-at-russia-u-s-missions-in-syria-idUKKBN1DD2KW

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices.","(Reuters) - General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company’s shares to a five-year low.

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

The British Prime Minister faces growing challenges to her leadership from her Conservative party’s pro- and anti-European Union factions. Political disarray increases the risks that quitting the bloc will inflict serious harm on the economy. A softer Brexit is becoming harder to deliver.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in London, Britain November 9, 2017

A clear sign that investors are getting more nervous came on Monday when sterling shed a full cent against the U.S. dollar, falling below $1.31. The trigger was a Sunday Times report that 40 Conservative deputies had agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in May – eight short of the number needed to trigger a leadership contest. A sharp jump in options prices that reflect how much traders expect the pound to gyrate against the dollar in the next month underscores the market jitters.

Fair enough. May is struggling to convince other EU countries that Britain has made enough compromises on Brexit issues they want resolved before moving on to discussing trade. Ejecting her would require the Conservatives to spend weeks choosing a new leader. A general election might have to be called to confirm her replacement’s mandate, possibly leading to a change of government. This would delay negotiations about trading arrangements to allow continued tariff-free movement of goods between Britain and the rest of the EU. It would also make it harder to secure a transition period that would delay the impact of the new arrangements beyond the March 2019 Brexit date.

The longer the clock ticks without tangible progress on trading terms and conditions, the more likely businesses are to move jobs and investment out of the United Kingdom. Investors’ patience will run out even sooner. They have so far assumed that the prime concern of British politicians is to minimise economic damage: the Breakingviews Brexit indicator, which incorporates signals from currency, bond, stock, and credit default swap prices, has been relatively stable in recent months.

A fifth woman came forward on Monday with new allegations that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager in Alabama and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore, who has refused to step aside, denied the charges and his campaign said he was the victim of a “witch hunt.”

McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials were considering whether a Republican write-in candidate could be found to challenge Moore in the Dec. 12 special election.

“I think he should step aside,” said McConnell, who had previously said Moore should leave the race if the allegations were true. “I believe the women.”

Republican Senator Susan Collins joined McConnell in calling for Moore to drop out, saying she was not convinced by his denials.

The head of the Senate Republican campaign arm, Senator Cory Gardner, said Moore was unfit to serve in the Senate.

“If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,” Gardner said in a statement.

Moore, a Christian conservative and former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, had been a heavy favorite to win the election against Democrat Doug Jones. He has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.

He said on Twitter that McConnell was the person who should step down.

“He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” Moore said.

The state party and many other Alabama Republicans have not wavered in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive primary victory in September over Luther Strange. Strange, who earned the support of President Donald Trump in the primary, was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became U.S. attorney general earlier this year.

The growing furor over Moore sets up a confrontation between establishment Republicans and the party’s populist movement, led by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. That could endanger the Republican hold on the Senate seat.

A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s midterm elections, giving Democrats a shot at gaining the three seats they need to recapture control of the U.S. Senate.

It is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot but McConnell told reporters he was “looking at” potential write-in candidates who could mount a successful campaign. Asked if Strange might be a candidate again, he said “We’ll see.”

On Twitter, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said Strange was “an excellent alternative.”

The special election had been a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, was trailing by double digits in some polls.

Moore, who is prone to incendiary comments on social and cultural issues, has survived controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

He threatened to sue the Post over the weekend and said the allegations in its story were a smear campaign by his political opponents. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

The new accusation came at a news conference in New York, where Beverly Young Nelson said Moore had groped her while giving her a ride home from the diner where she worked when she was 16 years old.

“I was terrified. I thought he was going to rape me,” she said.

The new conference was arranged by lawyer Gloria Allred, who has represented women in a number of high-profile sexual misconduct cases. Moore’s campaign said Allred was trying to create a spectacle.

Qualcomm’s board of directors could meet as early as Sunday to review the unsolicited acquisition offer and decide on its strategy, the sources said. The preparations for the board meeting indicate that Qualcomm is poised to rebuff the bid as insufficient as early as Monday, although it may decide to spend a few more days this week to prepare its full response to Broadcom, the sources added.

Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf has spent the past few days soliciting feedback from Qualcomm shareholders, and feels that Broadcom’s $70-per-share bid undervalues the company and does not price in the uncertainty associated with getting the deal approved by regulators, according to the sources.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, who said earlier this month he would redomicile his company to the United States from Singapore, has stated he is open to launching a takeover battle. The sources said Broadcom was preparing to submit a slate of directors by Qualcomm’s Dec. 8 nomination deadline. That would allow Qualcomm shareholders to vote to replace the company’s board and force it to engage with Broadcom.

Broadcom has also been deliberating the possibility of raising its bid for Qualcomm, including through more debt financing, some of the sources said, although it was not clear when Broadcom would choose to make such a move.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data. It is engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and is also trying to close its $38 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) after signing a deal in October 2016. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to acquire Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

NXP shares have been trading above Qualcomm’s offer price, as many NXP shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have been holding out for a better price. Qualcomm does not plan to significantly raise its price for NXP as a defensive strategy to make its acquisition by Broadcom more expensive, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm shares closed at $64.57 on Friday, while Broadcom ended at $264.96.

Army spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said in a statement the army pulled back its troops late on Saturday after General Paul Malong agreed to reduce the number of his bodyguards.

Malong’s wife Lucy Ayak told Reuters by phone from Nairobi that her husband remains under house arrest but said the troop withdrawal is a “sign of peace.” Ayak could not confirm if the reduction of bodyguards took place.

Malong led the army’s war effort against rebels from 2014, but was sacked and placed under house arrest this May after a fall-out with President Salva Kiir.

Last weekend, Kiir sent troops to disarm Malong’s bodyguards, but they refused. Kiir’s troops surrounded the house.

Malong is under U.S. sanctions and has been accused, along with Kiir, by a U.N. experts panel of leading troops who murdered and raped civilians during the civil war.

South Sudan’s war began in 2013 between Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer.

Tens of thousands have been killed and the war has created Africa’s largest refugee crisis in two decades. The U.N. said the conflict’s ethnic cleansing was setting the stage for genocide.

Malong is also Dinka, and the standoff with Kiir raised fears of fighting within the ethnic group, which is South Sudan’s largest and comprises the bulk of the army and the government’s ruling coalition.

One commander loyal to Malong joined Machar’s rebels with dozens of armed troops during the standoff. Dinka leaders from around the nation convened to negotiate a solution.

Earlier in the week, Malong requested the U.N. mission in South Sudan to intervene and give him protection. Malong’s troops have been accused of attacking UN installations and killing peacekeepers.

A fifth woman came forward on Monday with new allegations that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager in Alabama and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore, who has refused to step aside, denied the charges and his campaign said he was the victim of a “witch hunt.”

McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials were considering whether a Republican write-in candidate could be found to challenge Moore in the Dec. 12 special election.

“I think he should step aside,” said McConnell, who had previously said Moore should leave the race if the allegations were true. “I believe the women.”

Republican Senator Susan Collins joined McConnell in calling for Moore to drop out, saying she was not convinced by his denials.

The head of the Senate Republican campaign arm, Senator Cory Gardner, said Moore was unfit to serve in the Senate.

“If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,” Gardner said in a statement.

Moore, a Christian conservative and former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, had been a heavy favorite to win the election against Democrat Doug Jones. He has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.

Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.

Iran’s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.

The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.

Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.

At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000.

Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children’s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.

ANGRY PEOPLE

Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.

“We need a shelter,” a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. “Where is the aid? Where is the help?” His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.

An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake’s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq’s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran.

Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded.

Iraq’s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district’s only hospital was severely damaged.

“The situation there is very critical,” Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters.

The district’s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.

The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.

“I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.

“I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: ‘Earthquake!'”

An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.

“I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,” a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.

Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah’s main hospital had been badly damaged.

Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people.

Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.

Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.

Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said.

Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.

“My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,” Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.

Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.

A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.

“The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,” Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.","Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-iraq-quake/strong-earthquake-hits-iraq-and-iran-killing-more-than-450-idUKKBN1DC0WM

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump said in a joint statement on Saturday they would continue to fight against Islamic State in Syria, while agreeing that there was no military solution to the country’s wider, six-year-old conflict.

”I am having trouble understanding these comments,“ Erdogan told reporters before flying to Russia for talks with Putin. ”If a military solution is out of the question, then those who say this should pull their troops out.

“Then a political method should be sought in Syria, ways to head into elections should be examined... We will discuss these with Putin,” he said.

After more than four hours of talks with Putin in the southern Russian resort of Sochi, Erdogan said the two leaders had agreed to focus on a political solution to the conflict.

“We agreed that the grounds to focus on a political solution (in Syria) have been formed,” he said.

Putin said Russia would continue to work on Syria with Turkey and their efforts were yielding results: “The level of violence has definitely been reduced, favorable conditions are being created for the progression of a inter-Syrian dialogue.”

Neither leader went into more specific detail. Asked if the two discussed Erdogan’s earlier comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks were about more complex issues which could not be made public, according to RIA news agency.

Turkey has been annoyed by both Russian and U.S. missions in Syria. Before his trip to Russia, Erdogan said both Moscow, which backs President Bashar al-Assad, and Washington, which armed Syrian YPG Kurdish forces Ankara sees as allied to separatists fighting in southeastern Turkey, had set up bases.

“The United States said it would completely leave Iraq, but it didn‘t. The world is not stupid, some realities are being told differently and practiced differently,” he said.

He said the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The YPG has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces.

Russia has been a strong supporter of Assad, whose removal Erdogan has demanded, and Moscow’s military intervention two years ago helped turn the conflict in the Syrian president’s favor.

Turkish troops have also fought in Syria to halt the advance of Kurdish YPG forces along its frontier.

“We attach great importance to the joint steps Turkey and Russia will take on (the) defense industry,” Erdogan said.

His remarks follow Turkey’s recently completed purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a defense deal that Turkey’s Western allies see as a snub to the NATO alliance.

The weapon cannot be integrated into NATO defenses.

Ankara says it is making agreements with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium to develop, produce and use its own sources for air defense system.","Erdogan swipes at Russia, U.S. missions in Syria",https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-turkey-russia/erdogan-swipes-at-russia-u-s-missions-in-syria-idINKBN1DD2JQ

Anxious not to push Caracas any closer to economic and political collapse as debt restructuring talks begin, EU governments held back from targeting any individuals.

The bloc instead left names for a later stage to try to persuade President Nicholas Maduro to calm the situation.

“Everything we do is aimed at seeking dialogue between the government and the opposition to find a democratic and peaceful solution,” Spain’s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters at a meeting with his counterparts where the sanctions decision was made.

Venezuelan opposition leaders said last week they would resume efforts to hold a dialogue with Maduro, even though they say he previously used such talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform.

Over the weekend, Maduro had termed imminent sanctions by the bloc as “stupid.”

On Monday, his government said the “illegal” and “absurd” EU measures were a violation of international norms.

“The European institutions show their lamentable and shameful subordination to the U.S. government,” it added.

Spain has long pushed for sanctions on those close to Maduro, whom Washington accuses of installing a dictatorship and slapped sanctions on in July. But the EU has been divided over whom to target.

The arms embargo adds Venezuela to an EU list that includes North Korea and Syria, where European defense companies can no longer do business and to which the sale of any goods deemed as being used for repression are also banned.

Britain sold 1.4 million pounds ($1.83 million) worth of arms to Venezuela between May 2010 and March 2017, according to The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which lobbies to end arms sales to repressive governments.

“GRADUAL AND FLEXIBLE” SANCTIONS

In a joint statement, all 28 EU ministers said the legal basis for individual travel bans to the EU and the freezing of any Venezuelan assets in the bloc “will be used in a gradual and flexible manner and can be expanded.”

Representatives of Maduro’s government were due to meet investors in Caracas on Monday to discuss renegotiating $60 billion in foreign debt.

Some EU governments want to give former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the EU’s main envoy for Venezuela, another chance to try negotiations despite unsuccessful efforts in 2016.

But in the statement, ministers said regional elections held in Venezuela on Oct. 15 were a turning point that had hardened the bloc’s position, having taken place amid “reported numerous irregularities.”

The results appeared to favor Maduro’s ruling Socialists, while polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. In the end it won only a handful of governorships, according to the pro-government electoral board.

EU ministers will decide whom to target with sanctions at a later stage, but said they would focus on security forces and government ministers and institutions accused of human rights violations and the non-respect of democratic principles or the rule of law.

Experts say individual U.S. sanctions spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on Maduro’s policies and that oil-sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the Venezuelan government to change.","EU readies sanctions on Venezuela, approves arms embargo",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-eu/eu-readies-sanctions-on-venezuela-approves-arms-embargo-idUSKBN1DD0UN

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Trump’s repeated claims that CNN produces “fake news” and other criticisms of the network could hurt legitimate legal arguments the Department of Justice may use to show the deal gives the company too much power over media rivals and is bad for consumers.

“His comments have soiled the process,” said John Kwoka, an economics professor at Northeastern University. “If I were AT&T’s lawyers I would certainly introduce them into the evidentiary record as meddling with what is really a law enforcement process.”

The fate of AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), hatched in October 2016, looks set to end up in court as the two sides have so far failed to agree on what conditions AT&T needs to meet in order to gain antitrust approval.

Justice Department staff have recommended that AT&T sell either its DirecTV unit or Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) Turner Broadcasting unit, which includes news company CNN, a government official told Reuters on Thursday, on the grounds that a combined company would raise costs for rival entertainment distributors and stifle innovation.

AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said on Thursday he would not sell CNN to win antitrust approval and would fight the government in court if the two sides could not reach an agreement.

“If we feel like litigation is a better outcome then we will litigate,” Stephenson told the New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. He said the company had been ready to go to court the day the deal was announced in October 2016.

TRAVEL BAN COULD BE PRECEDENT

The deal took on broader political significance soon after it was announced when Trump attacked it on the campaign trail last year, vowing that as president his Justice Department would block it. He has not commented on the transaction since taking office in January.

Trump’s aggressive campaign comments have harmed legal arguments of his administration before.

Earlier this year, an appeals court refused to reinstate a ban on travelers from a group of Muslim-majority nations on the grounds that it illegally targeted people of one religion.

Explaining the decision, the chief judge cited a statement on Trump’s campaign website calling for a ”total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The U.S. Supreme Court later partially reinstated the travel ban.

OVER BY APRIL

Stephenson has rejected the Justice Department’s arguments against the deal, saying it was a classic “vertical” merger that removed no competitors from any market and denied the company would be too powerful.

He said a combined AT&T and Time Warner would create a data and advertising company competing against the newest and most disruptive entrants into the media sector: Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, not other wireless phone companies.

Stephenson told the conference he has no reason to think Trump would be a factor in the deal’s approval and said he hoped the matter would be settled well before the April 22, 2018 deadline when parties can walk away from a deal.

The head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, said in a statement late on Thursday that he has “never been instructed by the White House” on the AT&T deal.

AT&T told the Justice Department on Monday that it believed it had complied with all legal requirements for the deal to be cleared, a person briefed on the matter said. That sets a deadline for the government to sue if it wants to block the merger. Officials said that detail could be as early Nov. 27.

Biden, who will turn 75 on Nov. 20, declined to seek the Democratic nomination for last year’s presidential election in the wake of his son’s death. He told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that he was not yet ready to enter a political contest.

”I honest to God haven’t made up my mind about that,“ said Biden, who is promoting his memoir on Beau Biden, who died in 2015 from brain cancer. ”Right now I want to focus on the book and I want to focus on winning the off-year elections.

Biden served as vice president under Democratic former President Barack Obama for two terms but stood aside as the party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump last year. Biden had sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 and 2008 elections.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

“The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.

I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,” Johnson told lawmakers on Monday.

“Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,” he wrote.","LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson issued a second, fuller apology on Monday for remarks about an Iranian-British aid worker jailed in Iran that critics said might have prompted Iran to extend her prison sentence.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges.

Johnson told a parliamentary committee on Nov. 1 that she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016, contradicting her and her employer, who said she had been on holiday visiting her family.

“It was my mistake. I should have been clearer. I apologize for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family,” Johnson told lawmakers on Monday. “Our priority now is to do everything we can to get her out of Iran on humanitarian grounds.”

On Nov. 7 Johnson said in the course of an exchange with an opposition MP in parliament that “I am sorry if any words of mine have been so taken out of context and so misconstrued as to cause any kind of anxiety for the family.”

Opposition British lawmakers had said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson, whose job has come under pressure over the case, said he would meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband this week, adding that the issue was casting a shadow over relations with Iran.

“I shall travel to Iran myself later this year to review the full state of our bilateral relations and to drive home the strength of feeling in this House and in the country at large,” Johnson said.

Earlier on Monday, the government said it was considering granting diplomatic protection to Zaghari-Ratcliffe as part of an effort to secure her release from jail.

It is unclear how such protection could be offered retrospectively to a dual Iranian-British citizen, or whether such a move could help to secure her release, but a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was one option being considered.

“The prime minister has been involved with this case from the outset, she’s raised it with the Iranian president on at least two occasions, the entire government is working towards securing her release as quickly as possible,” he said.

A legal opinion prepared for the human rights charity Redress on Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case said the British government could grant her diplomatic protection as she is “predominantly” a British citizen who has been denied a fair trial.

It is unclear how Tehran would view such a step, which would explicitly make Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s fate an issue in state-to-state relations rather than a purely consular case.

BARGAINING CHIP

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s fate become a major political issue in Britain after Johnson made remarks on Nov. 1 that appeared to cast doubt on statements from her employer.

Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is seen in an undated photograph handed out by her family. Ratcliffe Family Handout via REUTERS

The Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News, said she had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran.

Iranian state television said Johnson’s comments showed Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s guilt and that she was involved in spying.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said the case had become a bargaining chip for Iran in its relations with Britain, and that it would not be helpful for Johnson to resign.

He has asked to come with Johnson on a trip to Tehran planned for later this year and called for her to be given diplomatic protection.

“Nazanin is being held because she is British and is being used as a bargaining chip against the UK, now justified by your words,” he said in an article in the Evening Standard newspaper.

“Nazanin is no longer simply a consular case as she has been endangered in a deeper way,” he wrote.

He added the uncertainty had affected his wife’s health and she had gone to hospital for tests after finding lumps on her breasts, which the specialist thought were benign and stress-related.

British ministers have rallied round Johnson but one of his allies, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, was accused of muddying the waters in a television interview on Sunday when he said he did not know what Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran.",UK's Johnson makes fuller apology for remarks on jailed aid worker in Iran,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-iran-johnson/johnson-makes-fuller-apology-for-remarks-on-jailed-aid-worker-in-iran-idUKKBN1DD132?il=0

Authorities have detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightning ascent to power.

Those held face accusations of money laundering, extortion, bribery and exploiting public office for personal gain. A Saudi anti-corruption committee has been given the power to seize companies, funds and other assets ahead of criminal inquiries.

“I can assure you there will be due process for anybody who is detained,” Al-Mouallimi told reporters at the United Nations.

When asked how many people had been detained, he said: “I do not have a figure to share with you. This is something that the security authorities will announce in due course.”

U.S. President Donald Trump has endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been “milking” Saudi Arabia for years, though the State Department has urged Riyadh to carry out prosecutions in a “fair and transparent” manner.

Human Rights Watch has also called on Saudi authorities to “immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person’s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights”.

A televisão estatal iraniana disse que mais de 407 pessoas perderam a vida no país, e ao menos 6.600 ficaram feridas. Autoridades locais disseram que o saldo de mortes aumentará à medida que as equipes de busca e resgate chegarem a áreas remotas do país.

O terremoto foi sentido em várias províncias do oeste iraniano, sendo a mais atingida Kermanshah, que anunciou três dias de luto. Mais de 300 das vítimas estavam no condado de Sarpol-e Zahab, em Kermanshah, situado a cerca de 15 quilômetros da fronteira com o Iraque.

A TV estatal iraniana disse que o tremor causou grandes danos em alguns vilarejos com casas feitas de tijolo de barro. Agentes de resgate estão trabalhando para encontrar sobreviventes sob edifícios desmoronados.

O sismo também desencadeou deslizamentos de terra que atrapalham os esforços de resgate, disseram autoridades à TV oficial. Ao menos 14 províncias do Irã foram afetadas, segundo a mídia do país.

O líder supremo do Irã, aiatolá Ali Khamenei, ofereceu seus pêsames nesta segunda-feira, exortando todas as agências do governo a fazerem tudo que puderem para ajudar os afetados.

O Instituto Geológico dos Estados Unidos disse que o terremoto teve uma magnitude de 7,3. Uma autoridade meteorológica do Iraque estimou a magnitude em 6,5, com epicentro em Penjwin, na província de Sulaimaniyah, situada na região do Curdistão e próxima da principal passagem de fronteira com o Irã.

Autoridades de saúde curdas disseram que ao menos seis pessoas morreram no Iraque e que no mínimo 68 ficaram feridas. Autoridades locais e de saúde iraquianas disseram que a área mais prejudicada foi o distrito de Darbandikham, próximo da divisa com o Irã, onde ao menos 10 casas desabaram e o único hospital foi gravemente danificado.

O tremor foi sentido até em Bagdá, no sul iraquiano, onde muitos moradores correram para fora de suas casas e prédios altos quando vibrações sacudiram a capital.

Cenas semelhantes foram vistas em Erbil, a capital do Curdistão, e em outras cidades do norte do Iraque próximas do epicentro.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Ahmad Hamza, of Libya’s National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), said that the victims were fighters opposed to government-aligned coalition forces, who had been arrested before they were killed.

Locals found the bodies near a road in the town of Alhira, 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital Tripoli, Hamza said on Sunday.

The town is in the Wershafana area, where fighting broke out last week when a coalition of forces nominally aligned with the internationally recognized government in Tripoli launched a campaign against rival armed groups, including loyalists of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

The victims’ families had not been allowed to receive the bodies for “reasons that are not known”, Hamza said.

“According to the fact-finding, monitoring and documentation section of NCHR, there are signs of torture and they (the victims) were shot in the chest and head,” he said.

The Wershafana region has been largely cut off from the capital for several years and has become notorious for violence and criminal activity.

The military council of Zintan, a town southwest of Tripoli that is participating in the campaign against rival armed groups, had said it aimed to deal with “murder, kidnapping and acts of barbarism in the region.”

There was no immediate comment from the Zintan military council after the bodies were discovered.

The recent fighting displaced about 480 families, although around 100 have since returned to their homes, according to local authorities.

Bitcoin tumbled in the second half of last week, falling as low as $5,555 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday, a slide of almost 30 percent from a record high just shy of $7,900 on Wednesday..

It rebounded on Monday, trading up more than 14 percent on the day at $6,718, though that was still more than $1,000 less than last week’s record high.

Market-watchers said the fall had been driven by a decision on Wednesday to abandon a planned software upgrade that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” - a move that had initially had a positive impact on the digital coin, sending it to a record high of $7,888 on the view that this marked a resolution of a long-term dispute.

But some were disappointed that “Segwit2x” fork had been abandoned. It would have increased the capacity of the “blocks” transactions are processed in, thereby reducing competition to get payments processed and lowering transaction fees.

Consequently, analysts said, some of those who see low fees as important to the future of bitcoin were selling it for a clone called Bitcoin Cash that spun off from the original in August. Its block sizes are larger, and therefore transaction fees are lower.

Bitcoin Cash tripled in value at the end of the week as bitcoin slid, reaching an all-time high just below $2,000 on Sunda and briefly overtaking Ethereum as the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency.

But traders bought back into the original bitcoin on Monday, sending Bitcoin Cash plummeting. It was trading down over 30 percent on the day at around $1,097, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

“Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will co-exist and serve different use cases, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s not a zero sum game,” bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antopolous said in a post on Twitter.

Bitcoin is up more than 500 percent so far this year.

Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).
He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.
“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices.","(Reuters) - General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company’s shares to a five-year low.

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

But they’re not typical Chinese deliverymen.

Bright red, gray and black, they are the robot postmen of the future, and are controlled from a command center 40 kms (25 miles) away by e-commerce giant JD.com.

The robots are among technologies revolutionizing China’s vast delivery industry, which is struggling to keep pace with 50 percent annual growth in parcel volumes amid staff shortages, tight competition and declining margins.

China’s top delivery firms such as S.F. Express, BEST Inc and ZTO Express have begun testing robots and automated sorting lines ahead of China’s Singles Day on Saturday - an annual online discount shopping extravaganza which could see 1.5 billion packages shipped around the country.

“Wages are going up and the technology cost is actually going down,” said Bao Yan, director of strategy at JD Logistics, which manages parent JD.com’s logistics network. “We own the full process... we want to have automation throughout, from the fulfillment center to transportation and for last-mile delivery.”

To be sure, the robot revolution isn’t unique to China. U.S. online retailer Amazon has staffed warehouses with thousands of robots since 2014, helping cut operating costs and delivery times.

However, Chinese industry executives say they are leapfrogging Amazon as they make use of and develop these technologies at a faster pace, with many investing proceeds from stock market listings last year.

“The adoption rate among Chinese firms is extremely fast. The economy develops so fast so everyone’s rushing to compete, to keep up,” said Johnny Chou, chairman and founder of BEST.

ROBOTS GALORE

The experiments taking place across China are wide-ranging.

BEST, and Kaola, an e-commerce unit of video games publisher NetEase Inc, are using robots that can shift goods weighing up to 1,000 kgs (1 tonne) across warehouse floors to help human packers.

Online retailers Alibaba, JD.com and S.F. Express are investing in drone programs they hope will one day perform so-called last-mile deliveries, especially in hard to reach rural areas.

Others, like ZTO Express, have rolled out automated sorting lines that can self-scan and tip parcels into bags earmarked for different destinations lined up on either side of the belt.

ZTO‘S Chief Financial Officer James Guo said automated lines, which cost about 4 million yuan ($602,419) apiece, can sort up to 25,000 parcels an hour with 40 workers, versus a manually-operated line that can sort 4,000 parcels with 120 workers. ZTO has 44 of these automated lines.

“By saving the annual salaries of 70-80 workers, I can easily get back my investment in one line,” Guo said.

Other executives said wages in the industry, which has about 3 million workers, were rising by double-digit percentages annually, outpacing China’s economic growth.

RIPPLE EFFECT

The shift is rippling down through the broader industry, logistics suppliers say, driving orders for and research into new technologies and placing new demands on warehouse landlords.

At one end of the chain are robotics and technology firms such as Qingdao Kengic Automation Equipment Co Ltd and Hikvision, which say they are partnering with logistics companies to develop new systems.

“We achieved 100 percent (revenue) growth last year,” said Xu Ke, deputy general manager of Kengic, a unit of rubber machinery maker Mesnac Co Ltd, which says its automated sorting belts are used by JD.com and online discount retailer Vipshop Holdings.

That kind of growth, he says, is attracting over a hundred new competitors into a sector that only five years ago had just a few dozen firms. “The price competition is becoming extremely harsh as everyone tries to grab market share.”

Warehouse owner Global Logistics Properties said customers who want to install robotics were asking for larger floorplates, reliable power supply and higher ceilings.

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

China’s government has been both boon and bane to the speed of the shift, other executives said.

Beijing has encouraged the fragmented logistics industry to modernize and become more efficient. The “Made in China 2025” initiative to upgrade the country’s manufacturing base has also spurred growth in robots.

But the government maintains tight control of its airspace, holding back the widespread introduction of drones, which many firms see as a potential last-mile delivery solution. Few firms have been granted drone licenses by the aviation regulator.

Still, industry executives confidently predict more parts of the supply chain will see machines replace human workers.

“We may not even need 10 years to achieve completely unmanned warehouses and unmanned distribution,” said BEST’s Chou. “Developments are happening just too quickly.”

The money is available because the country has beaten its 2017 bailout target for a primary surplus - which excludes debt servicing costs - of 1.75 percent of gross economic output, he said.

Tsipras came to power in 2015 promising to end austerity but was later forced to sign up to a new EU bailout, the country’s third, in exchange for more belt-tightening to keep Greece in the euro zone. He was re-elected and his term ends in late 2019.

His leftist-led government hopes that after seven years of crisis, Greece’s fiscal performance will help it emerge from EU bailouts in August 2018, when its current rescue package ends.

“For a second year, we are in a position to distribute a social dividend to the people who need it the most. Better prepared and more effective this year, we will be able to pay out an even bigger amount,” he said in a televised statement.

Last year, Tsipras unexpectedly announced that the state would pay out about 600 million euros to low-income pensioners, a move that angered the country’s international lenders.

This year’s handouts have been approved in principle by the lenders, who are reviewing Greece’s bailout progress. Their representatives are expected in Athens this month to resume talks on fiscal targets and on reforms.

The 26-year-old, finally beginning to consistently deliver on his huge potential, edged the so-called “battle of the backhands” after a compelling two hours 21 minutes.

Dimitrov, the first Bulgarian to qualify for the tournament in its 48-year-old history, overcame some late jitters to prevail in the opening Pete Sampras Group match.

The world number six served for the match at 5-4 in the decider but was broken to love before two consecutive double faults by Thiem gave him another chance to close it out.

Again Dimitrov wobbled, squandering two match points at 40-15 with a double-fault and a tight forehand error, but he finally bagged the win when Thiem looped a backhand long.

“The first time I got broken (at 5-4) I thought ‘okay let’s get back up and try again’,” Dimitrov, who enjoyed some noisy support from a contingent of Bulgarian fans, said on court.

Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).
He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.
“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices.","(Reuters) - General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company’s shares to a five-year low.

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

Juan Ángel Napout, formerly president of the South American soccer governing body CONMEBOL and Paraguay’s soccer federation, Manuel Burga, former president of Peru’s soccer federation and José Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil’s soccer federation are on trial in federal court in Brooklyn.

The three men are the first to stand trial since U.S. prosecutors unveiled a corruption case against soccer officials around the world more than two years ago. Of 42 people charged by U.S. prosecutors in the FIFA probe, 24 have pleaded guilty and two have been sentenced so far.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Edelman told jurors that the three men were part of a conspiracy to take bribes from sports marketing companies in exchange for lucrative marketing rights to soccer tournaments, including the Copa America and Copa Libertadores.

“The defendants cheated the sport in order to line their pockets with money that should have been spent to benefit the game, not themselves,” Edelman said. The money they pocketed could have been spent by soccer organizations to build fields, buy equipment and fund women’s teams and youth leagues, he said.

None of the lawyers for the former officials denied that there was corruption in international soccer, but all told jurors that their clients had not taken part.

“This case is not about FIFA,” said Napout’s lawyer, Silvia Pinera. “It’s about one man, Juan Angel Napout, and his fight for justice.”

Slideshow (4 Images)

Pinera told jurors that the case against Napout would rely on testimony from Alejandro Burzaco, the former head of sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias. Burzaco, she said, “cut a sweetheart deal with the government and began telling stories” after he was indicted.

Burga’s lawyer, Bruce Udolf, also said he expected prosecutors to rely on cooperating witnesses who might be motivated to “get pretty doggone creative” to avoid prison.

Marin’s lawyer, Charles Stillman, likened corruption in international soccer to a children’s soccer game in which Marin did not participate.

Weyburn, to be sold to the western Canadian energy company Whitecap Resources Inc (WCP.TO), is the last of four main assets for which Cenovus has reached agreements to sell to pay down debt incurred in the C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips (COP.N) assets this year.

Hariri, who threw Lebanon into political crisis by reading out his resignation on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, gave his first public remarks since then in an interview late on Sunday, saying he planned to return within days.

He suggested he could even withdraw his resignation, provided the Shi‘ite group Hezbollah -- allied to Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran -- renounces interference in conflicts across the Middle East.

The crisis has thrust tiny Lebanon -- where Sunni, Shi‘ite, Christian and Druze groups with backing from regional powers fought a 1975-1990 civil war -- to the forefront of the rivalry between Riyadh and Tehran being played out on battlefields from Syria to Yemen.

Aoun has said he believes Hariri does not have free control over his own movements while in Saudi Arabia, and that this casts doubt on any statements Hariri makes. Nevertheless those close to Aoun said the president welcomed Hariri’s comments.

“President Aoun expressed his pleasure at Hariri’s announcement of his return to Lebanon soon,” a source said.

Aoun said that Hariri was “leaving all doors open including rescinding his resignation”, according to one of a group of visitors who met Aoun. The visitors declined to be identified while discussing the closed-door conversations.

The visitors quoted Aoun as saying that Hariri’s remarks showed that the political deal underpinning Lebanon’s coalition government -- which includes both Hariri’s Sunni party and the heavily armed Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah -- still stands.

Aoun has been convening high level meetings with Lebanese politicians and diplomats since Hariri stepped down, and the visitors said the president believed that Hariri’s comments showed such efforts were working.

SILENCE FROM HEZBOLLAH

Nearly 24 hours after Hariri’s interview, which appeared on a TV station he owns, Hezbollah had still not commented on his remarks. Hezbollah’s allies in Iran said Hariri’s remarks gave hope he would return to Lebanon.

In his resignation speech Hariri, whose father, also a former prime minister, was killed by a bomb in 2005, said he feared assassination. He said in his interview eight days later that he was free to leave Saudi Arabia but that his movements were also guided by concern for his family’s safety.

Hariri’s Future Movement political party said on Monday it saw his plan to return to Beirut within days as a “good sign” and a step on the road to repairing Lebanon’s foreign relations.

In a televised statement, Future Movement lawmaker Ammar Houri said it supported Hariri’s statement that Lebanon should stay out of regional conflicts and reject Iran’s interference.

Saudi Arabia denies that it coerced Hariri into resigning or has kept him from leaving. It has accused Lebanon of declaring war on it because of Hezbollah, and has advised Saudi citizens to leave Lebanon. Hezbollah says it was the Saudis who have declared war on Lebanon.

The world’s largest retailer will start offering higher-end clothing and accessories from Lord & Taylor to its customers in spring 2018.

The partnership will allow Lord & Taylor to open a virtual storefront on Walmart.com and boost customer traffic to its website by reaching a wider audience. It will boost Wal-Mart’s online assortment with premium products and advance the retailer’s effort to access millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com.

“Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination within Walmart.com,” Denise Incandela, Head of Fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce told Reuters in an interview on Monday. She said Wal-Mart shoppers search the retailer’s website for premium items and the company aims to expand its online business with a focus on such products.

“This is a part of a larger business strategy where we are working to create a new Walmart.com,” Incandela said. She did not comment on the financial terms of the partnership.

In the past year, Wal-Mart has been acquiring small online fashion brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos in an attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon and others in the online fashion world.

Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales for that category exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.

But despite its store muscle, Wal-Mart has failed to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but due to its low-income customer base and brand perception, has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.

Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.

Virtual storefronts have become a strong e-commerce tool with retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) routinely offering dedicated space to brands on their website.

Virtual stores are also a preferred route for U.S. retailers to enter new countries where they don’t have operations. For example, Macy’s in 2015 said it would enter China with a virtual store on Alibaba and test demand in that market.",Wal-Mart partners with Lord & Taylor to expand online fashion presence,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1DD2Q7-OCABS

The DA walked out of a parliamentary session addressed by Zuma on Nov. 2 in protest over the potential cost to the public purse of his legal fees. Zuma had failed to answer a question about how much had been spent since May 1, 2009 to defend 783 corruption charges against him that were dropped by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) before he ran for the presidency.

“By avoiding the question, the DA believes that both the President, and the Deputy Speaker, Lechesa Tsenoli, presiding at the time who allowed President Zuma to avoid the question, acted unlawfully and unconstitutionally,” Selfe said.

“Given that the taxpayer has most likely footed the bill for the President’s legal costs, the full amount spent should be revealed, in the public interest.”

Jun’s appearance comes toward the end of a year in which South Korea’s entertainment industry suffered a drop in Chinese demand for South Korean cultural exports. The drop came as Beijing objected to Seoul’s use of a U.S. anti-missile system, prompting popular anti-South Korean sentiment in China.

South Korean celebrities soon reported being unable to attend promotional events and having work visa applications delayed, officials at South Korean talent agencies told Reuters.

“Chinese TV ads featuring South Korean celebrities were suddenly dropped and new ones aired with Chinese celebrities,” said a director of a South Korean talent agency, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, at a regular briefing on Monday, said he was not aware of any restrictions on South Korean cultural exports, and that “China will work hard with South Korea to promote the early return to the correct and healthy track of bilateral exchanges and cooperation.”

Mentholatum’s Asia-Pacific headquarters did not have an immediate comment. Alibaba could not be immediately reached.

In late October, Beijing and Seoul agreed to move beyond their year-long stand-off over the missile issue.

“We haven’t seen any immediate tangible change, but we hope the agreement will have a positive impact on future cultural exchange,” South Korean entertainment and media firm CJ E&M Corp told Reuters.

The impact of the stand-off has been deep. K-Pop agency YG Entertainment Inc has not scheduled any concerts in China since July 2016. In its most recent earnings report, it said July-September operating profit fell 88 percent.

Peer S.M. Entertainment Co has also not scheduled a concert in China since September 2016. Its latest earnings showed a 61 percent profit drop for January-June.

But analysts expect the agreement ending the stand-off to see earnings at entertainment firms begin to recover from as soon as early 2018.

Reflecting that expectation, shares of CJ E&M rose 5.6 percent on Monday, while S.M. was up 3.9 percent and YG was 6.1 percent higher.

President Nicolas Maduro confused investors this month with a vow to continue paying Venezuela’s crippling debt, while also seeking to restructure and refinance it.

Both restructuring and refinancing appear out of the question, however, due to U.S. sanctions against the crisis-stricken nation. A default would compound Venezuela’s dire economic crisis.

Monday’s short and confused meeting, attended by senior Venezuelan officials blacklisted by the United States, gave no clarity on how Maduro would carry out his plan, bondholders and their representatives who participated said afterwards.

That means Venezuela remains with the dilemma of whether to continuing paying debt at the expense of an increasingly hungry and sick population, or defaulting on creditors and burning its bridges to the global financial system.

But bond prices maintained last week’s rally, with one investor saying there was relief the meeting did not include a default announcement.

“There was no offer, no terms, no strategy, nothing,” said one bondholder, leaving the meeting that lasted a little over half an hour at the ‘White Palace’, opposite Maduro’s office in downtown Caracas.

“It was a missed opportunity,” said another participant, also departing with a colorful gift-bag made out of recycled materials and containing Venezuelan chocolates and coffee.

The investors had entered via a red carpet and were greeted by a poster of Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez at the entrance of the meeting room inside, witnesses said.

About 100 investors, including some bondholders from New York, and lawyers representing creditors, had arrived.

Chief debt negotiators Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Economy Minister Simon Zerpa - on U.S. sanctions lists for drug and corruption charges respectively - attended for half an hour.

They met with some bondholders, while others stayed out of the room, witnesses said, as they were concerned about the consequences of meeting them. The U.S. has warned bondholders that they could face stiff penalties if they deal with sanctioned officials.

Participants said El Aissami gave a statement protesting unfair treatment by global financial institutions, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s sanctions aimed at preventing Venezuela from issuing new debt.

El Aissami described U.S. financial authorities as “worse than the Holy Inquisition,” one attendee said.

He also told creditors that Deutsche Bank may soon cut off some financial services to Venezuela, participants said.

Deutsche declined to comment.

Separately, the European Union approved economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Venezuela on Monday, although it has yet to name who will be subject to the sanctions.

HUNTING FOOD IN GARBAGE

Slideshow (9 Images)

Markets continue to remain optimistic that Venezuela will service its debts, noting it continues to make payments despite delays caused by increased bank vigilance.

It has made close to $2 billion in payments in the past two weeks, albeit delayed.

Bond prices were up across the board on Monday, with the benchmark 2022 notes issued by state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] rising 3.25 percentage points.

But some investors fear Maduro’s promise to restructure and refinance debt rings hollow, and that his government may in fact be paving the way for a default.

The economic implosion has already taken a brutal toll on Venezuelans. Citizens are increasingly suffering from malnutrition and preventable diseases because they cannot find food and medicine or cannot afford them because of triple-digit inflation.

The sight of poor Venezuelans eating from garbage bags has become a powerful symbol of decay. It contrasts sharply with the era of Chavez, when high oil prices helped fuel state spending.

Halting debt service would free up an additional $1.6 billion in hard currency by the end of the year. Those resources could be used to improve supplies of staple goods as Maduro heads into a presidential election expected for 2018.

But the strategy could backfire if met with aggressive lawsuits. A default by PDVSA, which issued about half of the country’s outstanding bonds, could ensnare the company’s foreign assets such as refineries in legal battles - potentially crimping export revenue.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

“Es war für uns wichtig, dass wir Europäer uns eigenständig aufstellen - gerade nach der Wahl des US- Präsidenten”, sagte Verteidigungsministerin Ursula von der Leyen anlässlich der Gründung des neuen Pakts am Montag in Brüssel. Das Bündnis solle die Nato nicht ersetzen, sondern diese ergänzen. Doch sei gleichzeitig klar: “Niemand wird unsere Sicherheitsprobleme für uns lösen, sondern wir müssen es selbst tun.”

Im Rahmen des “Pesco” (Permanent Structured Cooperation)genannten Clubs wollen die EU-Staaten ihre Militärkooperation vertiefen, von der schnellen Verlegung von Truppen innerhalb des Kontinents bis zum gemeinsamen Einkauf von Ausrüstung. Doch sei das Potenzial damit längst nicht ausgeschöpft, sagte von der Leyen. “Es ist ein Schritt in Richtung einer Armee der Europäer.”

Der Pesco-Vertrag wurde am Montag von 23 Staaten unterzeichnet. Dabei sind alle EU-Mitglieder bis auf Portugal, Malta, Dänemark, Irland und Großbritannien. Großbritannien wurde durch das Brexit-Votum unfreiwillig sogar Geburtshelfer der neuen Kooperation. Vorherige Versuche für eine engere Militärkooperation auf EU-Ebene hatte London seit Jahrzehnten blockiert. Nun haben die Spitzenpolitiker in den anderen Hauptstädten freie Bahn. Gleichzeitig trägt Pesco der neuen militärischen Realität Rechnung, da die EU mit dem Abschied des Königreichs 2019 eine der schlagkräftigsten Armeen verliert.

GABRIEL SETZT AUF EINSPARUNGEN

Einer der großen Treiber hinter dem Militärclub sind die jüngsten Krisen vor Europas Haustür, bei denen die EU auch nach Einschätzung aus den eigenen Reihen kein gutes Bild abgab. Beim Zusammenbruch Libyens 2011 mussten die europäischen Nato-Mitglieder die USA um Unterstützung bitten. Zugleich wuchs in den EU-Hauptstädten seit der Besetzung der ukrainischen Krim die Furcht vor Russland. “Die Vereinbarung kommt zu einer Zeit mit deutlichen Spannung”, sagte der französische Außenminister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Rückendeckung bekommt der Club durch einen fünf Milliarden Euro schweren Verteidigungs-Fonds für den Kauf von Waffen. Doch gibt es auch Pflichten: Die Mitgliedsländer müssen beispielsweise regelmäßig ihre Militärplanung vorlegen, damit diese von einer zentralen Stelle geprüft werden kann. Die Nato stellt sich hinter das EU-Projekt.

Zurück geht die Pesco-Idee auf eine deutsch-französische Initiative. Ursprünglich suchte Paris wegen der zahlreichen Auslandseinsätze militärische Unterstützung und wollte nur wenige Länder beteiligen. Auf Druck von Deutschland wurde der Verein jedoch für alle EU-Mitglieder geöffnet.

Bundesaußenminister Sigmar Gabriel sieht noch einen weiteren Vorteil: “Die europäische Zusammenarbeit in Verteidigungsfragen wird Geld sparen.” Problem sei derzeit in Europa, dass in der Sicherheit viele Länder das Gleiche machten und sich zu wenig koordinierten. Die europäischen Militärausgaben lägen bei 50 Prozent der USA, doch erzielten sie nur 15 Prozent der Wirkung.",Europäer besiegeln engere militärische Zusammenarbeit,https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-verteidigung-idDEKBN1DD1XO

The man accused of tackling Paul and breaking his ribs, Rene Boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said.

Boucher is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30.

Credit Suisse traders improperly shared information to manipulate currency prices and benchmark rates, and took advantage of its electronic trading platform to trade ahead of known client orders, the New York State Department of Financial Services said.

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank engaged in “unsound conduct” from at least 2008 to 2015 by failing to control its foreign exchange business, the regulator said.

Credit Suisse said it was “pleased to have reached a settlement with the DFS that allows the bank to put this matter behind it,” and said it did not admit to any findings.

The agreement is the latest in a string of global regulatory settlements with big Wall Street banks over forex trading practices.

Rivals including Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays PLC (BARC.L), and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS.L) collectively paid $10 billion in 2014 and 2015 to settle probes by U.S. and European authorities that their forex traders coordinated to cheat clients and boost their own profits.

Since 2014, New York has been investigating whether banks under its aegis used algorithms on their trading platforms to front-run or otherwise manipulate foreign exchange rates.

Credit Suisse, like numerous other foreign banks, operates in the United States through foreign branches that are licensed and regulated by New York state.

Earlier this year, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay New York $350 million to settle similar claims, and Barclays paid $635 million in 2015.

The probe is still ongoing in relation to other banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In a statement, DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo blamed Credit Suisse’s conduct on executives who “deliberately fostered a corrupt culture that failed to implement effective controls.”

As part of its settlement, Credit Suisse agreed to improve its controls and compliance, and retain a consultant to review its remedial efforts for at least a year.

Like other banks, Credit Suisse foreign exchange traders used chat rooms to share confidential customer information, coordinate trades and try to manipulate currencies or benchmark rates, DFS said.

Through these communications, the traders were able to trade ahead of clients, or use a tactic called “building ammo,” with which they coordinated activity with other traders to ensure they were not taking positions that would hurt one another, the regulator said.",NY state regulator fines Credit Suisse $135 mln over forex practices,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-gp-forex-settlement/ny-state-regulator-fines-credit-suisse-135-mln-over-forex-practices-idUSKBN1DD2AY?il=0

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.","ANKARA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Thousands of homeless Iranians huddled against the cold late on Monday, a day after at least 450 people were killed in Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade, state TV said.

Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.

Iran’s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.

The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.

Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.

At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000.

Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children’s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.

ANGRY PEOPLE

Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.

“We need a shelter,” a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. “Where is the aid? Where is the help?” His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.

An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake’s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq’s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran.

Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded.

Iraq’s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district’s only hospital was severely damaged.

“The situation there is very critical,” Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters.

The district’s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.

The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.

“I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.

“I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: ‘Earthquake!'”

An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.

“I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,” a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.

Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah’s main hospital had been badly damaged.

NO SHELTER

Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people.

Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.

Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.

Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said.

Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.

“My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,” Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.

Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.

A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.

“The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,” Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.","Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-quake/strong-earthquake-hits-iraq-and-iran-killing-more-than-450-idUSKBN1DC0VZ

Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate were debating their respective plans this week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Republicans are aiming to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand Trump his first major legislative victory. The two chambers hope to resolve their differences in time to enact the legislation by the end of the year.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post.

Trump has repeatedly pushed for the tax reform bill to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Neither House nor Senate proposals include such a provision.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

Republican tax plans in the House and Senate would each add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, but lawmakers will have to iron out differences including the treatment of the deduction for state and local taxes, when to start a cut in the corporate tax rate and whether to scrap the estate tax on inheritances.

The House is expected to pass its tax bill this week, while the Senate debates its proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate hoped to have its version ready to be considered the week after Thanksgiving.

The two plans have some different details but are “similar conceptually,” McConnell said in his home state of Kentucky.

Senators began tweaking their proposal on Monday. An amendment introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch would remove the provision that currently lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

The prospects for the provisions Trump pushed were uncertain.

The Senate proposal calls for keeping seven tax brackets but cutting rates, including the top tax rate for the highest earning taxpayers, to 38.5 percent from 39.6 percent. The House wants to reduce the number of brackets, but leave the 39.6 percent top rate alone.

The Congressional Budget Office said last week that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than it originally forecasted.

Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying.

The Trump administration is trying to drum up support for the tax reform effort in U.S. towns and cities as well as on Capitol Hill.

The British Prime Minister faces growing challenges to her leadership from her Conservative party’s pro- and anti-European Union factions. Political disarray increases the risks that quitting the bloc will inflict serious harm on the economy. A softer Brexit is becoming harder to deliver.

Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in London, Britain November 9, 2017

A clear sign that investors are getting more nervous came on Monday when sterling shed a full cent against the U.S. dollar, falling below $1.31. The trigger was a Sunday Times report that 40 Conservative deputies had agreed to sign a letter of no confidence in May – eight short of the number needed to trigger a leadership contest. A sharp jump in options prices that reflect how much traders expect the pound to gyrate against the dollar in the next month underscores the market jitters.

Fair enough. May is struggling to convince other EU countries that Britain has made enough compromises on Brexit issues they want resolved before moving on to discussing trade. Ejecting her would require the Conservatives to spend weeks choosing a new leader. A general election might have to be called to confirm her replacement’s mandate, possibly leading to a change of government. This would delay negotiations about trading arrangements to allow continued tariff-free movement of goods between Britain and the rest of the EU. It would also make it harder to secure a transition period that would delay the impact of the new arrangements beyond the March 2019 Brexit date.

The longer the clock ticks without tangible progress on trading terms and conditions, the more likely businesses are to move jobs and investment out of the United Kingdom. Investors’ patience will run out even sooner. They have so far assumed that the prime concern of British politicians is to minimise economic damage: the Breakingviews Brexit indicator, which incorporates signals from currency, bond, stock, and credit default swap prices, has been relatively stable in recent months.

The bill would exempt banks with less than $250 billion in assets - including BB&T, SunTrust Banks and American Express - from heightened regulatory scrutiny, in a move that could redraw the domestic U.S. banking landscape by reducing costs and unleashing a wave of mergers and acquisitions activity.

The House of Representatives has already passed a broad rewrite of the Dodd-Frank law, but Senate agreement is necessary before the Republican-led Congress can approve easing the rules for the banks.

Industry expectations on a final deal had been muted because Senate Republicans need eight Democrats to support their efforts in order to pass changes to the post-crisis rules. The Senate bill, which is more limited in scope than the House’s original proposal, has nine Democratic co-sponsors, meaning it is likely to pass into law.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo struck the deal with a group of moderate Democratic senators including Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, Jon Tester and Mark Warner, who took over the discussions with Crapo after the committee’s ranking Democrat, Sherrod Brown, walked away from the talks last week.

“The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks,” Crapo said in a statement.

The move has been strongly opposed by consumer advocacy groups such as Americans for Financial Reform and some powerful Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who argue it will increase risks to the system, potentially hurting consumers.

“I understand my colleagues’ interest in agreeing to this legislation, but disagree on the wisdom of rolling back so many of Dodd-Frank’s protections with almost no gains for working families,” Brown said in a statement.

The KBW Regional Banking Index turned positive around midday and was last up about 1.4 percent after steadily climbing in afternoon trading.

RAISING THE THRESHOLD

Central to the bipartisan discussions has been the asset threshold at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions or “SIFIs,” subjecting them to much stricter oversight including higher capital buffers.

That threshold starts at $50 billion, but Monday’s bill would raise it to $250 billion, releasing more than a dozen banks from the stricter rules, according to an analysis by the government’s Office of Financial Research.

Banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would

be exempt once the bill is enacted, while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would be exempted 18 months later.

The bill would give the Federal Reserve discretion to release banks in the second bracket from the SIFI designation prior to the 18-month deadline if it sees fit, and to reinstate them as SIFIs afterward, subject to certain conditions still being drawn up.

Raising the threshold would not only reduce costs for many banks but allow those that have hovered beneath the $50 billion threshold to do deals and expand their balance sheets without fear of being caught by stricter oversight.",Senate reaches preliminary deal on easing bank rules,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-banks/senate-reaches-preliminary-deal-on-easing-bank-rules-idUKKBN1DD2A5

Josh Hawley, a Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill in next year’s elections, announced at a press conference that he issued an investigative subpoena to Google. He expressed concern over the accuracy of the company’s privacy policy, allegations it misappropriated content from rivals and claims it demoted competitors’ websites in search results.

Google said it had not yet received the subpoena.

“However, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment,” spokesperson Andrea Faville said in a statement.

Google has come under growing scrutiny globally as it has become a top provider of online search, mobile software and advertising technology. But formal investigations have reached varying results in the last seven years.

Attorney generals of 37 states reached a $7 million settlement in 2013 over Google’s unauthorized collection of Wi-Fi data through its Street View digital-mapping cars. A Federal Trade Commission inquiry also prompted Google that year to agree to provide advertisers and patent licensees more flexible terms.

The FTC, though, did not bring the stronger antitrust charges that Google rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Yelp Inc sought. States including Ohio, Mississippi and Texas saw inquiries falter without substantive consequences.

Missouri’s Hawley said the FTC’s inaction created an opening.

“We are going to act to hold corporate giants accountable ... for the good of the people of Missouri,” Hawley said.

Asked at the press conference whether his senate candidacy played a role in opening the Google inquiry, Hawley said he acted upon his oath of office and desire “to get to the truth.”

He pointed to the European Union fining Google $2.7 billion in June for unfairly favoring links to its own shopping service over those from other e-commerce websites. Hawley said he was moved to act because of concern that Google is engaging in similar behavior domestically. Google is appealing the EU fine.

The other issue cited by Hawley may be tied to complaints from Yelp. The business reviews’ website wrote the FTC and the attorney generals of all 50 states in September that Google has copied images from its service without permission in violation of a commitment made to the U.S. antitrust regulator.",Google faces antitrust investigation in Missouri,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-antitrust/google-faces-antitrust-investigation-in-missouri-idUSKBN1DD2CE

Saudi Arabia backs a grouping of opposition figures called the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) led by Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister under Assad. The HNC has represented the Syrian opposition at previous Geneva talks.

A number of other political opposition groups and figures backed by other countries including Russia and Egypt also exist.

It was not clear from SPA’s statement which Syrian opposition members would participate in the conference.

The kingdom, a leading backer of Syrian rebels, supports an international agreement on the future of Syria but maintains that President Bashar al-Assad should have no role in any transition to bring the war there to an end.

Assad, whose Syrian army forces have been backed by Saudi arch-foes Iran and Hezbollah, has made major gains against opposition forces and Islamic State militants.

“Based on the policy of the Kingdom in support of the efforts to establish peace and counter terrorism, and in response to the request of the Syrian opposition, an expanded meeting will be held in the city of Riyadh,” SPA said.

Talks set for November 22-24 aim “to bring its parties and platforms closer together and unite its negotiating delegation to resume direct negotiations in Geneva under the auspices of the U.N.”

Several rounds of U.N. talks in Geneva between the Damascus government and the opposition have made little progress.","Saudi Arabia to host ""expanded"" Syrian opposition conference",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DD2DI-OCATP

U.S. District Judge William Walls sent the jurors home for the day and told them to resume their deliberations on Tuesday, Steven Sandberg, a representative for Menendez, said in an email.

A representative for the court clerk’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Menendez is on trial on charges that he accepted private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors between 2006 and 2013.

Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship.

If Menendez is convicted, Republicans will be presented with a chance to gain a seat in the closely divided U.S. Senate, as his replacement would be named by Republican Governor Chris Christie. Christie will remain in office until Jan. 16, when Democratic governor-elect Phil Murphy will take his place.

The jury, beginning its first day of deliberations with a new member after another panelist was allowed to leave for a previously scheduled vacation, sent the judge a note on Monday afternoon saying they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict on any of the counts, the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper reported.

“Is there any additional guidance and what do we do now?” the jury asked the judge in their note, according to the newspaper.

The judge then heard from attorneys from both the prosecution, who argued that the jury had only begun their deliberations again three hours earlier that day, and Menendez’s attorney, who argued for the judge to declare a mistrial, the Star-Ledger said.

Walls concluded that it would be appropriate for the jury to continue their deliberations.

The money is available because the country has beaten its 2017 bailout target for a primary surplus - which excludes debt servicing costs - of 1.75 percent of gross economic output, he said.

Tsipras came to power in 2015 promising to end austerity but was later forced to sign up to a new EU bailout, the country’s third, in exchange for more belt-tightening to keep Greece in the euro zone. He was re-elected and his term ends in late 2019.

His leftist-led government hopes that after seven years of crisis, Greece’s fiscal performance will help it emerge from EU bailouts in August 2018, when its current rescue package ends.

“For a second year, we are in a position to distribute a social dividend to the people who need it the most. Better prepared and more effective this year, we will be able to pay out an even bigger amount,” he said in a televised statement.

Last year, Tsipras unexpectedly announced that the state would pay out about 600 million euros to low-income pensioners, a move that angered the country’s international lenders.

This year’s handouts have been approved in principle by the lenders, who are reviewing Greece’s bailout progress. Their representatives are expected in Athens this month to resume talks on fiscal targets and on reforms.

“We (the institutions) have been discussing these ideas with the Greek authorities. The announcements seem broadly in line with these discussions, which have not been concluded yet,” an EU Commission spokesman said, adding that the proposals would be examined by the lenders.

Tsipras said about 720 million euros would be distributed by mid-December to 3.4 million Greeks as a one-off, tax-free benefit, based on income and wealth criteria and household size. The country’s population is about 11 million.

Another 315 million euros would be directed to pensioners, he said, to compensate them for “unfair” health contribution payments in 2012-2016, while 360 million euros would be paid to Greece’s biggest power utility, Public Power Corporation (DEHr.AT), to prevent electricity tariff increases.",Greece to distribute 1.4 billion euros to citizens hit by austerity,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-pm/greece-to-distribute-1-4-billion-euros-to-citizens-hit-by-austerity-idUSKBN1DD2BO?il=0

>> So what we saw with Airbnb is that they really came in with this brand new model of offering these vacation rental homes. Wherein rather than buying a room in a crowded hotel, you get an apartment, you get a house, all to yourself, to your friends, right somewhere nice in the middle of the city.

Now Airbnb been extremely successful with this model. Whenever you speak with someone about getting a vacation rental home, Airbnb has now become kinda the short hand for these vacation rentals.>> Priceline warning the growth rate for nights booked and total bookings for the holiday-heavy first quarter could be as much as half rate than three months before.

TripAdvisor reeling from the company's biggest ever stock market plunge after forecasting flat sales growth. And Expedia, the conglomerate behind Orbitz, Travelocity, Trivago, and HomeAway, its answer to Airbnb, also predicting slower demand. Airbnb, however, is not the group's only problem.>> Now we're seeing a shift back to what has previous been the norm.","Online travel sites getting deserted for Airbnb, hotel chains",https://www.reuters.tv/v/ptM/2017/11/13/online-travel-sites-getting-deserted-for-airbnb-hotel-chains

“We’ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,” Trump told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of Southeast Asian and East Asian nations.

He did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam before his last leg in the Philippines capital.

He said a statement would be issued from the White House on Wednesday about North Korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful.

“It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen,” he said.

In Vietnam at the weekend, Trump and leaders of Pacific Rim nations agreed to address “unfair trade practices” and “market- distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape.

His “America First” vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that China now champions. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when Trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting American jobs.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told the summit in Vietnam that Asia-Pacific nations must “uphold multilateralism”, countering Trump’s message that the United States would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty.

Trump, by contrast, blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour.

Sculpted after artist Duane Hanson’s son, the lifelike artwork, titled “Baby in a Carriage, 1983,” is valued at about $80,000 to $120,000, according to director of American art at Heritage Auctions in Manhattan.

“It’s the greatest. If you could watch our footage of this baby in the window, it would crack you up because truly all day, people, women, children, mothers, grandfathers, cops will stop and look at it and wonder truly for a second, or more than a second, is that really a baby?”, Director of American art at Heritage Auctions, Aviva Lehmann, told Reuters, adding that this “is exactly what Hanson wanted you to think.”

The polyvinyl piece of a sleeping toddler wearing a lightlue sweatshirt and matching sweatpants, is topped off with a head of blonde human hair, furthering its authenticity.

“That’s art?” a stunned Rachel Leeds said with a laugh. “I thought that was a real baby.”

The baby’s shirt carries the bible verse, ”He that is without sin among you, let him first cast the first stone,” from the Gospel of John 8:7.

Hanson, a Minnesota native, is often depicted as a “hyper realist” artist.

“He’s been grouped with the pop artists, but he’s just all about capturing middle America, whether it’s a cop or a security guard or a tourist sitting on a bench in the sun,” Lehmann said.

As the afternoon wound down, the scuplture continued to confuse midtown Manhattan.

“I passed by it a few minutes ago on my way to a store and then on my way back I took a better look at it,” said onlooker Sarah Conforti as she snapped a photo of the sculpture. “The baby doesn’t look very happy.”

Passerby Rahmel Dantzler expressed having a similar reaction to the sculpture.

O atraso de mais de dois meses, dentro do chamado Convênio de Créditos Recíprocos, uma câmara de compensação entre países da América do Sul, já é considerado um calote pelo governo brasileiro. Uma carta foi enviada à embaixada venezuelana no Brasil avisando da possibilidade de o país levar o caso ao Clube de Paris, ao qual aderiu formalmente em 2016.

O papel do Clube é justamente tratar da dívida dos países. “O Brasil pretende usar essa estrutura para tratar da cobrança”, disse uma das fontes.

Apesar do valor não ser alto, o fato de a Venezuela não ter conseguido honrar suas dívidas dentro do mecanismo de compensação é um péssimo sinal para o governo de Nicolás Maduro.

No CCR, a compensação é multilateral. Países que têm a pagar fazem os depósitos e as retiradas duas a três vezes por ano. O CCR é uma garantia de pagamento, já que aquilo que um país tem a receber é depositado e usado para pagar as dívidas com os demais.

Em informação enviada à Reuters por e-mail, o Brasil deveria ter recebido 334,50 milhões de dólares. “Tais valores eram compostos pela soma dos saldos bilaterais do Brasil perante todos os demais países da CCR. Tendo em conta o ocorrido com a Venezuela, os valores a serem recebidos pelo Brasil foram recalculados”, explicou o BC.

No final, o Brasil recebeu apenas 72 milhões de dólares, dos demais países.

Por ser teoricamente uma garantia de pagamento, o CCR ainda permitia a Venezuela comprar produtos, especialmente alimentos e medicamentos, dos países vizinhos. O não pagamento pelo CCR pode piorar ainda mais a situação venezuelana, que já não tem crédito direto em nenhum país.

Cálculos feitos pelo governo brasileiro e por empresas apontam para uma dívida de 5 bilhões de dólares entre o governo Maduro e empresas brasileiras. A situação perdura há mais de dois anos, sem solução, e empresas brasileiras só têm aceitado exportar para a Venezuela com pagamento adiantado.

No primeiro semestre deste ano, o governo brasileiro anunciou que tentaria enviar uma missão de negociação a Caracas para tratar das dívidas, mas até hoje não teve sucesso.","Venezuela deixa de pagar dívida de US$262,5 mi e Brasil deve ir a Clube de Paris",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idBRKBN1DD2R2-OBRWD

Le chef de l‘Etat a observé une minute de silence et déposé une gerbe de fleurs sur les lieux des attaques, du Stade de France (Seine-Saint-Denis) au Bataclan, en passant par les cafés et restaurants de l‘Est parisien visés deux ans plus tôt.

Lors de ces étapes, les noms des 130 morts ont été lus à haute voix.

Muet, parfois les larmes aux yeux, Emmanuel Macron a ensuite participé à un lâcher de ballons devant la mairie du XIe arrondissement, près de sites attaqués.

Son prédécesseur François Hollande, la maire de Paris, Anne Hidalgo, l‘ex-Premier ministre Manuel Valls, l‘ex-ministre de l‘Intérieur Bernard Cazeneuve et d‘autres personnalités ont participé aux hommages, sans prendre la parole.

“Il est important de sans cesse entretenir l‘idée qu‘on doit résister à la peur”, a déclaré le député de La France insoumise Jean-Luc Mélenchon, venu déposer une gerbe de fleurs devant le Bataclan lors d‘une cérémonie distincte.

MENACE TOUJOURS “ÉLEVÉE”

Le 13 novembre 2015 au soir, trois kamikazes ont fait exploser leur ceinture d‘explosifs aux abords du Stade de France, durant un match des Bleus, et deux groupes d‘assaillants ont pris pour cible le Bataclan, une salle de spectacle où 90 personnes ont été tuées, et plusieurs établissements situés non loin de là.

Dix mois après les attentats contre Charlie Hebdo et un commerce de produits cashers, ces attaques planifiées par le groupe Etat islamique (EI) ont durablement modifié le climat en France, restée sous état d‘urgence jusqu‘au 1er novembre.

“On peut (...) regarder le pays en se disant qu‘il a tenu, qu‘il a su trouver des réponses juridiques, militaires à certains égards, mais aussi une forme d‘attachement à ce qu‘il est, d‘attachement résolu à une façon d‘être, une façon de vivre qui ne veut pas être remise en cause”, a déclaré le Premier ministre, Edouard Philippe, sur France Inter.

“Je constate que la France est toujours la France”, a-t-il ajouté.

Théâtre d‘attentats meurtriers le 14 juillet 2016 à Nice et le 1er octobre dernier gare Saint-Charles à Marseille, notamment, le pays reste confronté à une menace essentiellement interne qui a conduit les autorités à adopter le mois dernier une nouvelle loi antiterroriste.

“Le niveau de menace reste évidemment élevé”, a dit Edouard Philippe.

“HARMONISATION DES CONDITIONS D‘INDEMNISATION”

La menace d‘attentats préparés par des équipes de djihadistes encore implantées en Syrie et en Irak est “très sérieuse” même si l‘EI recule territorialement, souligne pour sa part le directeur général de la sécurité intérieure, Laurent Nunez, dans Le Figaro.

L‘hebdomadaire Charlie Hebdo a par ailleurs fait l‘objet ces deux dernières semaines de nouvelles menaces, qui ont conduit à l‘ouverture d‘une enquête préliminaire.

Les autorités sont aussi confrontées au problème des centaines de Français ayant combattu sous la bannière de l‘EI en Irak et en Syrie et de leurs familles qui souhaitent rentrer en France.

“Toute personne qui revient des terrains de combat est judiciarisée”, a souligné la ministre de la Justice, Nicole Belloubet.

La garde des Sceaux a précisé sur RTL que huit mineurs âgés de 16 à 18 ans et ayant combattu étaient détenus en France.

“Tous les mineurs font l‘objet d‘une judiciarisation, ils sont tous présentés à un juge, y compris les plus jeunes”, a-t-elle dit.

Pour les victimes des attentats, la garde des Sceaux a évoqué la possibilité d‘une juridiction dédiée aux personnes qui contestent leur indemnisation.

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

The U.S.-sponsored event about “The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation” jarred with many other nations, which want negotiations on the 2015 Paris Agreement to focus on renewable energies.

“So you claim to be an American, but we see right through your greed,” dozens of protesters suddenly chanted at a meeting of U.S. officials and fossil fuel and nuclear experts to the tune of “God Bless the USA”.

They said the United States should keep coal “in the ground” and then walked out, leaving the 220-seat meeting room half-empty.

George David Banks, a special assistant to Trump on energy and the environment, said the panel was “only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the needs of the global energy system”.

Trump, who doubts that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of rising temperatures, said in June that he plans to pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement and instead promote jobs in the fossil fuel industry.

No country has followed his lead.

Coal now supplies a third of all energy used worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, with big shares in China and India.

“The question needs not to be ‘if’ we use coal but ‘how’,” said Holly Krutka of Peabody Energy, one of the panelists. “Fossil fuels are part of the energy mix for decades to come”

“Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy,” said Lena Collar, of nuclear engineering company Musicale Power, a panelist who said she personally opposed Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement.

Still, Trump’s views on coal are mirrored in many nations, even though the Paris agreement has a goal of ending the fossil fuel era sometime from 2050-2100.

Energy ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) issued a statement in September that “reaffirmed the need for increased promotion of clean coal technologies.”

Earlier on Monday, scientists said world carbon emissions mainly from burning fossil fuels are set to rise 2 percent this year to a new record, dashing hopes that global emissions had already peaked.

And opponents of Trump said the focus should be firmly on renewable energy. “No one is going to listen to someone who says climate change is a hoax,” said Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, referring to past Tweets by Trump.

Outside the U.S. meeting, other protesters who were unable to get in asked: “What do we want? Climate justice”.

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

A second PK5 resident and a security source, who asked not to be named, confirmed that three motorcycle taxi drivers were killed in retaliation for the concert attack.

“Even now there is sporadic gunfire in PK5 and the surrounding neighborhoods are emptying,” said Gedeon Leki, a resident of the nearby Castors neighborhood. “People are afraid the Muslims could take revenge for their dead.”

Nearly five years into the conflict in CAR, which has been marked by successive waves of ethnic cleansing, the security situation is worsening, particularly in the east.

Bangui, where the headquarters of 12,000-troop-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission is located, has been relatively stable in recent months, and the weekend’s violence was a reminder of the city’s darkest days.

“The enemies of peace ... have just set a trap,” Prime Minister Simplice Mathieu Sarandji said in a radio address on Sunday. “I call upon the population not to slide back into violence.”

The U.N. Security Council is this week scheduled to vote on a French-drafted resolution to authorise an extra 900 troops to protect civilians in Central African Republic.","Seven dead in concert attack, reprisals in Central African Republic",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DD0NB-OZATP

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

Buying into Bank Danamon would nicely round out the regional presence of the $87 billion Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. And when it comes to both price and politics, MUFG looks better placed than the Southeast Asian group’s previous suitor.

A man smokes a cigarette near a Danamon Bank ATM in Jakarta May 22, 2013. Shares in Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk PT dropped as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, pressed down by uncertainty over whether Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd will be able to purchase a majority stake in the Indonesian lender. REUTERS/Beawiharta (INDONESIA - Tags: BUSINESS) - GM1E95M1A6L01

Five years ago, Singaporean state investor Temasek tried to sell its controlling stake in Danamon to financial compatriot DBS. That sparked a backlash. Jakarta then stuck caps on bank ownership, killing the takeover in 2013, and sending an ugly message about its openness to foreign capital.

Now, however, Reuters says MUFG is talking to Temasek about buying a 40 percent stake in Indonesia’s fifth-largest lender for roughly 200 billion yen, or $1.8 billion.

MUFG needs to diversify away from its mature home market. Southeast Asia offers both proximity and growth potential, and an Indonesian outpost would complement existing interests in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Danamon is also on the up; analysts reckon earnings will leap 48 percent this year and return on equity will hit a solid 10.6 percent. The Indonesian bank trades at just 1.4 times trailing book value, Eikon shows. That suggests a reasonable price, even if 68 percent owner Temasek demands a big premium for ceding control. DBS had been ready to pay 2.6 times, and in 2015 Taiwan’s Cathay Financial paid 3.2 times for a stake in the smaller Bank Mayapada Internasional.

The bigger question is around control. If MUFG has to abide by Indonesia’s 40 percent ownership ceiling, this would make any deal less attractive, because it would limit the buyer’s influence and because bank-capital rules penalise minority holdings. That’s partly why another lender that once harboured regional ambitions, Australia’s ANZ, has been selling off such stakes and retrenching.

That said, Jakarta can and does waive the cap - it did so for China Construction Bank last year. And a Japanese buyer is probably less controversial than one from neighbouring financial centre Singapore.

“The reason why it does so well is it is anonymous. It’s anonymous, and it’s cross-border,” Fink, whose firm oversees nearly $6 trillion of assets, said at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit. “If you legitimize it, you know who your counterparties are...the question is how many people will use it if you have to acknowledge you are a buyer or a seller.”

Fink called bitcoin a “very speculative instrument. More importantly, it is an instrument that people use for money laundering.”

The value of bitcoin plunged as much as 29 percent from its Nov. 8 record high of $7,888 following the cancellation of a planned technology upgrade and amid persistent concern of a bubble. Bitcoin recouped some of its losses on Monday.

Investors who have held bitcoin for the long term have fared well.

Even after the recent drop, its value has increased more than sixfold this year. Investors who held on longer have been rewarded even more: in 2011, bitcoin traded at below $3.

Fink, however, said most investors with long-term horizons, and who are keeping “record amounts” on the sidelines, should be focused on traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.

He said that for a 30-year-old person, “100 percent equities is the right investment strategy,” at a time when the world’s economies are enjoying “synchronized growth” for the first time since the financial crisis.

Bitcoin ""is tiny in the scheme of financial markets,"" Fink said. Overall, ""there's too much focus on bitcoin,"" Fink said. ""I don't know why it has so much fascination for the press.""

Juan Ángel Napout, formerly president of the South American soccer governing body CONMEBOL and Paraguay’s soccer federation, Manuel Burga, former president of Peru’s soccer federation and José Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil’s soccer federation are on trial in federal court in Brooklyn.

The three men are the first to stand trial since U.S. prosecutors unveiled a corruption case against soccer officials around the world more than two years ago. Of 42 people charged by U.S. prosecutors in the FIFA probe, 24 have pleaded guilty and two have been sentenced so far.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Edelman told jurors that the three men were part of a conspiracy to take bribes from sports marketing companies in exchange for lucrative marketing rights to soccer tournaments, including the Copa America and Copa Libertadores.

“The defendants cheated the sport in order to line their pockets with money that should have been spent to benefit the game, not themselves,” Edelman said. The money they pocketed could have been spent by soccer organizations to build fields, buy equipment and fund women’s teams and youth leagues, he said.

None of the lawyers for the former officials denied that there was corruption in international soccer, but all told jurors that their clients had not taken part.

“This case is not about FIFA,” said Napout’s lawyer, Silvia Pinera. “It’s about one man, Juan Angel Napout, and his fight for justice.”

Pinera told jurors that the case against Napout would rely on testimony from Alejandro Burzaco, the former head of sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias. Burzaco, she said, “cut a sweetheart deal with the government and began telling stories” after he was indicted.

Burga’s lawyer, Bruce Udolf, also said he expected prosecutors to rely on cooperating witnesses who might be motivated to “get pretty doggone creative” to avoid prison.

Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate were debating their respective plans this week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Republicans are aiming to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand Trump his first major legislative victory. The two chambers hope to resolve their differences in time to enact the legislation by the end of the year.

“I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post.

Trump has repeatedly pushed for the tax reform bill to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Neither House nor Senate proposals include such a provision.

“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added.

Republican tax plans in the House and Senate would each add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, but lawmakers will have to iron out differences including the treatment of the deduction for state and local taxes, when to start a cut in the corporate tax rate and whether to scrap the estate tax on inheritances.

The House is expected to pass its tax bill this week, while the Senate debates its proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate hoped to have its version ready to be considered the week after Thanksgiving.

The two plans have some different details but are “similar conceptually,” McConnell said in his home state of Kentucky.

Senators began tweaking their proposal on Monday. An amendment introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch would remove the provision that currently lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans.

The prospects for the provisions Trump pushed were uncertain.

The Senate proposal calls for keeping seven tax brackets but cutting rates, including the top tax rate for the highest earning taxpayers, to 38.5 percent from 39.6 percent. The House wants to reduce the number of brackets, but leave the 39.6 percent top rate alone.

The Congressional Budget Office said last week that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than it originally forecasted.

Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying.

The Trump administration is trying to drum up support for the tax reform effort in U.S. towns and cities as well as on Capitol Hill.

Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.

Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed associated with the August election, which was later voided by the Supreme Court, and in unrest surrounding the re-run of the presidential vote last month.

Stephanie Moraa, an 8-year-old girl in the Nairobi slum of Mathare, died after being hit by a stray bullet as police fired to disperse protesters on Aug. 12, the day after election results were announced. And the parents of six-month-old Samantha Pendo said she was teargassed and clubbed by police who invaded their home in Kisumu looking for protesters.

On Monday, the government-funded but civilian-run Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had forwarded its findings and recommendations to the director of public prosecutions “for review and direction”.

Asked on Monday what IPOA had recommended to the prosecutor’s office regarding the two deaths, spokesman Dennis Oketch said: “It’s a matter which will most likely end up in court. We don’t want to give any information that can become prejudicial. We will wait for the [prosecutor‘s] review.”

IPOA’s statement did not specify if it had identified suspects in the two deaths. It did not mention any other investigations into election-related violence.

POLICE BEATINGS AT UNIVERSITY

It has however, completed another investigation into alleged police beatings at a demonstration in September at Kenya’s oldest university that sparked opposition anger at what they see as a pattern of police brutality.

IPOA said it had recommended to a police service commission that it take “stern disciplinary action against the responsible Commander”. It had also forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor’s office, the statement read.

Shortly after the August election, IPOA said it was fast-tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible.

Kenyan police dispute those accounts. The National Police Service described a report last month by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on 33 deaths in Nairobi during the crackdown as “totally misleading and based on falsehoods”.

Despite its history of police brutality, Kenya is an economic and transport hub in East Africa and important Western ally against militant Islam that receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain.

The IPOA was set up in 2011 after the killings of around 1,200 people in violence following the disputed 2007 election. It has received more than 9,000 complaints of police brutality and corruption since then.

Last year, it secured its first conviction, of two police officers sentenced for the death of a 14-year-old girl shot dead during a house raid in 2014.

A survey last year by the non-profit International Police Science Association ranked Kenya’s police force as the 125th worst-performing out of 127 national police forces studied. Only forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria did worse, measured on factors such as “process” and “legitimacy.”","Alleged Kenyan police killing of girl, baby in vote-related violence likely to reach court: official",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DD1EO-OZATP

Virginia-based DXC Technology Co (DXC.N) will develop the center to create digital services for its global clients, which total nearly 6,000 across 70 countries, the company said in a statement.

DXC was formed in April by a merger between CSC and Hewlett’s Enterprise Services business.

To secure the project, Louisiana offered DXC an $18.7 million incentive package in performance-based grants payable over five years, according to a statement from Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards’s office.

DXC shares closed up 0.9 percent at $96.80 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

The company plans to hire 300 employees in 2018, and over five years will create 2,000 jobs in all, according to the governor’s statement.

The project is estimated to generate $64.3 million in new state taxes from 2018 to 2025, the statement said.

“These are permanent, direct jobs right here,” Governor Edwards said during a news conference on Monday. “That’s why it’s so exciting.”

A “vast majority” of the jobs will be new positions added to the company’s payroll, DXC spokesperson Rich Adamonis said in an email.

To meet the labor demand, Louisiana will fund a $25 million higher education initiative to increase the amount of degrees awarded in computer science, management and STEM-related studies, the governor’s statement said. “STEM” is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

“Our partnership with local colleges and universities will be important to our success and will increase the number of graduates and skilled professionals in technology-related fields in the city and across the region,” DXC’s chief executive, Mike Lawrie, said in a statement.

The company expects the center’s operations to begin in January.","IT services company says New Orleans project will create 2,000 direct jobs",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-louisiana-jobs/it-services-company-says-new-orleans-project-will-create-2000-direct-jobs-idINKBN1DD2QH?il=0

Infographic ID: '2sWkzTB'

Now foreign companies that have spent billions of dollars on U.S. factories and local leaders who host them worry that global supply networks that back those investments will fray if Trump makes good on his pledge to roll back trade liberalization.

The U.S. president has threatened to tear up North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and slap higher tariffs on nations that run trade surpluses with the United States, such as Germany or China. The administration is also discussing tighter immigration rules and more security screening of investment.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

Credit Suisse traders improperly shared information to manipulate currency prices and benchmark rates, and took advantage of its electronic trading platform to trade ahead of known client orders, the New York State Department of Financial Services said.

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank engaged in “unsound conduct” from at least 2008 to 2015 by failing to control its foreign exchange business, the regulator said.

Credit Suisse said it was “pleased to have reached a settlement with the DFS that allows the bank to put this matter behind it,” and said it did not admit to any findings.

The agreement is the latest in a string of global regulatory settlements with big Wall Street banks over forex trading practices.

Rivals including Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays PLC (BARC.L), and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS.L) collectively paid $10 billion in 2014 and 2015 to settle probes by U.S. and European authorities that their forex traders coordinated to cheat clients and boost their own profits.

Since 2014, New York has been investigating whether banks under its aegis used algorithms on their trading platforms to front-run or otherwise manipulate foreign exchange rates.

Credit Suisse, like numerous other foreign banks, operates in the United States through foreign branches that are licensed and regulated by New York state.

Earlier this year, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay New York $350 million to settle similar claims, and Barclays paid $635 million in 2015.

The probe is still ongoing in relation to other banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In a statement, DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo blamed Credit Suisse’s conduct on executives who “deliberately fostered a corrupt culture that failed to implement effective controls.”

As part of its settlement, Credit Suisse agreed to improve its controls and compliance, and retain a consultant to review its remedial efforts for at least a year.

Like other banks, Credit Suisse foreign exchange traders used chat rooms to share confidential customer information, coordinate trades and try to manipulate currencies or benchmark rates, DFS said.

Through these communications, the traders were able to trade ahead of clients, or use a tactic called “building ammo,” with which they coordinated activity with other traders to ensure they were not taking positions that would hurt one another, the regulator said.",NY state regulator fines Credit Suisse $135 mln over forex practices,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-gp-forex-settlement/ny-state-regulator-fines-credit-suisse-135-mln-over-forex-practices-idINKBN1DD2AY?il=0

In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, North Korean U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the United States was “running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean Peninsula.”

Three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups have been involved in the joint exercise in the Western Pacific in a rare show of force as President Donald Trump visits Asia. The last time three U.S. carrier strike groups exercised together in the Western Pacific was in 2007.

South Korea has said the joint drill, due to finish on Tuesday, was in response to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations and to show any such developments by Pyongyang can be repelled with “overwhelming force.”

However, Ja said Washington was to blame for escalating tensions and accused the U.N. Security Council of ignoring “the nuclear war exercises of the United States who is hell bent on bringing catastrophic disaster to humanity.”

Ja asked Guterres to bring to the attention of the 15-member council - under the rarely used Article 99 of the U.N. Charter - “the danger being posed by the U.S. nuclear war exercises, which are clearly threats to international peace and security.”

Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that Kim had insulted him by calling him “old” and said he would never call the North Korean leader “short and fat.”

A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year - much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes.

U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas, along with wind and solar power. And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U.S. coal.

”We’re not planning to build any additional coal facilities,“ said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power, one of the largest U.S. utilities. “The future for coal is dictated by economics … and you can’t make those kinds of investments based on one administration’s politics.”

Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP’s capacity for power generation, a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030.

(For a graphic on coal production, demand and employment, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zKY1tQ)

The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends. As some energy experts have said all along, the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office.

A White House official did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents major U.S. coal companies.

“The government is no longer against us,“ he said. ”We now only have market forces to contend with.”

Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election.

The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; ended an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands; ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams; and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Now Trump’s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90-day supply of coal on site. The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants, a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable.

While the full impact of Trump’s coal policy could take years to understand, the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand, energy analysts and utility officials said.

“BACK 100 PERCENT”

Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation.

The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978. Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003.

“We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent,” Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016.

So far, progress has been limited.

U.S. coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year, to 790 million tons, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 2018 output is expected to decline.

The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51,900 in October, up about 2,200 since November 2016 - but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak, according to the Labor Department.

On November 1, Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet, saying, “It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!”

But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U.S. coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia, according to James Stevenson, a coal analyst at IHS Markit.

During the first six months of 2017, Asian countries took in 7.5 million short tons of U.S. coal, up 97 percent over the same period in 2016, according to the EIA.

That demand will soon fade, Stevenson said.

“We are not going to get a repeat of 2017,” he said of the spike in exports.

“OBSOLETE”

Forecasts from utilities and the U.S. government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound.

Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13,600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018. That follows a loss of nearly 8,000 MW this year and 13,000 MW in 2016, according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data.

By 2025, coal-fired power plant capacity will dip to 226,380 MW, down about 30 percent from 2011, according to EIA.

Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close, bringing the number of plants that shut, or plan to, to 265 since 2010 - a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain, according to the Sierra Club, which has campaigned against coal.

Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power - and not by environmental regulations.

Duke Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, has shut down more than 5,400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2,000 MW by 2024.

Over the next decade, Duke plans to invest $11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power - and nothing in new coal-fired generation, said spokesman Rick Rhodes.

A Nov. 2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - which has two of the largest coal producers in its district, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc - said coal-fired power plants “may eventually become obsolete.”

Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook.

Peabody expects a “modest number” of coal power plant retirements in the coming years, with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output, spokesman Vic Svec said. Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast.

Robert Murray, the chief executive of privately-held Murray Energy Corp - one of America’s biggest underground miners - said Trump could do more for the industry. The administration, Murray said, should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health.

But Trump’s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives, which have bi-partisan backing. And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so-called “endangerment finding” on emissions that is the basis of many fossil-fuel regulations, given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it.

Murray Energy, meanwhile, announced on Oct. 31 it will buy a 30.5 percent stake in a coal-mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources, LLC.

The deal might help the companies cut costs, but it’s unlikely to help workers: Murray said about 200 of 1,000 jobs in Utah could be lost.","A year after Trump's election, coal's future remains bleak",http://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-coal-revival/a-year-after-trumps-election-coals-future-remains-bleak-idUSKBN1DD0IA?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted a Trump administration request to block at least temporarily a judge’s ruling that had put the new ban on hold. Trump’s ban was announced on Sept. 24 and replaced two previous versions that had been impeded by federal courts.

The action means the ban will apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad who do not have connections to the United States.

Those connections are defined as family relationships and “formal, documented” relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. Those with family relationships that would allow entry include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States.

The ruling does not affect people from the two other countries listed in Trump’s ban, North Korea and Venezuela.

“We are reviewing the court’s order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay. We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said.

The state of Hawaii, which sued to block the restrictions, argued that federal immigration law did not give Trump the authority to impose them on six of those countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu ruled last month that Hawaii was likely to succeed with that argument.

Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the court’s decision tracked what the Supreme Court said in June when it partially revived Trump’s second travel ban, which has now expired.

“I‘m pleased that family ties to the U.S., including grandparents, will be respected,” Chin added.

Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, just a week after he took office, and then issued a revised one after the first was blocked by the courts. The second one expired in September after a long court fight and was replaced with another revised version.

Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Muslim militants. As a candidate, Trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Critics of the travel ban in its various iterations call it a “Muslim ban” that violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion.

The 9th Circuit is due to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 6. In a parallel case from Maryland, a judge also ruled against the Trump administration and partially blocked the ban from going into effect.

The man accused of tackling Paul and breaking his ribs, Rene Boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said.

Boucher is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30.

Boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (305 m) between himself and Paul remained in effect.

It is yet another battle for May after scandals and gaffes that have brought questions about her leadership into the open. As many as 40 of her MPs would support a no-confidence motion against her, according to the Sunday Times newspaper.

But many sources in her governing Conservative Party say now is not the time to force her out because despite backing Britain remaining in the EU, even if reluctantly, they think she is still the best option to deliver Brexit.

That makes the debates over EU withdrawal bill all the more important as a test of her ability to steer through legislation she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change when Britain leaves in March 2019.

With the power balanced in favour of MPs rather than the government after the Conservatives lost their majority in a June election, many - even within the party - will use the debate over coming weeks to put the pressure on.

“We have no intention of parliament being a bystander, we are a key participant in this process,” said Hilary Benn, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party who is chair of the Brexit parliamentary committee.

“In the end we are going to have to vote on the final deal, and the outcome of the election and the balance of votes in the House of Commons now really does bring that home,” he told the Institute for Government thinktank earlier this month.

‘COPY AND PASTE’

The public debate in parliament on Tuesday is the first of eight to discuss the bill before it goes on to other legislative stages. The schedule will be determined by the House of Commons over the course of the debates.

MPs have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill, which largely ‘copy and paste’ EU rules and regulations into British law but also, critics say, hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning.

The bill is separate from negotiations going on in Brussels, but the EU will want to see how many and which amendments are passed and will regard the showdown as a test of May’s strength at home.

May is under pressure to make progress with the EU at a summit in December after growing European frustration over Britain’s refusal to say how much it thinks it should pay to leave.

The amendments include one to stop the government from adopting the so-called Henry VIII powers, named after the 16th century monarch who ruled by proclamation, which allow the government to amend laws being transposed from EU law.

Other amendments address criticism that parliament will not get a “meaningful vote” on the deal eventually agreed with the EU, and press the government to enshrine in law the EU protections Britons now enjoy such as workers rights and environmental protections.

The government has signalled it is willing to bend on the Henry VIII powers, and May’s environment minister, Michael Gove, has signalled he will ensure environmental standards by creating an independent watchdog.

The first debate will cover the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 European Communities Act on the retention, conversion and interpretation of existing EU laws, and EU rights.

“Getting parliamentary scrutiny is a winner. The government will change position because it doesn’t want a defeat,” said one Conservative lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.

But other issues, such as the push for a vote in parliament on the EU deal which could force the government back to the negotiating table, or even possibly overturn Brexit, present huge challenges.

The debate comes at a new low point for May since she was made prime minister after Britain voted for Brexit last June.

She has lost two ministers in a week, and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is under pressure from the opposition to resign over comments about a jailed aid worker in Iran, a case further complicated at the weekend by Gove, his ally.

On Monday, Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman for the Labour Party, launched a new bid to derail the withdrawal legislation, saying May’s policy to end the jurisdiction of the EU court - the European Court of Justice - was incompatible with her own policy for a smooth transition after Brexit.

“Over recent weeks, it has become increasingly clear that you alone do not have the authority to deliver a transitional deal with Europe and to take the necessary steps to protect jobs and the economy,” he wrote in an open letter to May.","Weaker than ever, May faces test in parliament over Brexit plans",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-bill/weaker-than-ever-may-faces-test-in-parliament-over-brexit-plans-idUKKBN1DD1WT

DXC was formed in April by a merger between CSC and Hewlett’s Enterprise Services business.

To secure the project, Louisiana offered DXC an $18.7 million incentive package in performance-based grants payable over five years, according to a statement from Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards’s office.

DXC shares closed up 0.9 percent at $96.80 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

“These are permanent, direct jobs right here,” Governor Edwards said during a news conference on Monday. “That’s why it’s so exciting.”

A “vast majority” of the jobs will be new positions added to the company’s payroll, DXC spokesperson Rich Adamonis said in an email.

To meet the labor demand, Louisiana will fund a $25 million higher education initiative to increase the amount of degrees awarded in computer science, management and STEM-related studies, the governor’s statement said. “STEM” is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

“Our partnership with local colleges and universities will be important to our success and will increase the number of graduates and skilled professionals in technology-related fields in the city and across the region,” DXC’s chief executive, Mike Lawrie, said in a statement.

When a resident organized a beach clean-up that collected 33 tons of rubbish in a single summer, British-Ethiopian safari organizer Ben Morrison decided he couldn’t stand by while his beloved island was ruined.

So the tall, bearded 42-year-old decided to try to design a traditional dhow, or sailing boat, from recycled plastic, offering a market to recyclers and persuading locals to conserve shrinking woodland.

“It is getting harder and harder for boat builders to find wood. I hope that this project will allow the ancient skills of boat building to live on, by shifting from ever-scarce wood to plastic,” Morrison told Reuters.

Plastic pollution is a growing global problem, with patches of sea larger than some countries covered in plastic soup that strangles or poisons wildlife. The U.N. says by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish unless drastic action is taken.

In August, Kenya introduced one of the world’s toughest bans on plastic bags mandating four years in prison or a fine of $40,000 for even using one.

The East African country is now contemplating measures to control plastic bottles, said John Konchellah, chairman of the National Environment Management Authority.

“We want to see plastic bottles out of circulation,” he told Reuters. “We want to borrow some technology from the region like PETCO in South Africa, where major manufacturers came together with a body that recycles plastic bottles.”

Petco is a company formed by the South African plastics industry to recycle some types of plastic.

Morrison, working with eight expert Kenyan boat builders, is using plastic planks from the fledgling local recycling industry to build his boat, which he hopes to sail to Cape Town in South Africa.

“We struggle to produce a consistent material out of the recycled plastic,” he said. “It’s not easy. Sometimes we receive plastic planks from the factory that are full of air bubbles. We can’t build with them and so we have to start from the beginning again.”

Ali Skanda, a 44-year-old master boat builder, said in his childhood there was no litter on Lamu’s sandy golden beaches - just fishermen, dhows and donkeys. Now many donkeys are dying from eating plastic, he said - and so are turtles, cows and other animals.

“At the beginning I thought it was a crazy idea. How could I build a boat out of plastic?” he asked. “Some people have been asking what we can do about this problem. There is so much plastic scattered. This is something we can do.”",Kenya craftsmen to build boat out of plastic waste,https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1DA237

In a specially equipped pen, sheep were shown pictures of people on two computer screens, on one side would be an unknown person and on the other would be one of four celebrities.

The animal would receive a reward of food for choosing the photograph of the celebrity by breaking an infrared beam near the screen displaying it. If they chose the wrong photograph, a buzzer would sound and they would receive no reward.

The sheep eventually managed to identify the familiar face eight times out of every 10.

“We’ve shown that sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable with those of humans and monkeys,” Professor Jenny Morton, who led the study, said in a statement.

In addition to being shown images of the celebrities facing forward, scientists also tested the animals’ ability to recognize the faces in photographs taken from other angles.

A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem ""Els Segadors,"" or ""The Reapers"" has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band's most popular single since they started in 2008. Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone's fourth-biggest economy. Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band's lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band's version of ""Els Segadors"" on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band's new full-length album, ""It Was Metal,"" to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that. ""We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like,"" she said. ""But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality."" ""Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician,"" Osegueda said. Music stations in Catalonia picked up the song and Osegueda was interviewed on several radio shows. The attention she has received has spread to her relatives as her Catalonian uncle was interviewed on local radio. On the band's YouTube page, fans have left messages saying they prefer the metal version to the original and many have said the song has struck an emotional chord. Osegueda recorded some parts of the song in Catalan. She doesn't speak the language and singing with proper pronunciation was intimidating, but she says the enthusiasm and support from her new found fans has been humbling. ""You know, we're not on a label. We do everything ourselves. So when we see this many people responding, it's like it's overwhelming,"" Osegueda said.

Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.

Iran’s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.

The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.

Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.

At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000.

Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children’s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.

ANGRY PEOPLE

Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.

“We need a shelter,” a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. “Where is the aid? Where is the help?” His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.

An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake’s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq’s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran.

Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded.

Iraq’s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district’s only hospital was severely damaged.

“The situation there is very critical,” Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters.

The district’s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.

The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.

“I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.

“I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: ‘Earthquake!'”

An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.

“I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,” a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.

Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah’s main hospital had been badly damaged.

NO SHELTER

Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people.

Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.

Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.

Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said.

Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.

“My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,” Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.

Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.

A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.

Unlike Qatar, the world’s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas with a population of just 300,000, Lebanon has neither the natural nor financial resources to ride it out, and people there are worried.

Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf region, and remittances flowing back into the country, estimated at between $7-8 billion a year, are a vital source of cash to keep the economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning.

“These are serious threats to the Lebanese economy which is already dire. If they cut the transfer of remittances, that will be a disaster,” a senior Lebanese official told Reuters.

Those threats came from Lebanon’s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, who resigned on Nov. 4 in a shock broadcast from Riyadh that Lebanese political leaders have ascribed to pressure from the Saudis.

Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, on Sunday warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living in the Gulf.

And he spelled out Saudi conditions for Lebanon to avoid sanctions: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group that is Lebanon’s main political power and part of the ruling coalition, must stop meddling in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen.

According to a Lebanese source familiar with Saudi thinking, Hariri’s interview “gave an indication of what might be waiting for us if a real compromise is not reached. The playbook is there in Qatar.”

Hariri’s resignation has thrust Lebanon to the center of an escalating rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

The non-confrontational Saudi policy of the past towards Lebanon has gone, analysts say, under the new leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32-year-old son of King Salman.

He is now the de facto ruler of the kingdom, running its military, political and economic affairs.

Whether Iran and Hezbollah are willing to make significant concessions to Riyadh is doubtful, sources said.

“They (Hezbollah) might make some cosmetic concessions, but they won’t submit to the Saudi conditions,” a source familiar with Hezbollah thinking said.

“BALL IN HEZBOLLAH‘S COURT”

Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum said Riyadh wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon and press President Michel Aoun to open dialogue and address their conditions on Hezbollah’s regional interventions.

“They need to come up with a position that will be satisfactory to the Saudis ... If the Saudis decide on sanctions they will do it,” Naoum said.

A source close to Hariri said he had ”put the ball in the court of Aoun, Hezbollah and its allies, by saying ‘business cannot continue as usual.’

“There was no sugar-coating. The sanctions were spelled out clearly. They want Lebanon to be disassociated from Hezbollah”.

Aoun has welcomed comments that the former premier planned to return home soon, palace sources said on Monday.

Saudi frustration with Lebanon seems to have boiled over after a string of setbacks to its foreign policy.

Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015.

Saudi Arabia has accused Iran and Hezbollah of backing the Houthis, and also said Hezbollah had a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month.

Hezbollah and Iran’s involvement in Syria has also transformed the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi support for Sunni rebels in Syria’s civil war have amounted to little.

Hezbollah, a movement with a heavily armed fighting force in addition to seats in parliament and government, is Iran’s spearhead in the region.

Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard looks to be trying to replicate it by building coalitions of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, according to some analysts.

The list of potential sanctions against Lebanon, political sources there say, could include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.

Some of those have been imposed on Qatar, but that blockade, initiated in June, has had limited effect on the emirate so far, beyond driving it closer to Iran.

NEW SAUDI POLICY

Allegiance to foreign backers is not new to Lebanon. Sunnis have always looked to Saudi Arabia for support and funding while Shi‘ite Lebanese tended to turn to Tehran and Hezbollah.

“The Lebanese have always been agents of foreign powers. They take their money, make promises, commitments and alliances,” Naoum said. But while Hezbollah fulfilled its promises to Iran, Sunni factions let Riyadh down, he said.

Thanks in part to Iranian investment in the group, Hezbollah now calls the shots in the Lebanese capital as well as playing a pivotal role in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Riyadh has historically channeled billions of dollars to Lebanon to help its reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war and following massive Israeli incursions of south Lebanon.

Now it appears ready to do serious economic damage to Lebanon that could weaken Hezbollah’s standing at home and in the region, should its demands not be met.

The Saudi conditions are causing alarm among some Lebanese, who have long viewed Hezbollah as a “state-within-a-state”. Many believe the solution is outside the control of local players.

The bill would exempt banks with less than $250 billion in assets - including BB&T, SunTrust Banks and American Express - from heightened regulatory scrutiny, in a move that could redraw the domestic U.S. banking landscape by reducing costs and unleashing a wave of mergers and acquisitions activity.

The Senate bill, which is more limited in scope than the House’s original proposal, has nine Democratic co-sponsors, meaning it is likely to pass into law.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo struck the deal with a group of moderate Democratic senators including Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, Jon Tester and Mark Warner, who took over the discussions with Crapo after the committee’s ranking Democrat, Sherrod Brown, walked away from the talks last week.

“The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks,” Crapo said in a statement.

The move has been strongly opposed by consumer advocacy groups such as Americans for Financial Reform and some powerful Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who argue it will increase risks to the system, potentially hurting consumers.

“I understand my colleagues’ interest in agreeing to this legislation, but disagree on the wisdom of rolling back so many of Dodd-Frank’s protections with almost no gains for working families,” Brown said in a statement.

The KBW Regional Banking Index turned positive around midday and was last up about 1.4 percent after steadily climbing in afternoon trading.

RAISING THE THRESHOLD

Central to the bipartisan discussions has been the asset threshold at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions or “SIFIs,” subjecting them to much stricter oversight including higher capital buffers.

That threshold starts at $50 billion, but Monday’s bill would raise it to $250 billion, releasing more than a dozen banks from the stricter rules, according to an analysis by the government’s Office of Financial Research.

Banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would

be exempt once the bill is enacted, while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would be exempted 18 months later.

The bill would give the Federal Reserve discretion to release banks in the second bracket from the SIFI designation prior to the 18-month deadline if it sees fit, and to reinstate them as SIFIs afterward, subject to certain conditions still being drawn up.

Raising the threshold would not only reduce costs for many banks but allow those that have hovered beneath the $50 billion threshold to do deals and expand their balance sheets without fear of being caught by stricter oversight.",Senate reaches preliminary deal on easing bank rules,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-banks/senate-reaches-preliminary-deal-on-easing-bank-rules-idUSKBN1DD2A5?il=0

Alongside the trucks a bustling microeconomy has sprung up of traders peddling cigarettes, water and diesel as drivers wait to clear Chinese customs in a queue that can stretch for 130 kilometres (80 miles).

(Click reut.rs/2yowSsj to view a picture package on the truck traffic jams on the China-Mongolia border.)

A rebound in coal prices and a surge in exports to China this year has meant a bonanza for miners in Mongolia, and a vital lifeline for the country’s tiny economy, after a currency and debt crisis forced it to seek an economic rescue package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

But long delays at the Gashuun Sukhait-Gants Mod crossing, the main transit point between the two countries, are undercutting those gains as fleets of trucks carrying coal from Gobi desert mines to China pile up at the border.

The long delays have been blamed on a surge in traffic driven by the thriving cross-border coal trade. However, Mongolia’s inability to stop rampant smuggling across the border has also played a role as China has imposed more stringent checks on incoming deliveries in recent months.

Customs officials in China’s Inner Mongolia declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The General Administration of Customs in Beijing also did not respond to requests for comment.

RECOVERY STALLED

The rise in coal prices this year has doubled border traffic, according to local police, putting law enforcement and customs staff under heavy pressure in both China and Mongolia.

With Gobi miners hoping to boost output further next year in a bid to take advantage of higher prices in China the bottlenecks are expected to get worse.

An environmental crackdown in China has resulted in the closure of hundreds of mines and the restriction of coal deliveries into smaller ports, driving up prices.

Curbs on coal imports from North Korea as a result of international sanctions against Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program have also allowed Mongolia to fill the breach.

Mongolia’s coal exports to China rose more than four-fold in the first half of the year, but growth has petered out since the delays at the border crossings first arose in July.

SEARCH ""WIDER IMAGE"" FOR ALL STORIES. TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY.

Bataa Davaasuren, director of Mongolia’s Customs House at Gashuun Sukhait, said customs on both sides of the border were short-staffed, adding that the situation had been exacerbated by events like the Chinese Communist Party Congress in October.

Mongolia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the problem was initially caused by the Naadam summer festival, when many Mongolians take long holidays.

Mongolian customs officers are also taking more time to screen cargoes after their Chinese counterparts complained that raw meat and even guns had been secreted in coal heading to China, Davaasuren said.

There was even one incident when a driver tried to sneak a live wolf across the border, he said.

“Nobody wants the long queue, of course,” said Davaasuren, who said the problem would quickly disappear if Mongolian customs could raise its handling capacity to 3,000 trucks a day from 700 currently. “It’s bad for the drivers and the country, so we’re all working to resolve the issue.”

When trucks aren’t stuck in grinding traffic, just getting to the border is also a harrowing ordeal, as vehicles speed towards China and back down the one-lane road. With no street lamps to guide the way and drink-driving a constant problem, danger levels increase at night, drivers say.

“It’s very risky,” said one driver, who identified himself as Bat-Erdene. “We see flipped-over cars on the side of the road every day.”

On a recent trip down the road, a team of Reuters journalists saw numerous overturned trucks and vehicles smashed up from head-on collisions littering the side of the road.

“We see unbelievable things,” said Dunshig Baasanjav, a driver standing outside his truck amid the motionless traffic. “Others who see it would think it’s the worst they’ve ever seen, but we see it all the time. We’re numb to it.”

Miners say the long-term solution to the border bottleneck problem is a new rail link connecting mines with the Gashuun Sukhait crossing.

Mongolia built more than 200 kilometres of foundations for railway tracks for the link but the project was put on hold after financing ran dry.

Local authorities believe the project may have to start again from scratch because the foundation blocks have been left at the mercy of Mongolia’s harsh environment for so long.

Whatever the fate of the railroad, those plying the roads from the Gobi to China in stop-and-go traffic have little choice but to keep driving given the lack of opportunities in a country strapped by austerity measures linked to the IMF bailout.

“This job is very risky and life threatening, but we have no other choice,” said Choijiljav Ganbold, a trucker who emerged from his truck as the sun set on the motionless traffic.

South Africa relies on foreign investors to finance its hefty budget and current account deficits. Investors are nervous ahead of important credit rating reviews scheduled this month and with the ruling African National Congress gearing up to elect Zuma’s successor as party chief in December.

The presidency said on Monday that Zuma would make an announcement on the higher education report once ministers had processed its findings.

Zuma set up the commission early last year in response to protests by university students demanding free education.

The rand and benchmark bonds weakened after the presidency said it would publish the report on Monday, but they were little changed after its release.

Currency traders and analysts said markets were waiting to see how the presidency would react to the report, but they said its recommendations were risky from an economic standpoint.

“If we start repeating this pattern of recording higher and higher budget deficits we are undoubtedly headed for downgrades,” said senior Nedbank economist Nicky Weimar.

South African GDP was around 4.3 trillion rand ($296.6 billion) last year, so an increase in government spending on higher education of 0.25 percent of GDP would amount to around $750 million of additional expenditure.

The commission also recommended that all university students should be funded through a cost-sharing model, whereby the government would guarantee income-contingent loans issued by commercial banks. Should a student fail to reach a certain income level, the state should repay the tuition loan, it advised.

Introducing those measures would make it more difficult for Treasury to rein in a projected budget deficit of over 4 percent of GDP for the 2017/18 fiscal year.

But it would be popular among young people and ANC voters, many of whom are dissatisfied that South African society remains deeply unequal more than two decades after the end of apartheid in 1994.

South Africa next holds a national election in 2019, and the ANC has seen its electoral majority shrink in elections.

TROUBLE AT TREASURY?

South African markets have also been pressured by fears that the independence of financial institutions is under threat.

Local media outlet Fin24 cited sources on Monday as saying that Treasury Deputy Director-General Michael Sachs had resigned last week after complaining that Zuma was interfering in the budget process.

Treasury confirmed Sachs’ resignation, saying only that his departure was because he wanted to “serve the public sector in a different capacity”.

International ratings agencies downgraded South Africa’s debt earlier this year after Zuma fired respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle.

S&P Global and Moody’s are expected to review the country’s ratings again on Nov. 24, and all eyes are on whether they will downgrade its local-currency rating to “junk” status after Gordhan’s replacement, Malusi Gigaba, unveiled dismal medium-term budget forecasts last month.

Downgrades to sub-investment grade could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of South African bonds and pile further pressure on the rand, which is already trading at a 12-month low against the dollar.

South Africa’s debt insurance costs hit a four-month high on Monday, reflecting a greater likelihood of ratings downgrades.",South African commission urges more education spending before ratings reviews,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DD1QP-OZATP

Jewish groups have called on the Polish authorities to condemn the message of banners with slogans such as “pure blood, clear mind” or “Europe will be white or uninhabited” that some nationalists carried at a march on Nov. 11 - the anniversary of Polish independence from Russia, Austria and Germany at the end of World War One.

The Independence March has become an annual event in recent years, separate from official ceremonies to mark the holiday, and has attracted many people apart from far-right sympathisers.

The government of the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) condemned the racist banners, but not the march itself. PiS won election in 2015 partly thanks to support from younger voters, who have increasingly embraced right-wing views in recent years.

“Extremely bad incidents have taken place,” Kaczynski said, calling the banners a marginal phenomenon and “disgraceful rubbish”. “Polish tradition - the one we invoke - has nothing to do with anti-Semitism, we are as far as possible from that, nothing to do with racism.”

He also said that tens of thousands of “decent” people had come to the march to express their attachment to Poland.

The PiS government refused to take in migrants mostly from the Middle East and North Africa under an EU relocation deal, arguing that it could put public safety at risk. The party enjoys the steady support of more than a third of Poles.

Poland was for generations home to one of Europe’s biggest Jewish communities, until nearly all perished in Nazi death camps during German occupation in World War Two.

The American Jewish Committee (AJC) lobby group urged Polish authorities on Monday to speak out against the far-right, saying it threatened “the core values of Poland and its standing abroad”.

Duda responded to the banners by saying: “There is no place or permission or in our country for xenophobia, there is no permission for sick nationalism, there is no place for anti-Semitism ... Such attitudes mean an exclusion from our society.”

Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said marches to celebrate Independence Day were important and should not be marred by “absolutely unacceptable” banners.

Credit Suisse traders improperly shared information to manipulate currency prices and benchmark rates, and took advantage of its electronic trading platform to trade ahead of known client orders, the New York State Department of Financial Services said.

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank engaged in “unsound conduct” from at least 2008 to 2015 by failing to control its foreign exchange business, the regulator said.

Credit Suisse said it was “pleased to have reached a settlement with the DFS that allows the bank to put this matter behind it,” and said it did not admit to any findings.

The agreement is the latest in a string of global regulatory settlements with big Wall Street banks over forex trading practices.

Rivals including Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays PLC (BARC.L), and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS.L) collectively paid $10 billion in 2014 and 2015 to settle probes by U.S. and European authorities that their forex traders coordinated to cheat clients and boost their own profits.

Since 2014, New York has been investigating whether banks under its aegis used algorithms on their trading platforms to front-run or otherwise manipulate foreign exchange rates.

Credit Suisse, like numerous other foreign banks, operates in the United States through foreign branches that are licensed and regulated by New York state.

Earlier this year, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay New York $350 million to settle similar claims, and Barclays paid $635 million in 2015.

The probe is still ongoing in relation to other banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In a statement, DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo blamed Credit Suisse’s conduct on executives who “deliberately fostered a corrupt culture that failed to implement effective controls.”

As part of its settlement, Credit Suisse agreed to improve its controls and compliance, and retain a consultant to review its remedial efforts for at least a year.

Like other banks, Credit Suisse foreign exchange traders used chat rooms to share confidential customer information, coordinate trades and try to manipulate currencies or benchmark rates, DFS said.

Through these communications, the traders were able to trade ahead of clients, or use a tactic called “building ammo,” with which they coordinated activity with other traders to ensure they were not taking positions that would hurt one another, the regulator said.",NY state regulator fines Credit Suisse $135 mln over forex practices,https://www.reuters.com/article/credit-suisse-gp-forex-settlement/new-york-state-regulator-fines-credit-suisse-135-million-over-forex-practices-idINKBN1DD2BN?il=0

A U.S. embassy measure showed levels of poisonous airborne particles, known as PM 2.5, had reached 498 on Monday afternoon, compared with the upper limit of “good” quality air at 50.

India’s weather office said rain was forecast over the next three days which could help clear the smog.

“Light rainfall is likely in states surrounding Delhi and in Delhi over the next three days, and this could result in a change in wind pattern in the region,” Charan Singh, a scientist at India Meteorological Department, told Reuters.

“Smog will start to abate starting tomorrow.”

But Skymet, India’s only private weather forecaster, said dense smog would continue over Delhi and the surrounding area for at least the next two days.

The Supreme Court is due to hear a petition filed by a New Delhi lawyer to direct government authorities to tackle the “intolerable and unbearable air pollution”.

The Delhi state government declared a public health emergency last week after pollution levels spiked, a yearly phenomenon blamed on a combination of illegal crop burning in northern states, vehicle exhaust and dust.

Over the weekend, authorities began using fire trucks to spray water in parts of the capital to keep the dust and other air particles down, but it has had little effect.

A senior federal government official said there was little more that could be done.

“We can only do this much, and now we will have to wait for rains to clean the atmosphere,” said Prashant Gargava, an official at the Central Pollution Control Board.

Gargava, who is in charge of monitoring air quality, said Delhi’s air has been consistently in the “hazardous” zone, despite measures such as a halt to construction and increasing car parking charges four-fold to encourage people to use public transport.

EVERY BREATH

The PM 2.5 airborne particles are about 30 times finer than a human hair. The particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases and other ailments. Hospitals have seen a surge of patients coming in with respiratory complaints, according to media reports.

“Every second we are damaging our lungs, but we cannot stop breathing,” said Arvind Kumar, the head of the chest and lung surgery department at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital.

United Airlines said it had resumed flights from Newark, New Jersey, to New Delhi on Sunday, after suspending the service temporarily over concern about the bad air.

Authorities decided to reopen schools on Monday after closing them temporarily for a few days last week, but the decision is likely to add more vehicles on the road.

Enforcement agencies said they were unable to impose a blanket ban on the movement of commercial trucks.

Primary school teacher Aarti Menon said her family had been wearing face masks, even when indoors.

“Not everyone can afford an air purifier or air-conditioned car. We are all living in hell,” said Menon, a mother of two teenage daughters.

The National Green Tribunal, an environment court, has directed the city government and neighboring states to stop farmers from burning crop stubble. But the governments have not been able to do so.

New Delhi-based non-government group TARA Homes for Children, which supports 60 poor children, said it was seeking donations to buy at least five air purifiers.

“We feel like we’re just in the right spot,” Thomas Kunkel, the insurer’s president of bond and specialty insurance, said during an investor meeting in Connecticut.

Travelers has increased its cyber business at a 40 percent compound annual growth rate since 2011 and could quicken the pace, Kunkel said. “It would not be hard,” he said.

But Travelers must be “respectful and prudent” about the risks involved in cyber, Kunkel said.

Insurers have said the growing sophistication of hackers alongside a still-evolving cyber insurance industry makes it difficult to quantify their potential cyber-related losses.

About three-quarters of cyber policies that Travelers writes cover up to $1 million in damages, while nearly a quarter cover between $1 million and $5 million, the company said.

“We manage our limits very closely,” Kunkel said.

Equifax Inc (EFX.N), which compiles credit information about consumers and assigns them scores, disclosed in September that cyber criminals had breached its systems between mid-May and late July and stolen the sensitive information of 145.5 million people. The hack is among the largest ever.

Regulation will also drive demand for cyber insurance, particularly in the financial services sector, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Monday.

“As the cyber insurance market develops, competition is likely to erode profit margins,” Fitch said.

Some insurers who ultimately enter the cyber market may lack underwriting experience and take on risks that could exceed their capital, Fitch said.

Events that could trigger large claims include cyber attacks on electronic grids and transportation systems, or hacks of large data storage clouds, Fitch said.

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

Derek Kan, who was previously an official at San Francisco-based ride services company Lyft Inc, was expected to win confirmation to be under secretary of transportation for policy.

Senate Republicans have said their Democratic rivals were stalling a number of nominees over a dispute over funding for the $24 billion “Gateway Program,” which includes building a new tunnel underneath New York’s Hudson River. At least eight other Transportation Department nominations are pending and other jobs vacant, including a top auto safety regulator.

In September, President Donald Trump met with top elected officials from New York and New Jersey at the White House over the fate of the Gateway Program deemed critical to northeast U.S. transportation, but Trump made no commitments to finance the project.

Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the committee overseeing the Transportation Department, accused Democrats of holding nominations “hostage” while awaiting “assurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund” the Gateway project.

“While no one questions the importance of this corridor, there are many other important projects that also are awaiting approval and funding at the Department. No project should get to cut the line based on the machinations of a handful of our” colleagues, Thune said.

A spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer declined to comment, but a Senate Democratic aide said Democrats were indeed holding up some nominations “because they want assurances from the Transportation Department that the Gateway Project will quickly move forward after it’s funded.”

In addition to confirming Kan, the Senate was due to vote on Monday on whether to end debate on the nomination of Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer, to be general counsel at the Transportation Department.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Bradbury was one of the principal authors of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” called the “torture memos” by critics. Bradbury defended his work in June, saying the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.”

Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.

Iran’s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.

The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.

Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.

At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000.

Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children’s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.

ANGRY PEOPLE

Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.

“We need a shelter,” a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. “Where is the aid? Where is the help?” His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.

An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake’s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq’s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran.

Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded.

Iraq’s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district’s only hospital was severely damaged.

“The situation there is very critical,” Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters.

The district’s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.

The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.

“I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.

“I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: ‘Earthquake!'”

An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.

“I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,” a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.

Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah’s main hospital had been badly damaged.

NO SHELTER

Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people.

Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.

Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.

Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said.

Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.

“My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,” Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.

Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.

A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.

“The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,” Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.","Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450",https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DC0WM

The government will let foreigners control financial-sector joint ventures, and says it will eliminate ownership caps completely in a few years. Western financiers have been burned by such promises before. But the $10 trillion in uninvested savings languishing in local banks, plus a burgeoning wealth management industry, should encourage experienced players to take a second swing.

Foreign interest in securities joint ventures involving Chinese partners has steadily waned over the past decade, due to lacklustre performance and differences over strategy - the latter aggravated by the lack of control. At the same time, overseas interest in mainland stocks and bonds has faded in the face of volatility, policy opacity, and the difficulty of repatriating profits. China has gone without foreign money that would have helped it meet its own goal of cutting overall indebtedness.

The relaxation of the rules, coming after U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, marks a diplomatic solemnification of a process already underway. In June, UK-based HSBC (HSBA.L) was allowed to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture. Foreign asset managers have been launching wholly owned entities in anticipation of the full opening of China’s mutual fund industry, which Z-Ben Advisors estimates to have $1.7 trillion under management. It’s the second-largest market of its kind in the region, growing at a rollicking compound growth rate of 29 percent.

It’s true, local competitors look intimidating. Domestic giants like CITIC (600030.SS) and Haitong Securities (600837.SS) have moved steadily up league tables, and the fund management industry is cutthroat. Distortions in Chinese stock, bond and derivatives markets are unresolved. But as execution and efficiency become more important than plain old access to cheap capital, the Western players ought to have an advantage.

Foreign institutions have another selling point: they have big businesses outside of the People’s Republic. There’s a massive pile of cash held uninvested by the Chinese middle class, that could be put to more productive use. As Chinese warm to overseas stocks and bonds, foreign firms who jump in now will be well-positioned to sell into the trend. That’s worth the effort.

CONTEXT NEWS

- The Chinese government on Nov. 11 said it will raise foreign ownership limits in domestic financial firms, a long-anticipated step allowing foreign partners to take more control. The changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint-venture firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent.

- Full foreign ownership of local firms involved in the futures, securities and funds markets will be permitted after three years, while full overseas ownership of insurance firms will be allowed after five years. The foreign ownership limit of 20 percent on a single entity basis and 25 percent on an aggregate basis of any Chinese owned bank and financial asset management company will be removed.

- The announcement followed a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to China, during which the two sides announced of bilateral deals and investments which the Chinese government said were worth a combined $250 billion.

- Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told a news conference that the change will come into effect following drafting of related rules.

Weyburn, to be sold to the western Canadian energy company Whitecap Resources Inc (WCP.TO), is the last of four main assets for which Cenovus has reached agreements to sell to pay down debt incurred in the C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips (COP.N) assets this year.

The Weyburn sale would bring Cenovus’ asset sale proceeds to just under C$4 billion, compared with its target of C$4 billion to C$5 billion in asset sales.

Reuters last week reported Whitecap was a front-runner in bidding for the asset and intended to raise about C$700 million through a share sale and fund the rest through debt.

Cenvous said in a statement on Monday the sales of Weyburn and other assets would help it retire a C$3.6 billion bridge loan it took for the ConocoPhillips deal, a move that is expected to please investors who balked at how the deal was financed.

The acquisition eventually led to Cenovus’s naming Alex Pourbaix, a former executive at TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO), as its chief executive officer, replacing Brian Ferguson, who led the deal.

Cenovus has said it may also sell part of the Deep Basin gas assets it acquired from ConocoPhillips.

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Investors in defence companies tend to profit from geopolitical tensions. The year since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election has been no different: the Thomson Reuters Global Aerospace and Defense Index is up by almost a third since the truculent tycoon won the White House. Giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin can thank North Korean missile tests, expectations of a more muscular United States and rising defence budgets in the Middle East and Asia, which are increasing spending on planes, arms and other equipment at a compound annual rate of 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively, according to Bernstein analysts.

As Ultra’s disappointing 2017 forecasts show, Britain is the outlier. The 1 billion pound group blamed “mounting pressures in the funding of UK defence” for the Ministry of Defence cancelling or delaying programmes. Revenue will be 770 million pounds this year, the company said after markets closed on Friday, compared with previous consensus forecasts of about 810 million pounds.

British defence spending has shrunk to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product from around 2.5 percent in 2010-11, according to data provider Statista. With Brexit likely to hurt output and potentially blow a hole in the public finances, mid-sized UK groups like Ultra and Cobham are unlikely to get much of a boost. They’re also hit harder than bigger peers, as more revenue comes from discretionary spending rather than long-term contracts. Their shares are down 33 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the past two years.

The decline may make Ultra attractive to potential larger acquirers, which could cut costs and gain greater control over supply chains. After Monday’s drop, a buyer would have to shell out around 1.5 billion pounds for Ultra, including debt and a 30 percent equity premium. If the new owner could increase 2018 operating profit by about a 10th, the acquisition could deliver a decent 8 percent return, according to a Breakingviews calculation.

Shweta Rajpal Kohli, a former Indian journalist who joined Uber last year, would join cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com Inc next month, the sources told Reuters.

Uber said it did not have an immediate comment. Kohli did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Kohli was mostly tasked with building Uber’s relations with regulators and government officials in India, a market where the firm has faced several regulatory and reputational hurdles.

One source said Kohli “was leading government engagements in the influential circles, so her exit is a step back for Uber.”

The sources asked not to be identified as the details were not public yet.

Uber was briefly banned in New Delhi after one of its drivers raped a woman passenger in 2014.

Uber hired a law firm this year to investigate how the firm managed to obtain the medical records of the rape victim, an incident that led to criticism of the culture at the U.S. firm, sources told Reuters in June. Uber declined to comment.

Kohli is the latest senior executive to leave Uber. The firm’s European policy chief quit in October, shortly after the departure of Uber’s top boss in Britain.

Uber has suffered a tumultuous few months which has seen former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick forced out after a series of boardroom controversies and other regulatory battles in multiple U.S. states and around the world.

Uber counts India as its second-biggest market after the United States. It operates in about 30 Indian cities and competes with Ola, a ride hailing service backed by Japan’s Softbank.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar.

In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, North Korean U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the United States was “running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean Peninsula.”

Three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups have been involved in the joint exercise in the Western Pacific in a rare show of force as President Donald Trump visits Asia. The last time three U.S. carrier strike groups exercised together in the Western Pacific was in 2007.

South Korea has said the joint drill, due to finish on Tuesday, was in response to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations and to show any such developments by Pyongyang can be repelled with “overwhelming force.”

However, Ja said Washington was to blame for escalating tensions and accused the U.N. Security Council of ignoring “the nuclear war exercises of the United States who is hell bent on bringing catastrophic disaster to humanity.”

FILE PHOTO - North Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations Ja Song Nam attends a ministerial meeting at the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, U.S. September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith

Ja asked Guterres to bring to the attention of the 15-member council - under the rarely used Article 99 of the U.N. Charter - “the danger being posed by the U.S. nuclear war exercises, which are clearly threats to international peace and security.”

Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that Kim had insulted him by calling him “old” and said he would never call the North Korean leader “short and fat.”

Far more important to future election cycles than any help in prognosticating the public mood one or three years from now is what the results mean for the next round of redistricting that begins in 2021. Although the next redistricting process will not occur for another four years, what happened in elections throughout the country this week will have a significant impact. The governors, state legislators, mayors, and city council members elected this year will play a major role in drawing district lines – and thus setting the course for American democracy.

Under the U.S. Constitution, once a decade states must redraw their legislative lines for Congress, state legislatures, and even local governments like city councils. That task falls in most states to state legislatures and the state’s governor. The legislature will take the data it receives from the 2020 Census and draw district lines for congressional seats and the legislature itself, and the governor will decide whether to approve or veto those maps. City councils often use similar processes for their own lines.

It matters, then, who is charged with the task of drawing those maps. Politicians of both parties engage in extreme partisan gerrymandering, where they draw the lines to help their own political parties and their own electoral interests. The politicians essentially pick their constituents, instead of the other way around.

During the 2011 redistricting, Republicans controlled the majority of statehouses and governor’s mansions. They used that power to entrench their control. That is why, for example, Republicans won 60 of Wisconsin’s 99 state legislative seats in the 2012 election with only 48 percent of the vote. Similar tactics created disproportionately Republican state legislatures and congressional delegations across the country. In Pennsylvania, another swing state, Republicans gerrymandered their way into winning 13 of the state’s 18 congressional seats with only half of the votes cast in 2012. In Southern states such as North Carolina and Texas, Republicans drew districts that limit Democratic seats by minimizing the representation of minorities such as Latinos and African-Americans, which courts have ruled violates the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

Although it tends not to disempower under-represented minorities, Democrats frequently engage in gerrymandering too: Democrats in Maryland passed a pro-Democratic map that plaintiffs challenged as an unlawful partisan gerrymander. The litigation is still ongoing. City Councils are also not immune from the problem, often drawing the lines for their own elections that favor the incumbents or the party in control.

What yesterday’s elections mean, then, is that Democrats can greatly influence the redistricting process, at least in Virginia. (New Jersey uses an independent redistricting commission.) Democrats can, if they want, draw maps that will favor their side through 2030. Even if the Supreme Court overturns Wisconsin’s gerrymander in a highly-watched case this term, there still will be wiggle room for partisans to skew the maps toward their favor.

Fifty-nine of the nation’s 100 largest cities also held elections in 2017, mostly for mayor and city council. These smaller governmental entities will also engage in redistricting in 2021. Given that many of these positions have four-year terms, those elected this week will still be in office when the actual redistricting process begins.

And it is not just redistricting at stake. State legislatures have the power to enact numerous rules that affect the voting process, such as voter ID requirements or early voting periods. In 2016, Virginia’s Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe restored the voting rights of thousands of felons. This year’s Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, probably would not have done the same had he been in office. Gillespie also supports a strict voter ID requirement, which tends to reduce turnout among groups of voters who skew Democratic such as non-whites and young people. That kind of shaping of the electorate could have a significant impact on who wins Virginia – a key swing state − in the 2020 presidential election.

In New Jersey, Republican Governor Chris Christie vetoed a bill to implement automatic voter registration, in which the government would place eligible voters on the registration rolls, allowing them to opt-out instead of requiring them to opt-in. Automatic voter registration, which began in Oregon and is now sweeping the country, increases turnout. Democrat Phil Murphy’s win in New Jersey means that automatic voter registration will now likely become law – again impacting future elections. Automatic voter registration also might come to Washington state because a Democratic candidate is leading in the vote count from Tuesday in a race that will determine majority control of the state senate.

Of course, deciding who may vote should not be a partisan issue. Independent commissions or other nonpartisan approaches should determine redistricting. It should be easy and convenient for every eligible voter to participate. But that is not the current reality of American politics.

The best way to think about the 2017 elections is to consider them not for what they mean for Donald Trump but how they will determine the rules of elections for a decade or more.

Unlike Qatar, the world’s biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas with a population of just 300,000, Lebanon has neither the natural nor financial resources to ride it out, and people there are worried.

Up to 400,000 Lebanese work in the Gulf region, and remittances flowing back into the country, estimated at between $7-8 billion a year, are a vital source of cash to keep the economy afloat and the heavily-indebted government functioning.

“These are serious threats to the Lebanese economy which is already dire. If they cut the transfer of remittances, that will be a disaster,” a senior Lebanese official told Reuters.

Those threats came from Lebanon’s former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, who resigned on Nov. 4 in a shock broadcast from Riyadh that Lebanese political leaders have ascribed to pressure from the Saudis.

Hariri, an ally of Saudi Arabia, on Sunday warned of possible Arab sanctions and a danger to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese living in the Gulf.

And he spelled out Saudi conditions for Lebanon to avoid sanctions: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group that is Lebanon’s main political power and part of the ruling coalition, must stop meddling in regional conflicts, particularly Yemen.

According to a Lebanese source familiar with Saudi thinking, Hariri’s interview “gave an indication of what might be waiting for us if a real compromise is not reached. The playbook is there in Qatar.”

Hariri’s resignation has thrust Lebanon to the center of an escalating rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi‘ite Iran.

The non-confrontational Saudi policy of the past towards Lebanon has gone, analysts say, under the new leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32-year-old son of King Salman.

He is now the de facto ruler of the kingdom, running its military, political and economic affairs.

Whether Iran and Hezbollah are willing to make significant concessions to Riyadh is doubtful, sources said.

“They (Hezbollah) might make some cosmetic concessions, but they won’t submit to the Saudi conditions,” a source familiar with Hezbollah thinking said.

“BALL IN HEZBOLLAH‘S COURT”

Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum said Riyadh wanted Hariri to return to Lebanon and press President Michel Aoun to open dialogue and address their conditions on Hezbollah’s regional interventions.

“They need to come up with a position that will be satisfactory to the Saudis ... If the Saudis decide on sanctions they will do it,” Naoum said.

A source close to Hariri said he had ”put the ball in the court of Aoun, Hezbollah and its allies, by saying ‘business cannot continue as usual.’

“There was no sugar-coating. The sanctions were spelled out clearly. They want Lebanon to be disassociated from Hezbollah”.

Aoun has welcomed comments that the former premier planned to return home soon, palace sources said on Monday.

Saudi frustration with Lebanon seems to have boiled over after a string of setbacks to its foreign policy.

Riyadh has been bogged down in the war it launched against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen in 2015.

Saudi Arabia has accused Iran and Hezbollah of backing the Houthis, and also said Hezbollah had a role in firing a ballistic missile from Yemen towards Riyadh earlier this month.

Hezbollah and Iran’s involvement in Syria has also transformed the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi support for Sunni rebels in Syria’s civil war have amounted to little.

Hezbollah, a movement with a heavily armed fighting force in addition to seats in parliament and government, is Iran’s spearhead in the region.

Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard looks to be trying to replicate it by building coalitions of militia groups in Iraq and Syria, according to some analysts.

The list of potential sanctions against Lebanon, political sources there say, could include a ban on flights, visas, exports and transfer of remittances.

Some of those have been imposed on Qatar, but that blockade, initiated in June, has had limited effect on the emirate so far, beyond driving it closer to Iran.

NEW SAUDI POLICY

Allegiance to foreign backers is not new to Lebanon. Sunnis have always looked to Saudi Arabia for support and funding while Shi‘ite Lebanese tended to turn to Tehran and Hezbollah.

“The Lebanese have always been agents of foreign powers. They take their money, make promises, commitments and alliances,” Naoum said. But while Hezbollah fulfilled its promises to Iran, Sunni factions let Riyadh down, he said.

Thanks in part to Iranian investment in the group, Hezbollah now calls the shots in the Lebanese capital as well as playing a pivotal role in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Riyadh has historically channeled billions of dollars to Lebanon to help its reconstruction after the 1975-90 civil war and following massive Israeli incursions of south Lebanon.

Now it appears ready to do serious economic damage to Lebanon that could weaken Hezbollah’s standing at home and in the region, should its demands not be met.

The Saudi conditions are causing alarm among some Lebanese, who have long viewed Hezbollah as a “state-within-a-state”. Many believe the solution is outside the control of local players.

“Lebanon will pay the price,” a top Lebanese banker told Reuters. “The only pressure the Saudis have is economic ... they can put pressure by imposing sanctions that can hurt.”",Fears for Lebanese economy if Saudis impose Qatar-style blockade,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-analysis/fears-for-lebanese-economy-if-saudis-impose-qatar-style-blockade-idUSKBN1DD2IB

U.S. stock indexes made little ground. Some investors sought bargains after a few days of losses while others were put off by a dividend cut and weak financial forecasts at heavyweight General Electric (GE.N) which plans to radically shrink to focus on aviation, power and healthcare.

Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives’ bill.

“What the market seems to be focused on is if and when tax reform will be agreed on by Republicans in both the Senate and the House and how it’ll fare in Congress,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.

While senators and representatives are trying to reach a deal, investors can still hope, said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

“They’re still working through the math attached to the two plans. They still have to go through reconciliation but the fact the conversations are happening is a positive.”

That’s a blow for ECB supervisory tsar Daniele Nuoy. The strict new guidelines for bad debt she unveiled on Oct. 4 could now become bogged down in a legal fight. The proposals, the legal opinion says, amounted to a new set of binding pan-European rules for lenders – the domain of EU lawmakers, not the ECB. The central bank can only issue recommendations to individual banks.

Resurgent economic growth in countries such as Italy, whose banks hold 175 billion euros of EU NPLs, presents an opportunity to take bolder steps to address the problem while times are good. The ECB has suggested that new rickety loans should be completely written off within a maximum of seven years, and not sit on the banks’ books indefinitely. Italy, for one, fears its lenders will not be able to do it with comfort that quickly.

In fairness, the ECB move looked a tad cheeky. For a start, it was hidden in an addendum to existing guidelines. And its “comply or explain” approach would make it difficult for banks to deviate from the standard line without being perceived as financially weak. With an eye on the central bank’s proposals, investors have already picked out lenders that look vulnerable like Italy’s Banco BPM and UBI Banca, whose shares dropped sharply in the days after the ECB proposal was unveiled.

If the European Parliament, where Italian politicians hold key positions, prevails the ECB’s overall drive to repair bank balance sheets could suffer.

Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.

Iran’s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.

The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.

Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.

At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000.

Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children’s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.

ANGRY PEOPLE

Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.

“We need a shelter,” a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. “Where is the aid? Where is the help?” His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.

An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake’s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq’s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran.

Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded.

Iraq’s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district’s only hospital was severely damaged.

“The situation there is very critical,” Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters.

The district’s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.

The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.

“I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,” said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.

“I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: ‘Earthquake!'”

An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.

“I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,” a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.

Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah’s main hospital had been badly damaged.

NO SHELTER

Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people.

Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather.

Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.

Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said.

Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.

“My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,” Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.

Iran’s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported.

Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.

A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.

“The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,” Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.","Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450",https://www.reuters.com/article/iraq-quake-iran/strong-earthquake-hits-iraq-and-iran-killing-more-than-450-idINKBN1DD080

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

Nur noch 38 Prozent der Befragten würden laut einer forsa-Umfrage für RTL für die Christsozialen stimmen, wenn am kommenden Sonntag Landtagswahlen wären. Bei der Landtagswahl 2013 waren es noch 47,7 Prozent. Bei einer Bundestagswahl würden nur noch 36 Prozent ihr Kreuz bei der CSU machen, drei Prozentpunkte weniger als bei der Wahl im September. Dem Trendbarometer von RTL und n-tv zufolge sind 72 Prozent der Bayern dafür, dass Seehofer seine Ämter als Ministerpräsident und CSU-Chef räumt. Unterdessen kritisierte am Montag mit Markus Feber ein weiterer CSU-Bezirksvorsitzender die Debatte um Seehofer und forderte auch mit Blick auf die Jamaika-Verhandlungen im Bund Zurückhaltung.

Seehofer und der bayerische Finanzminister Markus Söder ringen derzeit um die Macht in der Partei und die Führung im größten Bundesland. In Bayern wird im Herbst 2018 ein neuer Landtag gewählt. Anhänger Söders haben Seehofer aufgefordert, bei der Landtagswahl nicht erneut anzutreten.

Ferber sagte, er teile die Mahnung der Chefin des größten CSU-Bezirks Oberbayern, Ilse Aigner, dass sich jetzt alle erst einmal etwas zurücknehmen sollten. “Ich glaube schon, dass momentan viele, gerade in Bayern, sich nicht mehr amüsieren, sondern angewidert von der CSU abwenden und dieses Spektakel nicht mehr sehen wollen”, sagte der Vorsitzende des CSU-Bezirks Schwaben im Deutschlandfunk. Aigner hatte am Wochenende von einem katastrophalen Erscheinungsbild ihrer Partei gesprochen und bemängelt: “Die Menschen bekommen das Gefühl, uns interessierten nur unsere Politikerkarrieren.”

While Ireland is most worried about the damage Brexit may do to its economy and border with the British province of Northern Ireland, the loss of a major pro-business country that has a big influence on financial regulation and trade is also a concern.

Dublin is responding by boosting other alliances. Donohoe joined a dinner of his Nordic and Baltic counterparts at last week’s EU finance ministers’ meeting while Prime Minister Leo Varadkar held a meeting with a similar group, plus the prime minister of the Netherlands, at a recent EU leaders’ summit.

“Many of our neighbours and friends within the European Union were quite happy to let countries like Ireland and the UK do the work on their behalf of making the public case that needed to be made,” Donohoe told Washington’s Brookings Institute at the start of a four-day trip to the United States.

“I don’t think it will be a case, necessarily, of new allies .... It’s more the need for these friendships to be now more proactively vocal than they have been in the past and more the case now that there will be an awareness that a big country has gone.”

Donohoe, whose predecessors have relied on neighbouring Britain’s support in areas such as defending its low corporate tax rate from French and German calls for greater harmonisation, said the smaller countries share strong common views.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected October’s retail inflation at 3.46 percent, up from 3.28 percent in September.

INDRANIL PAN, GROUP ECONOMIST, IDFC BANK:

“The inflation print was higher than our expectation. The uncertainty over impact of oil prices and extent of currency depreciation on inflation remains. Even if the GST rate cuts have a downside impact on inflation, it will be neutralized by higher oil and other commodity prices and currency depreciation. Given these facts there is no chance of RBI cutting rates going ahead.”

RUPA REGE NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCIAL:

“A sharp increase of 30 basis points in overall inflation to 3.58 percent on the back of an increase of 50 basis points in food inflation, and an uptick of 80 bps in fuel inflation rules out a remote chance of policy rate cut in December. Hardening trends in global crude prices and growth robustness in the U.S. would keep RBI’s hands tied.”

“Luckily, core inflation - ex food and ex fuel has come in at 4.6 percent - unchanged from the previous month’s level. This shows continued weaknesses in demand.”

A PRASANNA, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP:

“The October inflation is slightly above our estimate due to higher food prices. The normalization of food prices is continuing and we expect food inflation to continue rising till April-June 2018. Core inflation was flat over September in year-on-year terms but this masks a fall in fuel prices and a likely rise in core excluding fuel.”

“Overall, inflation trajectory continues to track slightly below the monetary policy committee (MPC) fanchart. We expect March CPI to print around 4.3 percent. While the recent GST rate changes could pose some downside risk to this estimate, crude prices pose an upside risk.”

“All said, we expect the MPC to maintain the status quo on policy even as their commentary will continue to be neutral to hawkish.”

TUSHAR ARORA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, HDFC BANK:

“Today’s reading has reaffirmed our position that the inflation trajectory in the second half of this year could be lower than the RBI’s projected path of 4.2 percent to 4.6 percent. Whether this transpires into a rate cut or not would depend on the central bank’s intent to utilize the plus or minus 2 percent band (around its 4 percent target).”

“In our view, though there is a risk of breaching the 4 percent target, the breach is unlikely to be substantial. While international commodity prices continue to rise, there are some offsetting factors vis-à-vis a cut in the GST rates and excise duty on petroleum products, and prudent increases in the minimum support prices of Rabi crops.”

RADHIKA RAO, GROUP ECONOMIST, DBS:

“Inflation has ticked up in October, a shade higher than consensus and our expectations. Food inflation ticked up due to a combination of base effects and higher perishables. Non-food pressures are a bigger problem at hand, from multiple fronts, from the fuel angle if the oil price spike is sharp and sustained, coupled with one-off impact of rent allowance and GST impact.”

“October’s CPI and the likelihood that the 4 percent target will be tested in the next quarter, reinforces our expectations that the RBI will stay on hold in December and in the rest of fiscal 2018. On the fiscal end, we expect a modest slippage in the targets due to lower revenue generation.”",Expert Views: India's October retail inflation touches seven-month high,https://www.reuters.com/article/india-economy-inflation-views/expert-views-indias-october-retail-inflation-touches-seven-month-high-idINKBN1DD1GT

The money is available because the country has beaten its 2017 bailout target for a primary surplus - which excludes debt servicing costs - of 1.75 percent of gross economic output, he said.

Tsipras came to power in 2015 promising to end austerity but was later forced to sign up to a new EU bailout, the country’s third, in exchange for more belt-tightening to keep Greece in the euro zone. He was re-elected and his term ends in late 2019.

His leftist-led government hopes that after seven years of crisis, Greece’s fiscal performance will help it emerge from EU bailouts in August 2018, when its current rescue package ends.

“For a second year, we are in a position to distribute a social dividend to the people who need it the most. Better prepared and more effective this year, we will be able to pay out an even bigger amount,” he said in a televised statement.

Last year, Tsipras unexpectedly announced that the state would pay out about 600 million euros to low-income pensioners, a move that angered the country’s international lenders.

This year’s handouts have been approved in principle by the lenders, who are reviewing Greece’s bailout progress. Their representatives are expected in Athens this month to resume talks on fiscal targets and on reforms.

“We (the institutions) have been discussing these ideas with the Greek authorities. The announcements seem broadly in line with these discussions, which have not been concluded yet,” an EU Commission spokesman said, adding that the proposals would be examined by the lenders.

Tsipras said about 720 million euros would be distributed by mid-December to 3.4 million Greeks as a one-off, tax-free benefit, based on income and wealth criteria and household size. The country’s population is about 11 million.

Another 315 million euros would be directed to pensioners, he said, to compensate them for “unfair” health contribution payments in 2012-2016, while 360 million euros would be paid to Greece’s biggest power utility, Public Power Corporation (DEHr.AT), to prevent electricity tariff increases.",Greece to distribute 1.4 billion euros to citizens hit by austerity,https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-pm/greece-to-distribute-1-4-billion-euros-to-citizens-hit-by-austerity-idINKBN1DD2LD?il=0

“I don’t want to be on a very select roll of wonderful people with a killer,” Geldof told state broadcaster RTE. “Someone who is at best a handmaiden to genocide and an accomplice to murder.”

More than 600,000 Muslims from Myanmar’s Rakhine state have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh after military operations described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing.

Their plight has drawn outrage around the world. But Suu Kyi, long seen as a champion of human rights, has been criticized for failing to speak out against violence. There have been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991.

Suu Kyi was given the Freedom of Dublin in 1999 while she was held under house arrest by Mayanmar’s then military government. She received her award at a reception in Ireland in 2012, two years after her release.

“Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honored her, now she appals and shames us,” Geldof said in a statement.

The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Micheal Mac Donncha, said the city council had discussed taking away the honor and the matter was still under review. Last month she was stripped of a similar honor by the British university city of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate.

But Mac Donncha, a councillor for the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party, also criticized Geldof’s gesture, saying it was ironic as Geldof held a British knighthood despite “the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe”.

The former Boomtown Rats singer was given an honorary knighted in 1986 in recognition of his charity work, including organizing the 1985 Live Aid concert to help those suffering from starvation and disease in Ethiopia.

Other foreign recipients of the Freedom of Dublin include John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev.

Irish rockers U2, who had campaigned for Suu Kyi’s release while she was a political prisoner, also voiced disappointment and said her silence was “starting to look a lot like assent”.

“Who could have predicted that if more than 600,000 people were fleeing from a brutal army for fear of their lives, the woman who many of us believed would have the clearest and loudest voice on the crisis would go quiet,” the band said in a statement.

“For these atrocities against the Rohingya people to be happening on her watch blows our minds and breaks our hearts.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump said in a joint statement on Saturday they would continue to fight against Islamic State in Syria, while agreeing that there was no military solution to the country’s wider, six-year-old conflict.

”I am having trouble understanding these comments,“ Erdogan told reporters before flying to Russia for talks with Putin. ”If a military solution is out of the question, then those who say this should pull their troops out.

“Then a political method should be sought in Syria, ways to head into elections should be examined... We will discuss these with Putin,” he said.

After more than four hours of talks with Putin in the southern Russian resort of Sochi, Erdogan said the two leaders had agreed to focus on a political solution to the conflict.

“We agreed that the grounds to focus on a political solution (in Syria) have been formed,” he said.

Putin said Russia would continue to work on Syria with Turkey and their efforts were yielding results: “The level of violence has definitely been reduced, favorable conditions are being created for the progression of a inter-Syrian dialogue.”

Neither leader went into more specific detail. Asked if the two discussed Erdogan’s earlier comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks were about more complex issues which could not be made public, according to RIA news agency.

Turkey has been annoyed by both Russian and U.S. missions in Syria. Before his trip to Russia, Erdogan said both Moscow, which backs President Bashar al-Assad, and Washington, which armed Syrian YPG Kurdish forces Ankara sees as allied to separatists fighting in southeastern Turkey, had set up bases.

“The United States said it would completely leave Iraq, but it didn‘t. The world is not stupid, some realities are being told differently and practiced differently,” he said.

He said the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The YPG has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces.

Russia has been a strong supporter of Assad, whose removal Erdogan has demanded, and Moscow’s military intervention two years ago helped turn the conflict in the Syrian president’s favor.

Turkish troops have also fought in Syria to halt the advance of Kurdish YPG forces along its frontier.

“We attach great importance to the joint steps Turkey and Russia will take on (the) defense industry,” Erdogan said.

His remarks follow Turkey’s recently completed purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a defense deal that Turkey’s Western allies see as a snub to the NATO alliance.

The weapon cannot be integrated into NATO defenses.

The demand has been made following a finance ministry assessment on Oct. 25 of the financial health of 14 state companies, including top miner NMDC Ltd (NMDC.NS) and trading firm MMTC Ltd (MMTC.NS), according to a government document reviewed by Reuters.

The ministry asked 12 of the companies to payout between 30 percent and as much as 100 percent of their 2016/17 or 2017/18 net profit in dividends, share buybacks or bonus shares. The other two companies were exempted.

All state companies evaluated by the government sought exemptions. The finance ministry, NMDC and MMTC did not reply to Reuters emails seeking comment.

India’s federal budget is under pressure this year following an unexpected slump in economic growth, which slipped to its lowest level in three years in the three-months ending June, the first quarter of the 2017/18 fiscal year.

As of September, the half-way mark for the fiscal year, the budget deficit had reached 4.99 trillion rupees or more than 91 percent of its full-year target.

Surjit Bhalla, a member of the prime minister’s economic advisory council, told Reuters in an interview in October that the government wanted to stick with a budget deficit target of 3.2 percent.

The government’s revenues have also been hit by a sharply lower dividend from the central bank.

DEMANDS

The assessment by the finance ministry did not specify the combined amount of payouts expected of the 12 companies.

But New Delhi has budgeted $21.86 billion in payouts from all state companies this fiscal year, slightly down on the previous fiscal year. Indian businesses have been disrupted by last year’s shock ban on high-value notes and the roll-out of a new national goods and services tax.

Indian state firms will only finalize their full dividend payouts for the current 2017/18 fiscal year in September next year.

NMDC has told the finance ministry it would only be able to pay less than half of the 25 billion rupees in dividend payouts that the government is demanding for the current fiscal year of 2017/18, a senior company executive said. He declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Three senior government officials said NMDC is reluctant to comply with the government’s demands because it already has to pay a 30-billion-rupee penalty to the eastern state of Odisha for illegal mining and needs cash for capital investments.

The senior company executive said a payment of 25 billion rupees to the government would mean paying out a further 35 billion rupees to other shareholders in the company.

“Where will the money come from?” the source said.

That would compare with NMDC’s projected 2017/18 net profit, based on Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate data, of 37.7 billion rupees.

NMDC has also been asked to issue bonus shares before Sept. 30, 2018, the document showed.

The government has asked MMTC to pay 300 million rupees in dividends and issue bonus shares for 2016/17. The firm is seeking exemptions from both.

“The committee noted that MMTC’s defined reserves and surplus is more than 10 times of its paid-up equity share capital,” the document said.

Three unlisted companies from defense and railways were asked to pay a maximum 100 percent of their net profit as dividend, the document showed.

A. Prasanna, an economist with ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai, said the government had the right to seek higher dividends from cash-rich companies as long as the money was sitting idle.

“But asking all public sector units to step up investments and dividends at the same time may become counterproductive,” he said.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Middle East tensions have supported the market, despite concerns that output could rise further.

“The rise by Saudi Arabia to produce more than 10 million barrels per day would have registered more,” said John Kilduff Partner at Again Capital. “This is a new level of geopolitical risk,” he said. Additionally, the market has less supply overhang than it did a year ago, he said.

On the supply side, tensions in the Middle East raised the prospect of disruptions, traders said. A purge this month of Saudi Arabia’s leadership by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is one of the key factors raising concerns about political stability of the region’s largest oil producer.

Other regional concerns include war in Yemen and growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran is a concern to investors too.

Additionally, traders said it was unclear whether a strong earthquake that hit Iran and Iraq on Sunday had affected the region’s oil production.

Bahrain said at the weekend that an explosion that caused a fire at its main oil pipeline on Friday was caused by sabotage, linking the attack to Iran, which denied any role.

Traders said crude prices were well supported as output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have contributed to a reduction in excess supply that had dogged markets since 2014.

OPEC forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018 and said its production-cutting deal with rival producers was reducing excess oil in storage, pointing to an even tighter global market next year. However, it also pointed out that Saudi output had risen above 10 million barrels per day.

The level of inventories held by industrialized above the five-year average “has fallen by more than 50 percent in 2017, with inventories currently at around 160 million barrels,” consultancy Timera Energy said.

“If current trends continue, inventories are likely to return to the five-year average at some stage in 2018,” it said, adding that strong demand had also helped reduce the glut.

OPEC has sought to push stocks to the five-year average.

Aus Sicht von EZB-Vize Vitor Constancio bleibt die Euro-Zone trotz der jüngsten Konjunkturerholung auf erhebliche geldpolitische Hilfen angewiesen. Als Hauptgrund nannte der Portugiese am Montag die aus EZB-Sicht unerwünscht niedrige Inflation. Trotzdem wird in Deutschland die Kritik an der jahrelangen EZB-Geldschwemme mit Nullzinsen und Anleihenkäufen immer lauter. Den richtigen Weg dabei zu finden, dürfte am Dienstag wieder Thema werden, wenn EZB-Chef Mario Draghi mit den Notenbankchefs der USA und Großbritanniens diskutiert. In beiden Ländern steigen die Zinsen bereits wieder.

“Wir erfüllen noch nicht unser Mandat und deshalb muss die Geldpolitik weiterhin sehr konjunkturstützend sein”, sagte Constancio in Frankfurt. Damit sichere die Europäische Zentralbank günstige Finanzierungsbedingungen, um Wirtschaftswachstum zu befördern sowie Löhne und Preise anzuschieben. Die Inflationsrate - das Hauptziel der EZB - liege noch immer unter der angepeilten Marke. Zudem sei die Hinterlassenschaft der weltweiten Finanzkrise nach wie vor in einer hohen privaten und öffentlichen Verschuldung in vielen Euro-Ländern sichtbar. “Diese hohen Schuldenniveaus machen die Länder anfällig für negative Schocks.”

Im Oktober waren die Verbraucherpreise in der Euro-Zone lediglich um 1,4 Prozent gestiegen. Die EZB strebt aber knapp unter zwei Prozent an, was aus ihrer Sicht das optimale Niveau für die Konjunktur ist, jedoch seit Jahren nicht erreicht wird. Die Euro-Wächter hatten zuletzt beschlossen, ihre Anleihenkäufe ab Januar auf 30 Milliarden Euro pro Monat zu halbieren. Die Transaktionen, die für mehr Inflation sorgen sollen und momentan die schärfste Waffe der Notenbank sind, werden dafür aber bis mindestens September 2018 fortgesetzt.

Die Wirtschaft der Euro-Zone sieht Constancio weiter auf Erholungskurs. “Das Geschäftsvertrauen ist auf einem Zehn-Jahres-Hoch und Umfragedaten deuten auf anhaltendes Wachstum in der nächsten Zeit hin.” Erstmals seit 2007 würden alle Euro-Länder ein reales Wachstum ihres Bruttoinlandsproduktes (BIP) aufweisen. Am Dienstag werden BIP-Daten aus der Euro-Zone, Deutschland und Italien erwartet.

In den USA werden die Zinsen unterdessen schon länger wieder moderat angehoben. Dieses Jahr hat die dortige Notenbank Fed die Zügel bereits zwei Mal angezogen und will noch einmal nachlegen, falls die Wirtschaft mitspielt. In der Diskussionsrunde am Dienstag in der EZB-Zentrale könnte Fed-Chefin Janet Yellen dazu weitere Hinweise geben.

Auch dürfte im Blick stehen, wie der Bank-of-England-Chef Mark Carney die Lage einschätzt. Die britische Zentralbank hatte unlängst die erste Zinserhöhung seit zehn Jahren gewagt. Anders als die Fed hatten die Pfund-Wächter in London die Zügel aber nicht wegen einer rund laufenden Konjunktur angezogen, sondern um die deutlich steigende Inflation im Zuge des Brexit-Votums einzudämmen.",EZB-Vize hält Notenbank-Konjunkturhilfen weiter für nötig,https://www.reuters.com/article/ezb-wirtschaft-inflation-idDEKBN1DD1KK

Investors in defence companies tend to profit from geopolitical tensions. The year since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election has been no different: the Thomson Reuters Global Aerospace and Defense Index is up by almost a third since the truculent tycoon won the White House. Giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin can thank North Korean missile tests, expectations of a more muscular United States and rising defence budgets in the Middle East and Asia, which are increasing spending on planes, arms and other equipment at a compound annual rate of 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively, according to Bernstein analysts.

As Ultra’s disappointing 2017 forecasts show, Britain is the outlier. The 1 billion pound group blamed “mounting pressures in the funding of UK defence” for the Ministry of Defence cancelling or delaying programmes. Revenue will be 770 million pounds this year, the company said after markets closed on Friday, compared with previous consensus forecasts of about 810 million pounds.

British defence spending has shrunk to 1.9 percent of gross domestic product from around 2.5 percent in 2010-11, according to data provider Statista. With Brexit likely to hurt output and potentially blow a hole in the public finances, mid-sized UK groups like Ultra and Cobham are unlikely to get much of a boost. They’re also hit harder than bigger peers, as more revenue comes from discretionary spending rather than long-term contracts. Their shares are down 33 percent and 37 percent, respectively, over the past two years.

The decline may make Ultra attractive to potential larger acquirers, which could cut costs and gain greater control over supply chains. After Monday’s drop, a buyer would have to shell out around 1.5 billion pounds for Ultra, including debt and a 30 percent equity premium. If the new owner could increase 2018 operating profit by about a 10th, the acquisition could deliver a decent 8 percent return, according to a Breakingviews calculation.

First proposed in the 1950s and long resisted by Britain, European defence planning, operations and weapons development now stands its best chance in years as London steps aside and the United States pushes Europe to pay more for its security.

Foreign and defence ministers gathered at a signing ceremony in Brussels to represent 23 EU governments joining the pact, paving the way for EU leaders to sign it in December.

Those governments will for the first time legally bind themselves into joint projects as well as pledging to increase defence spending and contribute to rapid deployments.

“Today we are taking a historic step,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters. “We are agreeing on the future cooperation on security and defence issues ... it’s really a milestone in European development,” he said.

The pact includes all EU governments except Britain, which is leaving the bloc, Denmark, which has opted out of defence matters, Ireland, Portugal and Malta. Traditionally neutral Austria was a late addition to the pact.

Paris originally wanted a vanguard of EU countries to bring money and assets to French-led military missions and projects, while Berlin has sought to be more inclusive, which could reduce effectiveness.

Its backers say that if successful, the formal club of 23 members will give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling international crises and end the kind of shortcomings seen in Libya in 2011, when European allies relied on the United States for air power and munitions.

Unlike past attempts, the U.S.-led NATO alliance backs the project, aiming to benefit from stronger militaries.

The club will be backed by a 5-billion-euro defence fund for buying weapons, a special fund to finance operations and money from the EU’s common budget for defence research.

Members will also be required to submit national plans and be subject to a review system identifying weak spots in European armies with the goal of plugging those gaps together.

Many governments say Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 was a turning point, after years of defence spending cuts that left Europe without vital capabilities.

“This is a commitment for countries to do better together,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. “It comes at a time of significant tension,” he said, referring indirectly to Russia’s rising military reach and Islamic militants who have attacked European cities.

ROLE FOR BRITAIN?

Despite an Anglo-French-led EU defence integration effort in 1998, Britain blocked formal collaboration on military matters, wary of the creation of an EU army.

Defence integration was revived by France and Germany, with support from Italy and Spain, in a show of unity after Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016.

The EU had struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and in Africa over the past 20 years and were caught off guard by Russia’s Crimea annexation.

As the EU initiative, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation, has gained momentum, British officials have been pressing for involvement. Britain’s aerospace industry and its biggest defence firm BAE Systems fear losing out, diplomats said.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson likened London’s support to Gothic architecture, saying: “We are there, like a flying buttress to support the cathedral,” he told reporters.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest.

“This is a conservative estimate based on similar efforts that have been done in New York, New Jersey and of course in Texas most recently,” Rossello said at a press conference streamed online from the National Governors Association in Washington.

“Now, I am however confident that we have turned a corner. That we are now flowing out of the life sustainment phase and we are starting the recovery phase, and the rebuilding phase,” Rossello said.

In a letter to President Donald Trump, Rossello said recovery from the storm, the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. commonwealth in 90 years, exceeded the resources of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund and associated programs.

At the top of priorities is $31.1 billion for housing, followed by $17.8 billion to rebuild and make more resilient the power grid.

Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner to the U.S. Congress Jenniffer González-Colón accompanied Rossello and said she introduced legislation to reform the disaster relief law known as the Stafford Act.

The reform would allow disaster recovery money to be used to modernize infrastructure, not just return it to recent condition. Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was already weak.

Restoring the power grid has been a top priority since Maria’s 150 mile per hour winds knocked it out completely on Sept. 20.

Rossello and the island’s power authority, PREPA, were criticized for a no-bid contract with a tiny private firm, Whitefish Energy, for a portion of the repairs. Rossello canceled the contract on Oct. 29 after an uproar over its provisions.

On Monday, a U.S. federal judge rejected a request by the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico to install a former military officer to oversee PREPA, a victory for Rossello, whose government opposed the appointment.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest readings indicate 47.8 percent of power capacity has been restored.

Puerto Rico’s economy was already in recession before Maria landed and its government filed for bankruptcy in the face of $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities.

Hariri, who threw Lebanon into political crisis by reading out his resignation on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, gave his first public remarks since then in an interview late on Sunday, saying he planned to return within days.

He suggested he could even withdraw his resignation, provided the Shi‘ite group Hezbollah -- allied to Saudi Arabia’s regional rival Iran -- renounces interference in conflicts across the Middle East.

The crisis has thrust tiny Lebanon -- where Sunni, Shi‘ite, Christian and Druze groups with backing from regional powers fought a 1975-1990 civil war -- to the forefront of the rivalry between Riyadh and Tehran being played out on battlefields from Syria to Yemen.

Aoun has said he believes Hariri does not have free control over his own movements while in Saudi Arabia, and that this casts doubt on any statements Hariri makes. Nevertheless those close to Aoun said the president welcomed Hariri’s comments.

“President Aoun expressed his pleasure at Hariri’s announcement of his return to Lebanon soon,” a source said.

Aoun said that Hariri was “leaving all doors open including rescinding his resignation”, according to one of a group of visitors who met Aoun. The visitors declined to be identified while discussing the closed-door conversations.

The visitors quoted Aoun as saying that Hariri’s remarks showed that the political deal underpinning Lebanon’s coalition government -- which includes both Hariri’s Sunni party and the heavily armed Shi‘ite movement Hezbollah -- still stands.

Aoun has been convening high level meetings with Lebanese politicians and diplomats since Hariri stepped down, and the visitors said the president believed that Hariri’s comments showed such efforts were working.

SILENCE FROM HEZBOLLAH

Nearly 24 hours after Hariri’s interview, which appeared on a TV station he owns, Hezbollah had still not commented on his remarks. Hezbollah’s allies in Iran said Hariri’s remarks gave hope he would return to Lebanon.

In his resignation speech Hariri, whose father, also a former prime minister, was killed by a bomb in 2005, said he feared assassination. He said in his interview eight days later that he was free to leave Saudi Arabia but that his movements were also guided by concern for his family’s safety.

Hariri’s Future Movement political party said on Monday it saw his plan to return to Beirut within days as a “good sign” and a step on the road to repairing Lebanon’s foreign relations.

In a televised statement, Future Movement lawmaker Ammar Houri said it supported Hariri’s statement that Lebanon should stay out of regional conflicts and reject Iran’s interference.

Saudi Arabia denies that it coerced Hariri into resigning or has kept him from leaving. It has accused Lebanon of declaring war on it because of Hezbollah, and has advised Saudi citizens to leave Lebanon. Hezbollah says it was the Saudis who have declared war on Lebanon.

It’s an awesome display of U.S. military power and reach, a reminder of Washington’s unparalleled ability to project global force. At the same time, however, it’s also a sign of how stretched those forces have become.

Getting three carriers to the Pacific has been an intrinsic part of Washington’s strategy to intimidate North Korea. But to do so required pulling forces from a host of other potential conflict areas, including the Gulf.

The ever-increasing demand for military resources in a growing number of places is causing increased concern in the U.S. military. In June, a report by the U.S. Army War College described America’s military clout as “fraying” and bluntly concluded that the era of U.S. global military primacy that followed the fall of the Berlin wall was over. America’s armed forces have a variety of strategies to tackle that decline but the truth is that coming wars will look very different from the sort of military deployments taken for granted in the recent past.

The change from a decade or so ago could scarcely be starker. In the aftermath of 9/11, America’s conventional military capability was narrowly focused on a handful of locations, primarily Iraq and Afghanistan. The resources plowed into them were stupendous – $5.6 trillion so far, academics at Brown University estimated this month. That would imply a cost per individual U.S. taxpayer of more than $23,000, including future care for veterans.

At their height, those wars dominated U.S. military thinking, planning and workload in a way that is hard to overstate. Working from Pentagon figures, the Brown researchers estimate that some 2.7 million American service personnel passed through those two countries in that time, more than half of them deploying more than once. Officially, however, these conflicts were never seen as endless wars – the hope was always that one last surge of troops would win the day and allow a larger withdrawal.

That didn’t happen, and U.S. military planners now assume there will be a substantial presence in Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries for years, if not decades, to come. Since the middle of the Obama administration, however, the Pentagon has quietly and comprehensively changed its approach to those wars, aiming for a much more sustainable “advise and assist” model working through local forces.

Speaking at the Association of the U.S. Army meeting in Washington in October, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley made it clear he expected such missions to grow substantially in the years to come. The success of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria demonstrates such tactics can work. But there have also been substantial failures and wastage, not least in Afghanistan where local security forces continue to struggle despite absorbing $70 billion of U.S. funding since 2001.

Much of the burden of U.S. operations in the last 15 years has fallen on a handful of special operations units, whose budgets, personnel numbers and deployments have all risen dramatically. They are now dangerously overstretched, and the U.S. Army is now looking to create more mainstream units to take on unconventional deployments.

With much of the fighting left to local forces, U.S. casualties are substantially lower. But as the death of four U.S. Green Berets in Niger last month demonstrated, putting troops far forward with less backup than they could call on in Iraq and Afghanistan means that when things go wrong, they go bad fast.

The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt leaves San Diego, California,October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Another awkward truth: In the last year U.S. personnel have been more likely to die in accidents than action, the result of a series of incidents including the high profile collisions of destroyers USS Fitzgerald and McCain. That toll suggests that even the parts of the U.S. military that have not been fighting wars are perhaps dangerously overstretched.

That’s been particularly true in Asia, where both the Fitzgerald and McCain were based. Tensions with China and North Korea have kept those units on high alert. In Europe too, heightened tensions with Russia have resulted in a scale of U.S. military activity unseen since the Cold War. U.S. troops, planes, ships and submarines are now on almost continuous exercises to reassure allies and track Russia’s increasingly active forces as Moscow probes NATO air and sea borders.

The Pentagon budget – $825 billion this fiscal year – is rising, and continues to dwarf that of any other nation. But it is also spread much more widely. China and Russia – spending $146 billion and 70 billion respectively – lack America’s global reach, but are more aggressively focused on their own immediate neighborhoods. Both have aggressively plowed resources into techniques and tactics such as cyber warfare and missiles that U.S. tacticians worry might give them the edge in any local war.

Some of that was expected – the Obama administration began its “pivot” to Asia in 2012 because of the perceived growing China threat. Much, however, was not – not least the speed with which North Korea has raced towards being able to strike the U.S. with nuclear-tipped missiles.

Washington’s military capabilities still dwarf anyone else’s. But it now faces a very real danger that its foes may be able to bleed it to death without ever confronting it in battle.",Commentary: The truth behind the U.S. show of force in Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apps-military-commentary/commentary-the-truth-behind-the-u-s-show-of-force-in-asia-idUSKBN1DD20A

Patriarch Beshara al-Rai heads the Maronite church, which has a presence in Lebanon, Syria and Cyprus and follows an Eastern rite of the Roman Catholic church. Maronites number about 900,000 in Lebanon, around a quarter of the population.

An official visit to Saudi Arabia by such a senior non-Muslim cleric is a rare act of religious openness for the kingdom, which hosts the holiest sites in Islam and bans the practice of other religions but says it wants to open up more to the world.

During his visit, Rai plans to meet Hariri as well as King Salman and his son and heir-apparent, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, both of whom he praised in an address to Lebanese living in Riyadh.

“Certainly his resignation surprised the Lebanese and saddened them and created a type of deadlock,” he later told reporters between selfies with followers. “We hope that with this visit we can speak about this topic.”

TOLERANCE AND CO-EXISTENCE

But Rai said his visit, which was planned before the latest crisis, was not political but aimed at boosting religious tolerance and co-existence in a region torn by sectarian conflict.

Hariri said in a television interview on Sunday that he was a free man and would return to Lebanon within days to affirm that he had resigned. He said Lebanon was at risk of Gulf Arab sanctions because of the Shi‘ite group Hezbollah’s regional meddling.

Asked when he expected Hariri to return to Lebanon, Rai said: “I wish tonight ... we hope as soon as possible.”

Hariri’s resignation and its aftermath have destabilized his country, where Sunni, Shi‘ite, Christian and Druze factions fought a civil war from 1975-1990, often backed by rival powers around the region.

Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics Ltd filed its patent infringement case against Apple in federal court in San Jose, California, on Monday.

Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, said its patented dual camera technology for mobile devices was incorporated by Apple in the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without its authorization.

According to the lawsuit, Corephotonics Chief Executive David Mendlovic approached Apple about a partnership. Apple praised the start-up’s technology but refused to license it, Corephotonics said, even suggesting it could infringe the latter’s patents with little consequence.

According to the complaint, “Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.”

An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

Many high-end smartphones include dual camera systems that can zoom in without losing image quality. Apple has its own patents on dual camera technology.

Through its latest funding round in January, Corephotonics raised $15 million from investors that included Samsung Ventures, electronics manufacturer Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek Inc.

Foxconn is one of Apple’s contract manufacturers. Apple is considering MediaTek as a chip supplier, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Corephotonics’ other investors include Magma VC, Amiti Ventures, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Solina Chau’s Horizon Ventures, as well as flash storage maker SanDisk and Chinese telephone services provider CK Telecom.

Corephotonics is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, the law firm that advised Samsung Electronics Co on its patent litigation with Apple.

Bitcoin tumbled in the second half of last week, falling as low as $5,555 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday, a slide of almost 30 percent from a record high just shy of $7,900 on Wednesday..

It rebounded on Monday, trading up more than 14 percent on the day at $6,718, though that was still more than $1,000 less than last week’s record high.

Market-watchers said the fall had been driven by a decision on Wednesday to abandon a planned software upgrade that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” - a move that had initially had a positive impact on the digital coin, sending it to a record high of $7,888 on the view that this marked a resolution of a long-term dispute.

But some were disappointed that “Segwit2x” fork had been abandoned. It would have increased the capacity of the “blocks” transactions are processed in, thereby reducing competition to get payments processed and lowering transaction fees.

Consequently, analysts said, some of those who see low fees as important to the future of bitcoin were selling it for a clone called Bitcoin Cash that spun off from the original in August. Its block sizes are larger, and therefore transaction fees are lower.

Bitcoin Cash tripled in value at the end of the week as bitcoin slid, reaching an all-time high just below $2,000 on Sunda and briefly overtaking Ethereum as the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency.

But traders bought back into the original bitcoin on Monday, sending Bitcoin Cash plummeting. It was trading down over 30 percent on the day at around $1,097, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

“Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will co-exist and serve different use cases, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s not a zero sum game,” bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antopolous said in a post on Twitter.

Bitcoin is up more than 500 percent so far this year.

He did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam before his last leg in the Philippines capital.

In Vietnam at the weekend, Trump and leaders of Pacific Rim nations agreed to address “unfair trade practices” and “market- distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape.

His “America First” vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that China now champions. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when Trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting American jobs.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told the summit in Vietnam that Asia-Pacific nations must “uphold multilateralism”, countering Trump’s message that the United States would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty.

The world’s largest retailer will start offering higher-end clothing and accessories from Lord & Taylor to its customers in spring 2018.

The partnership will allow Lord & Taylor to open a virtual storefront on Walmart.com and boost customer traffic to its website by reaching a wider audience. It will boost Wal-Mart’s online assortment with premium products and advance the retailer’s effort to access millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com.

“Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination within Walmart.com,” Denise Incandela, Head of Fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce told Reuters in an interview on Monday. She said Wal-Mart shoppers search the retailer’s website for premium items and the company aims to expand its online business with a focus on such products.

“This is a part of a larger business strategy where we are working to create a new Walmart.com,” Incandela said. She did not comment on the financial terms of the partnership.

In the past year, Wal-Mart has been acquiring small online fashion brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos in an attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon and others in the online fashion world.

Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales for that category exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.

But despite its store muscle, Wal-Mart has failed to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but due to its low-income customer base and brand perception, has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.

Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.

Virtual storefronts have become a strong e-commerce tool with retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) routinely offering dedicated space to brands on their website.

Virtual stores are also a preferred route for U.S. retailers to enter new countries where they don’t have operations.

Am Montag trafen CDU, CSU, FDP und Grüne erstmals nur auf Ebene der sechs Parteichefs und Verhandlungsführer, ergänzt nur um einen Spezialisten aus jeder Partei, um die strittigen Themen zügig zu lösen. “Wir sind jetzt runter vom Balkon und rein in den Maschinenraum. Wir müssen jetzt mal schauen, was der Motor wirklich zu leisten in der Lage ist”, sagte CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt vor Beginn der Verhandlungen. Nach wie vor gibt es zahlreiche Streitpunkte. Während sich Vertreter von Grünen und CSU skeptisch zeigten, gaben sich Politiker von CDU und FDP zuversichtlich, dass wie geplant bis Donnerstag eine Einigung erreicht werden könne.

Bis zum Nachmittag arbeiteten die Unterhändler die Themen Kommunen, Klima/Energie und Bildung/Digitalisierung ab. Die Themen Inneres und Soziales sollten ebenfalls noch am Montag behandelt werden. Ergebnisse sollen dann in die zuständigen Fachgruppen der Sondierungsteams gegeben werden, die daraus ein Konsenspapier erarbeiten sollen. Spätestens Donnerstag sollen diese Kompromisse dann abgesegnet werden. Aus Verhandlungskreisen war zu hören, dass die übrig gebliebenen Streitpunkte dann auf Chefebene endgültig beseitigt werden sollten.

FORTSCHRITTE BEIM KLIMASCHUTZ

Kleine Fortschritte gab es offenbar beim besonders umstrittenen Klimaschutz. Demnach haben Union und FDP den Grünen die Abschaltung von zehn Kohlekraftwerken angeboten. [nL8N1NJ507]. Für die CSU erklärte deren Generalsekretär Andreas Scheuer, die Sondierungen seien nun in eine konkrete Phase eingetreten. Für seine Partei gehe unter anderem um weniger Zuwanderung. FDP-Chef Christian Lindner forderte vor allem die Union auf, sich zu bewegen. Die Grünen pochten auf einen Kohleausstieg und ein härteres Vorgehen gegen Kinderarmut und Mietwucher.

Agrarminister Christian Schmidt (CSU) warnte davor, fest mit einer Einigung aller vier Parteien zu rechnen: “Das wird höchst, höchst schwierig.” Ähnlich skeptisch zeigten sich Grünen-Unterhändler, die beim Klimaschutz und in der Europa-Politik so gut wie gar kein Entgegenkommen ausmachen wollten. Positiv äußerte sich FDP-Präsidiumsmitglied Michael Theurer, der die Chancen für eine Jamaika-Koalition gestiegen sah. Ähnlich äußerten sich CDU-Politiker.

Steht bis Donnerstag ein Sondierungsergebnis, sollen nach Billigung der Parteigremien aller vier Verhandlungspartner die offiziellen Koalitionsverhandlungen beginnen. Als größte Hürde gilt der Grünen-Parteitag am 25. November, der der Aufnahme von Koalitionsverhandlungen zustimmen muss.

ENDSPURT IN DER NACHT ZUM FREITAG GEPLANT

Die Führungsrunde aus Bundeskanzlerin und CDU-Vorsitzenden Angela Merkel, CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer, die FDP-Unterhändler Lindner und Wolfgang Kubicki sowie Katrin Göring-Eckardt und Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir hatte am Sonntagabend in einer sechseinhalb Stunden Sitzung beschlossen, das Tempo der Beratungen zu beschleunigen. Deshalb will diese kleine Runde nun Montag und Dienstag viele der von den Fachpolitikern aufgelisteten Streitpunkte in den insgesamt zwölf Themengebieten lösen. Eine abschließende Runde soll es in der Nacht von Donnerstag auf Freitag geben.

Die Parteichefs hatten sich am Sonntagabend nicht auf ein gemeinsames Finanztableau einigen können. Die Union weigere sich, ökologisch schädliche Subventionen abzubauen, die Forderung der FDP nach Abschaffung des Soli lasse nicht viele Spielräume für andere Projekte zu, hieß es aus Teilnehmerkreisen.

Vor den Beratungen zeigten sich Politiker aller vier Parteien erneut unnachgiebig. Während etwa Özdemir erneut einen “geordneten” Kohleausstieg forderte, um die nationalen Klimaziele zu erreichen, widersprach CSU-Landesgruppenchef Dobrindt: “Einen Kohleausstieg, das ist vollkommen abwegig, den wird es natürlich nicht geben”, sagte er im ARD-Morgenmagazin. Sachsen-Anhalts Ministerpräsident Reiner Haseloff (CDU) betonte, dass es ein Milliardenprogramm für den Osten geben müsse, um den Kohleausstieg abzufedern und Strukturprobleme in den neuen Ländern zu lösen. Schließlich habe der Osten den Großteil der CO2-Einsparung seit 1990 erbracht. “Jetzt ist der Westen dran.”

Beim Knackpunkt Flüchtlingspolitik zeigten sich Differenzen in der Union. Während Dobrindt den CDU/CSU-Migrationspakt als unverhandelbar bezeichnete, deutete das CDU-Präsidiumsmitglied Jens Spahn Kompromissbereitschaft an. “Wer legal ins Land kommt, sich anpasst, Deutsch lernt, Arbeit hat und so beweist, dass er Teil dieser Gesellschaft sein will, soll auch dauerhaft bleiben dürfen und erleichtert die Möglichkeit zum Familiennachzug erhalten”, sagte Spahn der RND-Zeitungsgruppe.

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

The U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies: American Tower Corp, SBA Communications Corp, and Crown Castle International Corp.

The agreement announced on Monday shows that Verizon and AT&T, the No. 1 and No. 2 biggest U.S. wireless carriers, are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure better prices for the towers they use to transmit wireless signals, analysts and company officials said.

Both carriers are seeking to add to their network capacity at a time when consumers are using increasing amounts of cellular data.

Carriers are “always looking for alternative partners to lessen their dependence on the big three guys,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.

As part of the agreement, Tillman will construct the towers and AT&T and Verizon will serve as anchor tenants. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018.

“This is Verizon and AT&T working together with a new provider to put some competition into the mix,” said Susan Johnson, AT&T’s senior vice president of supply chain, in an interview, adding, “we do really hope this will be a future model.”

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

Insurers have said the growing sophistication of hackers alongside a still-evolving cyber insurance industry makes it difficult to quantify their potential cyber-related losses.

About three-quarters of cyber policies that Travelers writes cover up to $1 million in damages, while nearly a quarter cover between $1 million and $5 million, the company said.

“We manage our limits very closely,” Kunkel said.

Equifax Inc (EFX.N), which compiles credit information about consumers and assigns them scores, disclosed in September that cyber criminals had breached its systems between mid-May and late July and stolen the sensitive information of 145.5 million people. The hack is among the largest ever.

Regulation will also drive demand for cyber insurance, particularly in the financial services sector, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Monday.

“As the cyber insurance market develops, competition is likely to erode profit margins,” Fitch said.

Some insurers who ultimately enter the cyber market may lack underwriting experience and take on risks that could exceed their capital, Fitch said.

Events that could trigger large claims include cyber attacks on electronic grids and transportation systems, or hacks of large data storage clouds, Fitch said.

Insurer American International Group Inc (AIG.N) said on Oct. 26 that it was reviewing all types of coverage it offers to gauge its exposure to cyber risk.

AIG will start including cyber coverage as part of its commercial casualty insurance during the first quarter of 2018, Tracie Grella, global head of cyber risk insurance, said at the time.

The move would boost rates but also make it clearer how customers are covered if they are the victim of a security breach.

Many commercial insurers offer stand-alone cyber coverage, but it is not yet a standard addition to most other policies, such as property and casualty.",Travelers says it is in 'right spot' for cyber insurance exposure,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-travelers-cyber-insurance/travelers-says-it-is-in-right-spot-for-cyber-insurance-exposure-idUSKBN1DD22T?il=0

Derek Kan, who was previously an official at San Francisco-based ride services company Lyft Inc, was expected to win confirmation to be under secretary of transportation for policy.

Senate Republicans have said their Democratic rivals were stalling a number of nominees over a dispute over funding for the $24 billion “Gateway Program,” which includes building a new tunnel underneath New York’s Hudson River. At least eight other Transportation Department nominations are pending and other jobs vacant, including a top auto safety regulator.

In September, President Donald Trump met with top elected officials from New York and New Jersey at the White House over the fate of the Gateway Program deemed critical to northeast U.S. transportation, but Trump made no commitments to finance the project.

Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the committee overseeing the Transportation Department, accused Democrats of holding nominations “hostage” while awaiting “assurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund” the Gateway project.

“While no one questions the importance of this corridor, there are many other important projects that also are awaiting approval and funding at the Department. No project should get to cut the line based on the machinations of a handful of our” colleagues, Thune said.

A spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer declined to comment, but a Senate Democratic aide said Democrats were indeed holding up some nominations “because they want assurances from the Transportation Department that the Gateway Project will quickly move forward after it’s funded.”

In addition to confirming Kan, the Senate was due to vote on Monday on whether to end debate on the nomination of Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer, to be general counsel at the Transportation Department.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Bradbury was one of the principal authors of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” called the “torture memos” by critics. Bradbury defended his work in June, saying the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.”

He says he is “looking for the soul of the company again.” Now, some 100 days into the job, Flannery has categorically exorcised the ghosts of false expectations past by halving its dividend, reducing earnings guidance and questioning entire swaths of the company’s portfolio of industrial assets. Next up is GE’s board of directors.

That Flannery is asking “why do we exist?” is not entirely surprising. He is, after all, a man with many years ahead of him to make some hard decisions, fundamentally reshape the company Thomas Edison founded and rebase its share price for the hard restructuring ahead. By contrast, his predecessor Jeff “Two Jets” Immelt was fighting for time, struggling to justify what was already done and had been previously promised during his 16 years running the company.

But the about-face from Immelt to Flannery has outdone the usual kitchen-sinking that accompanies the passing from one chief executive to the next. It’s certainly a stark contrast from Immelt’s own handover from Jack Welch in 2001. And that has raised a key question for GE shareholders: How did the board allow Immelt to continue for so long without intervention? If it was so obvious to Flannery and many investors that GE was overspending on dividends, flubbing on acquisitions and committing to too many second-rate businesses, what were GE’s 18 directors thinking?

Flannery has already clarified that GE’s board is oversized, under-engaged and badly in need of a house cleaning. So perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Flannery’s 57-page slideshow on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup. GE will also create a new “finance and capital allocation committee” with increased oversight of the company’s acquisition and buyback strategy.

The composition of the new board will include, among others, a representative of Trian Partners, the activist fund manager led by Nelson Peltz. But he can’t be the only director willing to question the strategy, dig through the numbers and, where needed, prod Flannery to shift gears. The era of the all-powerful GE boss, with two jets at his disposal in case one breaks down, is over. That, beyond any numerical pledges, should be the most important statement to emerge on this investor day.

Credit Suisse traders improperly shared information to manipulate currency prices and benchmark rates, and took advantage of its electronic trading platform to trade ahead of known client orders, the New York State Department of Financial Services said.

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank engaged in “unsound conduct” from at least 2008 to 2015 by failing to control its foreign exchange business, the regulator said.

Credit Suisse said it was “pleased to have reached a settlement with the DFS that allows the bank to put this matter behind it,” and said it did not admit to any findings.

The agreement is the latest in a string of global regulatory settlements with big Wall Street banks over forex trading practices.

Rivals including Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays PLC (BARC.L), and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS.L) collectively paid $10 billion in 2014 and 2015 to settle probes by U.S. and European authorities that their forex traders coordinated to cheat clients and boost their own profits.

Since 2014, New York has been investigating whether banks under its aegis used algorithms on their trading platforms to front-run or otherwise manipulate foreign exchange rates.

Credit Suisse, like numerous other foreign banks, operates in the United States through foreign branches that are licensed and regulated by New York state.

Earlier this year, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay New York $350 million to settle similar claims, and Barclays paid $635 million in 2015.

The probe is still ongoing in relation to other banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In a statement, DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo blamed Credit Suisse’s conduct on executives who “deliberately fostered a corrupt culture that failed to implement effective controls.”

As part of its settlement, Credit Suisse agreed to improve its controls and compliance, and retain a consultant to review its remedial efforts for at least a year.

Like other banks, Credit Suisse foreign exchange traders used chat rooms to share confidential customer information, coordinate trades and try to manipulate currencies or benchmark rates, DFS said.

Through these communications, the traders were able to trade ahead of clients, or use a tactic called “building ammo,” with which they coordinated activity with other traders to ensure they were not taking positions that would hurt one another, the regulator said.",NY state regulator fines Credit Suisse $135 mln over forex practices,https://www.reuters.com/article/credit-suisse-gp-forex-settlement/new-york-state-regulator-fines-credit-suisse-135-million-over-forex-practices-idINKBN1DD2BN

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

In der venezolanischen Hauptstadt Caracas waren zugleich Gespräche der Regierung mit Gläubigern des ölreichen Landes geplant. Dabei geht es um eine Umschuldung im Volumen von 60 Milliarden Dollar.

Zur Begründung der angedrohten Einreiseverbote und Kontensperrungen in der EU verwiesen die Außenminister auf die Regionalwahlen in Venezuela am 15. Oktober, die trotz zahlreicher Unregelmäßigkeiten angesetzt worden seien. Den Ergebnissen zufolge gingen Maduros Sozialisten aus der Wahl als Sieger hervor, obwohl Umfragen die Opposition klar vorne sahen. Allerdings bemühe sich die EU weiter darum, den Dialog zwischen Maduro und der Opposition in Gang zu bringen, um eine friedliche und demokratische Lösung zu finden, sagte der spanische Außenminister Alfonso Dastis.

President Nicolas Maduro confused investors this month with a vow to continue paying Venezuela’s crippling debt, while also seeking to restructure and refinance it.

Both restructuring and refinancing appear out of the question, however, due to U.S. sanctions against the crisis-stricken nation. A default would compound Venezuela’s dire economic crisis.

Monday’s short and confused meeting, attended by senior Venezuelan officials blacklisted by the United States, gave no clarity on how Maduro would carry out his plan, bondholders and their representatives who participated said afterwards.

That means Venezuela remains with the dilemma of whether to continuing paying debt at the expense of an increasingly hungry and sick population, or defaulting on creditors and burning its bridges to the global financial system.

But bond prices maintained last week’s rally, with one investor saying there was relief the meeting did not include a default announcement.

“There was no offer, no terms, no strategy, nothing,” said one bondholder, leaving the meeting that lasted a little over half an hour at the ‘White Palace’, opposite Maduro’s office in downtown Caracas.

“It was a missed opportunity,” said another participant, also departing with a colorful gift-bag made out of recycled materials and containing Venezuelan chocolates and coffee.

The investors had entered via a red carpet and were greeted by a poster of Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez at the entrance of the meeting room inside, witnesses said.

About 100 investors, including some bondholders from New York, and lawyers representing creditors, had arrived.

Chief debt negotiators Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Economy Minister Simon Zerpa - on U.S. sanctions lists for drug and corruption charges respectively - attended for half an hour.

They met with some bondholders, while others stayed out of the room, witnesses said, as they were concerned about the consequences of meeting them. The U.S. has warned bondholders that they could face stiff penalties if they deal with sanctioned officials.

Participants said El Aissami gave a statement protesting unfair treatment by global financial institutions, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s sanctions aimed at preventing Venezuela from issuing new debt.

El Aissami described U.S. financial authorities as “worse than the Holy Inquisition,” one attendee said.

He also told creditors that Deutsche Bank may soon cut off some financial services to Venezuela, participants said.

Deutsche declined to comment.

Separately, the European Union approved economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Venezuela on Monday, although it has yet to name who will be subject to the sanctions.

HUNTING FOOD IN GARBAGE

Slideshow (9 Images)

Markets continue to remain optimistic that Venezuela will service its debts, noting it continues to make payments despite delays caused by increased bank vigilance.

It has made close to $2 billion in payments in the past two weeks, albeit delayed.

Bond prices were up across the board on Monday, with the benchmark 2022 notes issued by state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] rising 3.25 percentage points.

But some investors fear Maduro’s promise to restructure and refinance debt rings hollow, and that his government may in fact be paving the way for a default.

The economic implosion has already taken a brutal toll on Venezuelans. Citizens are increasingly suffering from malnutrition and preventable diseases because they cannot find food and medicine or cannot afford them because of triple-digit inflation.

The sight of poor Venezuelans eating from garbage bags has become a powerful symbol of decay. It contrasts sharply with the era of Chavez, when high oil prices helped fuel state spending.

Halting debt service would free up an additional $1.6 billion in hard currency by the end of the year. Those resources could be used to improve supplies of staple goods as Maduro heads into a presidential election expected for 2018.

But the strategy could backfire if met with aggressive lawsuits. A default by PDVSA, which issued about half of the country’s outstanding bonds, could ensnare the company’s foreign assets such as refineries in legal battles - potentially crimping export revenue.

Senate Republicans have said their Democratic rivals were stalling a number of nominees over a dispute over funding for the $24 billion “Gateway Program,” which includes building a new tunnel underneath New York’s Hudson River. At least eight other Transportation Department nominations are pending and other jobs vacant, including a top auto safety regulator.

In September, President Donald Trump met with top elected officials from New York and New Jersey at the White House over the fate of the Gateway Program deemed critical to northeast U.S. transportation, but Trump made no commitments to finance the project.

Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the committee overseeing the Transportation Department, accused Democrats of holding nominations “hostage” while awaiting “assurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund” the Gateway project.

“While no one questions the importance of this corridor, there are many other important projects that also are awaiting approval and funding at the Department. No project should get to cut the line based on the machinations of a handful of our” colleagues, Thune said.

A spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer declined to comment, but a Senate Democratic aide said Democrats were indeed holding up some nominations “because they want assurances from the Transportation Department that the Gateway Project will quickly move forward after it’s funded.”

In addition to confirming Kan, the Senate was due to vote on Monday on whether to end debate on the nomination of Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer, to be general counsel at the Transportation Department.

During the administration of President George W. Bush, Bradbury was one of the principal authors of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” called the “torture memos” by critics. Bradbury defended his work in June, saying the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.”

A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted a Trump administration request to block at least temporarily a judge’s ruling that had put the new ban on hold. Trump’s ban was announced on Sept. 24 and replaced two previous versions that had been impeded by federal courts.

The action means the ban will apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad who do not have connections to the United States.

Those connections are defined as family relationships and “formal, documented” relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. Those with family relationships that would allow entry include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States.

The ruling does not affect people from the two other countries listed in Trump’s ban, North Korea and Venezuela.

“We are reviewing the court’s order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay. We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said.

The state of Hawaii, which sued to block the restrictions, argued that federal immigration law did not give Trump the authority to impose them on six of those countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu ruled last month that Hawaii was likely to succeed with that argument.

Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the court’s decision tracked what the Supreme Court said in June when it partially revived Trump’s second travel ban, which has now expired.

“I‘m pleased that family ties to the U.S., including grandparents, will be respected,” Chin added.

Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, just a week after he took office, and then issued a revised one after the first was blocked by the courts. The second one expired in September after a long court fight and was replaced with another revised version.

Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Muslim militants. As a candidate, Trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Critics of the travel ban in its various iterations call it a “Muslim ban” that violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion.

The 9th Circuit is due to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 6. In a parallel case from Maryland, a judge also ruled against the Trump administration and partially blocked the ban from going into effect.

An appeal in the Maryland case is being heard on Dec. 8 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia.

Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.","For the hundreds of thousands of marchers thronging the palace-lined streets of Barcelona on Sunday, there was only one answer to the question about where storied Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, really belonged. “Viva España,” they chanted, waving flags emblazoned with regal lions and banners that read “We are part of Spain!”

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).
He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.
“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices.","(Reuters) - General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company’s shares to a five-year low.

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

Tanzanian President John Magufuli, has been accused by rights groups of cracking down on opposition. He denies the claims, saying his government respects democracy.

The Kigoma Ujiji Municipal Council in northwestern Tanzania run by a relatively small opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, has vowed to remain in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) as a sub-national member despite central government’s withdrawal.

But the government warned the leader of ACT-Wazalendo, Zitto Kabwe, in parliament on Monday that his party would lose the municipal council if it did not immediately withdraw.

“A municipal council cannot refuse to comply with a decision made by the central government,” Tanzania’s Good Governance Minister, George Mkuchika, said in parliament.

“If they (council) continue to communicate with OGP as they are doing now, the government will take stern measures ... which may include disbanding the municipal council. Don’t force us to go there.”

The East African nation joined the OGP in 2011 to promote transparency and accountability in government spending, but withdrew in July. It said it wanted to focus on participation in APRM, a similar peer review system for African governments.

The 75-member Washington-based OGP aims to secure commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.

The leader of ACT-Wazalendo criticised the government move.

“Forcing it (the municipal council) to withdraw...is unconstitutional because the central government is interfering in the affairs of local government,” he said in a statement.

Magufuli has been praised by some Western countries for curbing corruption and wasteful government spending since taking office in Nov 2015.",Tanzania threatens to dissolve opposition-run municipal council over transparency row,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1DD16T-OZATP

Credit Suisse traders improperly shared information to manipulate currency prices and benchmark rates, and took advantage of its electronic trading platform to trade ahead of known client orders, the New York State Department of Financial Services said.

Switzerland’s second-biggest bank engaged in “unsound conduct” from at least 2008 to 2015 by failing to control its foreign exchange business, the regulator said.

Credit Suisse said it was “pleased to have reached a settlement with the DFS that allows the bank to put this matter behind it,” and said it did not admit to any findings.

The agreement is the latest in a string of global regulatory settlements with big Wall Street banks over forex trading practices.

Rivals including Citigroup Inc (C.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Barclays PLC (BARC.L), and Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS.L) collectively paid $10 billion in 2014 and 2015 to settle probes by U.S. and European authorities that their forex traders coordinated to cheat clients and boost their own profits.

Since 2014, New York has been investigating whether banks under its aegis used algorithms on their trading platforms to front-run or otherwise manipulate foreign exchange rates.

Credit Suisse, like numerous other foreign banks, operates in the United States through foreign branches that are licensed and regulated by New York state.

Earlier this year, French bank BNP Paribas agreed to pay New York $350 million to settle similar claims, and Barclays paid $635 million in 2015.

The probe is still ongoing in relation to other banks, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In a statement, DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo blamed Credit Suisse’s conduct on executives who “deliberately fostered a corrupt culture that failed to implement effective controls.”

As part of its settlement, Credit Suisse agreed to improve its controls and compliance, and retain a consultant to review its remedial efforts for at least a year.

Like other banks, Credit Suisse foreign exchange traders used chat rooms to share confidential customer information, coordinate trades and try to manipulate currencies or benchmark rates, DFS said.

Anxious not to push Caracas any closer to economic and political collapse as debt restructuring talks begin, EU governments held back from targeting any individuals.

The bloc instead left names for a later stage to try to persuade President Nicholas Maduro to calm the situation.

“Everything we do is aimed at seeking dialogue between the government and the opposition to find a democratic and peaceful solution,” Spain’s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters at a meeting with his counterparts where the sanctions decision was made.

Venezuelan opposition leaders said last week they would resume efforts to hold a dialogue with Maduro, even though they say he previously used such talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform.

Over the weekend, Maduro had termed imminent sanctions by the bloc as “stupid.”

On Monday, his government said the “illegal” and “absurd” EU measures were a violation of international norms.

“The European institutions show their lamentable and shameful subordination to the U.S. government,” it added.

Spain has long pushed for sanctions on those close to Maduro, whom Washington accuses of installing a dictatorship and slapped sanctions on in July. But the EU has been divided over whom to target.

The arms embargo adds Venezuela to an EU list that includes North Korea and Syria, where European defense companies can no longer do business and to which the sale of any goods deemed as being used for repression are also banned.

Britain sold 1.4 million pounds ($1.83 million) worth of arms to Venezuela between May 2010 and March 2017, according to The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which lobbies to end arms sales to repressive governments.

“GRADUAL AND FLEXIBLE” SANCTIONS

In a joint statement, all 28 EU ministers said the legal basis for individual travel bans to the EU and the freezing of any Venezuelan assets in the bloc “will be used in a gradual and flexible manner and can be expanded.”

Representatives of Maduro’s government were due to meet investors in Caracas on Monday to discuss renegotiating $60 billion in foreign debt.

Some EU governments want to give former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the EU’s main envoy for Venezuela, another chance to try negotiations despite unsuccessful efforts in 2016.

But in the statement, ministers said regional elections held in Venezuela on Oct. 15 were a turning point that had hardened the bloc’s position, having taken place amid “reported numerous irregularities.”

The results appeared to favor Maduro’s ruling Socialists, while polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. In the end it won only a handful of governorships, according to the pro-government electoral board.

EU ministers will decide whom to target with sanctions at a later stage, but said they would focus on security forces and government ministers and institutions accused of human rights violations and the non-respect of democratic principles or the rule of law.

Experts say individual U.S. sanctions spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on Maduro’s policies and that oil-sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the Venezuelan government to change.","EU readies sanctions on Venezuela, approves arms embargo",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1DD0UN-OCATP

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

Using 3D technology, the Scan Pyramids Project allows visitors wearing headsets to take a guided tour inside the Grand Gallery, the Queen’s Chamber and other ancient rooms not normally accessible to the public, without leaving Paris.

“Thanks to this technique, we make it possible to teleport ourselves to Egypt, inside the pyramid, as a group and with a guide,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of Scan Pyramids, which on Nov. 2 announced the discovery of a mysterious space inside the depths of the Pyramid.

The void itself is visible on the tour, appearing like a dotted cloud.

“What is new in the world of virtual reality is that from now on you are not isolated but there are several of us, you’re in a group, you can take a tour with your family. And you can access places which you usually can’t in the real pyramid.”

While partly designed as a fun experience, the “collaborative immersion” project allows researchers to improve the technologies they used to detect the pyramid void and think about what purpose it may have served.

The pyramid, built in around 2,500 BC and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a monumental tomb soaring to a height of 479 feet (146 metres). Until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889, the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest manmade structure for more than 4,000 years.

While there are passage ways into it and chambers in various parts, much of the internal structure had remained a mystery until a team from France’s HIP Institute used an imaging method based on cosmic rays to gain a view inside.

So-called muon particles, which originate from interactions with rays from space and atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, are able to penetrate hundreds of metres through stone before being absorbed. That allows for mapping inside stone structures.

“Muon tomography has really improved a lot due to its use on the pyramid and we think that muography will have other applications in other fields,” said Tayoubi. “But we also wanted to innovate and imagine devices to allow the wider public to understand what this pyramid is, understand it from within.”

When looking through their 3D goggles, visitors can see the enormous stones of the pyramid as if they were real, and walk virtually along its corridors, chambers and hidden spaces.

The money is available because the country has beaten its 2017 bailout target for a primary surplus - which excludes debt servicing costs - of 1.75 percent of gross economic output, he said.

Tsipras came to power in 2015 promising to end austerity but was later forced to sign up to a new EU bailout, the country’s third, in exchange for more belt-tightening to keep Greece in the euro zone. He was re-elected and his term ends in late 2019.

His leftist-led government hopes that after seven years of crisis, Greece’s fiscal performance will help it emerge from EU bailouts in August 2018, when its current rescue package ends.

“For a second year, we are in a position to distribute a social dividend to the people who need it the most. Better prepared and more effective this year, we will be able to pay out an even bigger amount,” he said in a televised statement.

Last year, Tsipras unexpectedly announced that the state would pay out about 600 million euros to low-income pensioners, a move that angered the country’s international lenders.

This year’s handouts have been approved in principle by the lenders, who are reviewing Greece’s bailout progress. Their representatives are expected in Athens this month to resume talks on fiscal targets and on reforms.

“We (the institutions) have been discussing these ideas with the Greek authorities. The announcements seem broadly in line with these discussions, which have not been concluded yet,” an EU Commission spokesman said, adding that the proposals would be examined by the lenders.

Tsipras said about 720 million euros would be distributed by mid-December to 3.4 million Greeks as a one-off, tax-free benefit, based on income and wealth criteria and household size. The country’s population is about 11 million.

Another 315 million euros would be directed to pensioners, he said, to compensate them for “unfair” health contribution payments in 2012-2016, while 360 million euros would be paid to Greece’s biggest power utility, Public Power Corporation (DEHr.AT), to prevent electricity tariff increases.",Greece to distribute 1.4 billion euros to citizens hit by austerity,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-pm/greece-to-distribute-1-4-billion-euros-to-citizens-hit-by-austerity-idINKBN1DD2BO?il=0

Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.8 percent at $65.74 in early afternoon trading, while those of Broadcom were down 0.4 percent at $263.95.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price.

“We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.

The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters.

Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said.

Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.

Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal.

FILE PHOTO: Chevrolet Cruze chassis move along the assembly line at the General Motors Cruze assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. REUTERS/Aaron Josefczyk/File Photo

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

“I only help her with changing the brushes and putting them into paints but she does the rest by herself more or less. I praise her by saying ‘oh this is really good, or not so good’,” Richter said. “We have been together for 40 years so this is a family connection.”

Sandra arrived as a baby elephant at the circus where Richter grew up, as a seventh generation member of an acrobat family.

Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).
He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.
“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices.","(Reuters) - General Electric Co’s (GE.N) new Chief Executive John Flannery on Monday outlined steps that will turn the biggest U.S. industrial conglomerate into a smaller, more focused company, surprising some investors who sold the company’s shares to a five-year low.

Flannery’s plan to shrink GE’s multi-industry array of businesses was a reversal of the deal-driven empire building of his predecessors, Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, and potentially a milestone in the decline of the conglomerate as a business strategy.

Other companies that once emulated the GE model of spreading bets among diverse industries are now unwinding their portfolios as well, something Immelt also did throughout his 16 years as CEO, even as he made acquisitions.

Flannery said he will pare GE down to three core businesses: power, aviation and healthcare. He will keep Immelt’s strategy of building software to complement GE’s machinery, albeit with a narrower focus and reduced budget.

For investors, Flannery’s decision to cut both the dividend and the 2018 earnings forecast by half added up to a whole that was less than they judged GE be worth last week.

GE shares fell to their lowest level in more than five years as investors worried the years-long overhaul would not pare down enough expenses or generate as much cash as they hoped. They closed off the day’s lows, down 7.2 percent to $19.02.

“They need to cut more cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research. “GE is still a bloated company with duplicate costs up and down the organization.”

GE stock has effectively been dead money since September 2001, when Immelt took over, posting a negative total return even after reinvesting its juicy dividends. Once the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company, GE now has a market value of $168 billion, less than a fifth of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

”You have pessimism around its portfolio of businesses mixed with a pretty harsh cut in the dividend,“ said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. ”It took them years to get into this mess and it will take them several years to right the ship and get back into a stronger position.”

‘SOUL OF THE COMPANY’

Flannery, who took over as CEO on Aug. 1, said he was “looking for the soul of the company again” and would focus on “restoring the oxygen of cash and earnings to the company.”

He will cut its board to 12 from 18 members, and bring on three new directors early next year.

GE said it already has shed 25 percent of its corporate staff, meaning 1,500 jobs around the world, including some at its Boston headquarters. It is aiming to reduce overhead cost by $2 billion next year, half of that at its troubled power unit that sells electrical generation equipment.

The transition includes GE getting rid of at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means. GE will jettison businesses with “a very dispassionate eye,” Flannery said, keeping only units that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GE said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses, all of which were widely expected, closing factories around the globe. But it was vague about other disposals.

It plans to get rid of its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), only months after making the multi-billion dollar investment. Baker Hughes shares lost 3.2 percent.

Flannery offered no quick fixes for investors. He said power, one of the businesses GE would focus on, was “challenged,” but could be turned around in one to two years.

GE’s Digital unit, on which Immelt bet billions of dollars, would focus on selling apps to customers in its core businesses, Flannery said. He confirmed that the shift meant sales staff were being let go, as Reuters reported last week.

GE also will cut spending on the digital unit to $1.1 billion in 2018 from $1.5 billion in 2017. GE had previously said it would invest $2.1 billion in its digital unit in 2017, but that tally included money not tied to Predix, GE’s industrial-internet platform, GE said.

Flannery said there is “no retreat on the idea” of GE providing both applications and the Predix platform to connect industrial equipment to computers that can make machines run better. However, getting one of its key applications to run on Predix could take two more years.

Flannery added that some of its healthcare IT business, such as software for imaging and hospital staff scheduling, were still critical to the company and not likely to be divested.

DIVIDEND CUT

The dividend cut, to 48 cents from 96 cents next year, is only the third in the company’s 125-year history and the first not during a broader financial crisis. It is expected to save about $4 billion in cash annually.

“This dividend cut will be a major disappointment to GE’s (roughly 40 percent) retail shareholder base,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.

The cut will be the eighth-biggest dividend cut in history among S&P 500 companies, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices. GE also had the biggest cut when it slashed its dividend by $8.87 billion in 2009, Silverblatt said.

GE forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 a share, compared with its earlier estimate of $2 per share. Wall Street was expecting $1.16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Industrial free cash flow will total just $6 billion to $7 billion next year, up from an estimated $3 billion in 2017, but far below earlier targets of $12 billion for 2017.

GE said the weak power business had largely prompted the dividend cut and lowered earnings forecast. Demand for new power plants will remain slow through 2019, Flannery predicted.

But GE also was to blame, he said.

“We did not manage the (power) business well,” he said. “That’s a fundamental change we need to make and that’s going to take some time. This is not a magic wand.”

Saudi Arabia backs a grouping of opposition figures called the High Negotiations Committee (HNC) led by Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister under Assad. The HNC has represented the Syrian opposition at previous Geneva talks.

A number of other political opposition groups and figures backed by other countries including Russia and Egypt also exist.

It was not clear from SPA’s statement which Syrian opposition members would participate in the conference.

The kingdom, a leading backer of Syrian rebels, supports an international agreement on the future of Syria but maintains that President Bashar al-Assad should have no role in any transition to bring the war there to an end.

Assad, whose Syrian army forces have been backed by Saudi arch-foes Iran and Hezbollah, has made major gains against opposition forces and Islamic State militants.

“Based on the policy of the Kingdom in support of the efforts to establish peace and counter terrorism, and in response to the request of the Syrian opposition, an expanded meeting will be held in the city of Riyadh,” SPA said.

Talks set for November 22-24 aim “to bring its parties and platforms closer together and unite its negotiating delegation to resume direct negotiations in Geneva under the auspices of the U.N.”

Several rounds of U.N. talks in Geneva between the Damascus government and the opposition have made little progress.","Saudi Arabia to host ""expanded"" Syrian opposition conference",https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-saudi/saudi-arabia-to-host-expanded-syrian-opposition-conference-idINKBN1DD2DA

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

Offiziellen Angaben zufolge stieg die Zahl der Getöteten auf mindestens 332, mehr als 2500 Menschen wurden verletzt. Die Behörden rechneten damit, dass die Zahlen weiter steigen. Rettungskräfte suchten am Montag in den Trümmern eingestürzter Gebäude weiter nach Überlebenden. In viele abgelegene Ortschaften konnten die Rettungsteams noch nicht vordringen. Am Sonntagabend hatte das Beben der Stärke 7,3 die Grenzregion zwischen beiden Ländern erschüttert. Die iranische Erdbebenwarte registrierte rund 118 Nachbeben.

Allein in der iranischen Provinz Kermanschah starben einem Bericht der Nachrichtenagentur Isny zufolge mindestens 328 Menschen. Das größte Krankenhaus des Bezirks Sarpol-e Sah wurde schwer beschädigt, wie der Chef der Notfalldaten, Pirjhossein Kuliwand, mitteilte. Hunderter dort eingelieferte Verletzte könnten nicht versorgt werden. Im Irak kamen kurdischen Rettungskräften zufolge vier Menschen ums Leben, 50 wurden verletzt.

ANGST VOR NACHBEBEN

Vielerorts fiel im Iran und Irak der Strom aus. Aus Furcht vor Nachbeben flohen die Menschen trotz Kälte auf die Straßen und in Parks und verbrachten die Nacht im Freien. 70.000 Menschen sind dem iranischen Roten Halbmond zufolge auf Notunterkünfte angewiesen. Innenminister Abdolresa Rahmani Fasle sagte, viele Straßen seien noch unpassierbar. Es sei zu befürchten, dass es noch viele Opfer in den abgelegenen Dörfern gebe. Viele Häuser im Iran sind aus Lehrzeiten gebaut, die bei einem Beben leicht zerbersten.

Der US-Erdbebenwarte zufolge hatte das Beben eine Stärke von 7,3. Das Epizentrum habe rund 100 Kilometer südlich der irakischen Stadt Sulajmanija in der kurdischen Region an der Grenze zum Iran gelegen. Der Iran liegt auf mehreren geologischen Vererbungslinien und wird daher häufig von Beben erschüttert. 2003 kamen bei einem Beben in der Stadt Bam rund 31.000 Menschen ums Leben.

Die Erdstöße waren auch in der irakischen Hauptstadt Bagdad zu spüren. “Zuerst habe ich gedacht, es handelt sich um eine riesige Bombe”, sagte Madschida Amir, die mit ihren Kindern beim Abendessen saß. “Doch dann haben alle geschrien: Erdbeben.” Am schwersten betroffen war die Stadt Darbandichan im Kurdengebiet. Mehr als 30 Menschen seien verletzt worden, sagte der kurdische Gesundheitsminister. In der Stadt Halabdscha wurde ein zwölfjähriger Junge durch ein herabfallendes Stromkabel getötet.

Auch in der türkischen Stadt Diyarbakir berichteten Anwohner von Erschütterungen, selbst in vielen Teilen Israels war das Beben Medienberichten zufolge zu spüren. Der türkische Rote Halbmond will nach eigenen Angaben 3000 Zelte, Heizkörper sowie 10.000 Betten und Decken an die irakische Grenze bringen.

A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year - much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes.

U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas, along with wind and solar power. And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U.S. coal.

”We’re not planning to build any additional coal facilities,“ said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power, one of the largest U.S. utilities. “The future for coal is dictated by economics … and you can’t make those kinds of investments based on one administration’s politics.”

Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP’s capacity for power generation, a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030.

(For a graphic on coal production, demand and employment, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zKY1tQ)

The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends. As some energy experts have said all along, the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office.

A White House official did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents major U.S. coal companies.

“The government is no longer against us,“ he said. ”We now only have market forces to contend with.”

Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election.

The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; ended an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands; ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams; and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Now Trump’s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90-day supply of coal on site. The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants, a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable.

While the full impact of Trump’s coal policy could take years to understand, the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand, energy analysts and utility officials said.

“BACK 100 PERCENT”

Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation.

The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978. Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003.

“We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent,” Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016.

So far, progress has been limited.

U.S. coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year, to 790 million tons, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 2018 output is expected to decline.

The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51,900 in October, up about 2,200 since November 2016 - but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak, according to the Labor Department.

On November 1, Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet, saying, “It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!”

But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U.S. coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia, according to James Stevenson, a coal analyst at IHS Markit.

During the first six months of 2017, Asian countries took in 7.5 million short tons of U.S. coal, up 97 percent over the same period in 2016, according to the EIA.

That demand will soon fade, Stevenson said.

“We are not going to get a repeat of 2017,” he said of the spike in exports.

“OBSOLETE”

Forecasts from utilities and the U.S. government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound.

Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13,600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018. That follows a loss of nearly 8,000 MW this year and 13,000 MW in 2016, according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data.

By 2025, coal-fired power plant capacity will dip to 226,380 MW, down about 30 percent from 2011, according to EIA.

Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close, bringing the number of plants that shut, or plan to, to 265 since 2010 - a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain, according to the Sierra Club, which has campaigned against coal.

Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power - and not by environmental regulations.

Duke Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, has shut down more than 5,400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2,000 MW by 2024.

Over the next decade, Duke plans to invest $11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power - and nothing in new coal-fired generation, said spokesman Rick Rhodes.

A Nov. 2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - which has two of the largest coal producers in its district, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc - said coal-fired power plants “may eventually become obsolete.”

Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook.

Peabody expects a “modest number” of coal power plant retirements in the coming years, with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output, spokesman Vic Svec said. Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast.

Robert Murray, the chief executive of privately-held Murray Energy Corp - one of America’s biggest underground miners - said Trump could do more for the industry. The administration, Murray said, should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health.

But Trump’s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives, which have bi-partisan backing. And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so-called “endangerment finding” on emissions that is the basis of many fossil-fuel regulations, given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it.

Murray Energy, meanwhile, announced on Oct. 31 it will buy a 30.5 percent stake in a coal-mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources, LLC.

The deal might help the companies cut costs, but it’s unlikely to help workers: Murray said about 200 of 1,000 jobs in Utah could be lost.","A year after Trump's election, coal's future remains bleak",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-coal-revival/a-year-after-trumps-election-coals-future-remains-bleak-idUSKBN1DD0IA

Consumer price increases estimated at upto 15% per month are one big driver. BitCoin's other appeal in Zimbabwe is that it makes online shopping easier. Local banks have actually been blocking or capping some payments from consumers to companies outside Zimbabwe.

That's because the lenders themselves are running short of cash. In other words, people's money is sitting in the bank but they can't use it. And hyperinflation means that money is also decreasing in money while it sits there.

U.S. stock indexes made little ground. Some investors sought bargains after a few days of losses while others were put off by a dividend cut and weak financial forecasts at heavyweight General Electric (GE.N) which plans to radically shrink to focus on aviation, power and healthcare.

Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives’ bill.

“What the market seems to be focused on is if and when tax reform will be agreed on by Republicans in both the Senate and the House and how it’ll fare in Congress,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.

While senators and representatives are trying to reach a deal, investors can still hope, said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

“They’re still working through the math attached to the two plans. They still have to go through reconciliation but the fact the conversations are happening is a positive.”

The maker of Budweiser and Bud Light said on Monday that Joao Castro Neves would be succeeded on Jan. 1 by another Brazilian company veteran, Michel Doukeris, currently chief sales officer of the global business.

“Neves had been viewed as a potential successor to Brito. If Doukeris can deliver on growth in the U.S., this would boost his chances for the top spot,” Jefferies analysts said.

Other contenders identified by the analysts are David Almeida, chief integration officer, and Ricardo Tadeu, president of African operations.

Brito said it was too early to speculate on CEO succession.

“It’s up to the board to make that decision. But for me, I’ve been here 20-plus years and I’ll be here another 20.”

Brito said he had discussed the departure of Neves with him for nearly a year and that it was a “personal decision”.

Doukeris, a 44-year-old Brazilian citizen with Greek heritage, last year moved his family to New York, the de facto headquarters of what is one of Europe’s biggest companies with a market value of about $200 billion.

The biggest challenge in the coming years will be to lift sales in the United States, where Bud Light is the largest brand with 19 percent of the market but has been in steady decline alongside mainstream lager rivals as U.S. consumers increasingly embrace wine and spirits.

BEER SHIFT

When they do drink beer, they are choosing more unusual craft beers made by smaller producers or imported beers, particularly from Mexico.

AB InBev has sold less beer in North America each year since 2014, with a steep 6.2 percent drop in the third quarter of this year.

“People are trading up,” said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg. “I don’t think anyone is really hoping for dramatic volume turnarounds. Just stopping the bleeding is the hope.”

Sales volume for the U.S. beer industry was down 1.8 percent for the first nine months of the year and has been down for the past decade, according to Wells Fargo analysts. Per capita beer consumption is down 20 percent in the past 35 years.

Doukeris, who joined the company in 1996, has run its Chinese and Asia Pacific operations, helping to expand Budweiser globally, and launched its “High End” business strategy focused on growing imported and craft beers. AB InBev has acquired nearly a dozen craft beers in recent years.

Brito, who has run the company for 12 years, said the United States is the company’s most important market and that Doukeris is the ideal person to lead it.

The CEO cited Doukeris’s sales background, which differs from the likes of former U.S. chiefs Luiz Edmond, who excelled at cost-cutting, and Neves, who strengthened relationships with wholesalers.

“He’s very consumer-centric, he has a great commercial mind,” Brito told Reuters, adding that the company will focus more on category expansion and category management, approaches learned from SABMiller, which AB InBev bought a year ago for $100 billion.

SALES AND MARKETING FOCUS

Under Doukeris, analysts said they expected an approach that would prioritise pulling in consumers rather than pushing distribution.

Doukeris said “the real opportunities” are in how to better organise the portfolio for growth, adding that he would supplement a national strategy with identification of pockets within the U.S. where he could boost sales of Budweiser and Bud Light.

Separately on Monday the company announced five other North American appointments, including the promotion of Brendan Whitworth, a veteran of PepsiCo and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, to vice president of sales.

AB InBev shares closed little changed at 100.50 euros in Brusssels.

The company’s high-end strategy was launched in China and expanded to 22 countries while Doukeris ran the sales division, garnering the business more than $5 billion in global sales. But in September the unit announced a reorganization that included the loss of roughly 2 percent of its workforce, about 300 jobs.

Craft beer is off its double-digit growth rates but is still expected to grow at about 6 percent this year, compared with an overall beer sector that could be down as much as 1.5 percent, Susquehanna analysts said.

The U.S. cell tower market is currently dominated by three companies: American Tower Corp, SBA Communications Corp, and Crown Castle International Corp.

The agreement announced on Monday shows that Verizon and AT&T, the No. 1 and No. 2 biggest U.S. wireless carriers, are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure better prices for the towers they use to transmit wireless signals, analysts and company officials said.

Both carriers are seeking to add to their network capacity at a time when consumers are using increasing amounts of cellular data.

Carriers are “always looking for alternative partners to lessen their dependence on the big three guys,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.

As part of the agreement, Tillman will construct the towers and AT&T and Verizon will serve as anchor tenants. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018.

“This is Verizon and AT&T working together with a new provider to put some competition into the mix,” said Susan Johnson, AT&T’s senior vice president of supply chain, in an interview, adding, “we do really hope this will be a future model.”

Josh Hawley, a Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill in next year’s elections, announced at a press conference that he issued an investigative subpoena to Google. He expressed concern over the accuracy of the company’s privacy policy, allegations it misappropriated content from rivals and claims it demoted competitors’ websites in search results.

Google said it had not yet received the subpoena.

“However, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment,” spokesperson Andrea Faville said in a statement.

Google has come under growing scrutiny globally as it has become a top provider of online search, mobile software and advertising technology. But formal investigations have reached varying results in the last seven years.

Attorney generals of 37 states reached a $7 million settlement in 2013 over Google’s unauthorized collection of Wi-Fi data through its Street View digital-mapping cars. A Federal Trade Commission inquiry also prompted Google that year to agree to provide advertisers and patent licensees more flexible terms.

The FTC, though, did not bring the stronger antitrust charges that Google rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Yelp Inc sought. States including Ohio, Mississippi and Texas saw inquiries falter without substantive consequences.

Missouri’s Hawley said the FTC’s inaction created an opening.

“We are going to act to hold corporate giants accountable ... for the good of the people of Missouri,” Hawley said.

Asked at the press conference whether his senate candidacy played a role in opening the Google inquiry, Hawley said he acted upon his oath of office and desire “to get to the truth.”

He pointed to the European Union fining Google $2.7 billion in June for unfairly favoring links to its own shopping service over those from other e-commerce websites. Hawley said he was moved to act because of concern that Google is engaging in similar behavior domestically. Google is appealing the EU fine.

The other issue cited by Hawley may be tied to complaints from Yelp. The business reviews’ website wrote the FTC and the attorney generals of all 50 states in September that Google has copied images from its service without permission in violation of a commitment made to the U.S. antitrust regulator.",Google faces antitrust investigation in Missouri,https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-antitrust/google-faces-antitrust-investigation-in-missouri-idINKBN1DD2CD

Amazon said it will produce a multi-season series that explores new storylines preceding author J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the first installment in the famed fantasy trilogy.

Three movies made of the trilogy in the early 2000s, filmed in New Zealand by director Peter Jackson, garnered nearly $3 billion at the box office and 17 Academy Awards.

Amazon acquired the rights from the Tolkien Estate and Trust but did not say how much it paid for them. The estate, HarperCollins and the films’ distributor New Line Cinema will help Amazon produce the television series.

The project underscores a shift in Amazon’s video programming. Its studio started in 2010 with a focus on unique shows beloved by critics, such as “Transparent,” about a father coming out as transgender to his family.

That was a winning formula for attracting Hollywood talent, awards and buzz, though not Prime subscribers around the world.

Now, Amazon is looking for a dramatic show that could be a hit globally, much like HBO’s popular fantasy series “Game of Thrones.” It is going head to head with Netflix Inc, Hulu and others to bid for top content.

This puts Amazon in uncharted territory, with higher production costs expected.

Amazon justifies its spending on programming as a way to draw new sign-ups to Prime, whose members buy more goods more often from the world’s largest online retailer.

“Amazon Prime heads to Middle Earth,” Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a Twitter post.

Although “The Lord of the Rings” is the most famous work to emerge from Tolkien’s pen, he wrote much else, including prequel “The Hobbit” - also made into a movie trilogy by Jackson - and the denser “The Silmarillion”. The Amazon series will delve into some of Tolkien’s work that the movies did not explore.

As part of the merger deal agreed in March, Vodafone India and Idea are selling the masts they own separately from their Indus Towers joint venture. Idea’s share of the sale to American Tower will be 40 billion rupees, while Vodafone India will get 38.5 billion rupees.

The two companies have also said they will look at selling their holdings in Indus, the country’s biggest mobile masts operator with 123,000 towers, which is jointly owned with an affiliate of rival network operator Bharti Airtel.

Last month Bharti Infratel said it would consider buying out its partners in Indus Towers, where Vodafone has a 42 percent stake and Idea along with private equity firm Providence owns 16 percent.

India’s network operators are rushing to consolidate amidst a year-long price war sparked by the entry of new competitor Reliance Jio with a brand new 4G broadband network financed by the country’s richest man Mukesh Ambani.

Idea Cellular, part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate, on Monday reported its fourth straight quarterly loss, mainly due to it having to compete against Jio’s series of cut-price service offers.

American Tower, which agreed to take control of Indian masts operator Viom in 2015 for 76 billion rupees, has been steadily expanding its presence in India - the world’s second biggest wireless market with 1.2 billion mobile subscribers.

American Tower said the latest acquisition would be immediately accretive to its adjusted funds from operations per share, with the deal expected to be completed in the first half of 2018, subject to regulatory approvals.

Consistent returns in the longer term have also attracted private equity investors to the market, although in the near term mast operators will struggle to grow revenue as some of their tenant phone network operators merge or shut down.

Media reports have said KKR & Co LP, which along with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, already owns over a 10th of Bharti Infratel, the only publicly-traded mast operator in India, is leading a group of investors to take control of the company.

Canada’s Brookfield, which called off talks to buy a stake in struggling Indian network operator Reliance Communications masts arm, has said it is open to acquiring the business under revised terms, while it looks at other potential opportunities in the India.

IDEA‘S Q2 LOSS

Idea, the third-biggest Indian network operator by revenue and subscribers, said on Monday it suffered a net loss of 11.07 billion rupees in its second quarter ended Sept. 30, which compared with a net profit of 915 million rupees in the same period last year but was less than the 11.25 billion-rupee loss expected on average by analysts.

Revenue was down 20.3 percent on a year ago at 75.11 billion rupees, while average monthly revenue per user fell 6.4 percent from the previous quarter to 132 rupees.

Shares in Idea closed 3.8 percent lower at 93.35 rupees, while the Mumbai market index was down 0.94 percent.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an announcement on immigration reform in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S. on August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted a Trump administration request to block at least temporarily a judge’s ruling that had put the new ban on hold. Trump’s ban was announced on Sept. 24 and replaced two previous versions that had been impeded by federal courts.

The action means the ban will apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad who do not have connections to the United States.

Those connections are defined as family relationships and “formal, documented” relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. Those with family relationships that would allow entry include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States.

The ruling does not affect people from the two other countries listed in Trump’s ban, North Korea and Venezuela.

“We are reviewing the court’s order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay. We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said.

The state of Hawaii, which sued to block the restrictions, argued that federal immigration law did not give Trump the authority to impose them on six of those countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu ruled last month that Hawaii was likely to succeed with that argument.

Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the court’s decision tracked what the Supreme Court said in June when it partially revived Trump’s second travel ban, which has now expired.

“I‘m pleased that family ties to the U.S., including grandparents, will be respected,” Chin added.

Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, just a week after he took office, and then issued a revised one after the first was blocked by the courts. The second one expired in September after a long court fight and was replaced with another revised version.

Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Muslim militants. As a candidate, Trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Critics of the travel ban in its various iterations call it a “Muslim ban” that violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion.

The 9th Circuit is due to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 6. In a parallel case from Maryland, a judge also ruled against the Trump administration and partially blocked the ban from going into effect.

An appeal in the Maryland case is being heard on Dec. 8 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia.

U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, ruling from the bench in New York, denied a motion filed Oct. 26 by the federally appointed Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, according to a court official. The board wanted to install retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Noel Zamot as PREPA’s chief transformation officer.

The oversight board was created under the 2016 Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, which is charged with helping the island recover from a financial disaster that left it with $120 billion in unpayable debt and pension liabilities.

Zamot’s name was put forward as an emergency manager after PREPA was criticized for signing a $300 million, no-bid contract with tiny Whitefish Energy Holdings to lead power restoration efforts. The deal sparked an uproar over its provisions and the Montana company’s lack of experience with projects that big.

PREPA on Oct. 29 agreed to cancel the contract after Rossello urged that it be scrapped.

In its motion, the board sought the court’s approval “confirming Noel Zamot as PREPA’s Chief Transformation Officer (the ”CTO“) with all the powers of a chief executive officer reporting to the Oversight Board.”

However, Puerto Rico’s government believed the move was an overreach of the oversight board’s authority and forcefully opposed the move in a public meeting on Oct. 31.

The government’s liaison to the board, Christian Sobrino, said the appointment would essentially mean the board could replace any Puerto Rican government official, “maybe even the governor.”

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.

“The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe’s security,” May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London’s financial district.

“The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.”

The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations.

The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe.

Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU’s police agency Europol.

May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks.

She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions.

May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.

“We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,” she said.

May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace.

But Fink warned that some investors’ comfort with calm markets could lead to “a setback” or even “a mess” if trades betting on placid markets start to do poorly.

“Good markets, even good bull markets, have 5 and 10 percent corrections. We have not seen that,” said Fink, who spoke at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York.

“When you mention the high-yield market being a little squeamish last week, in the scheme of things, who cares? It’s fine, it’s natural.”

Global stocks edged away from recent record highs on Monday, after several days of price swings in markets from high yield to U.S. government bonds rattled a quiescent bull market.

Yet Fink said global markets remain on sound footing, where it is hard to see “a real setback economically,” despite concerns over a U.S. tax reform deal as well as investors who are profiting by betting markets will stay calm.

U.S. equity market volatility - the daily fluctuations in stock prices - has hovered near record lows for much of this year. That has pushed some investors to opt into a lucrative, but risky, trade using derivatives to bet that volatility will stay low or fall.

“The biggest risk that I see is this ‘benign confidence’ that volatility is not creeping up,” said Fink, whose company oversees nearly $6 trillion in assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager.

TAX BILL

The U.S. stock market is eagerly anticipating a final U.S. tax bill that is expected to reduce corporate taxes and push up their profits.

Fink, who reckons the tax bill will likely help BlackRock’s bottom line, said the Republican party-driven reforms could push up earnings but would not likely lead to dramatically higher levels of investment in areas such as employment and equipment.

“The question is, ‘Are business leaders motivated that much by tax? I think on the margin, yes, but it’s not overwhelming,” Fink said. “This whole idea of repatriation of cash that is going to stimulate the economy, I think that is entirely wrong. It will stimulate stock rallies.”

Fink also said he was concerned by a proposed tax law change that would make compensation for top executives above $1 million non-deductable for public companies, rules that would not apply to private companies.

He said he worried that it and similar steps could discourage companies from going public and hinder a strength of U.S. capital markets.

“We’re conveniently destroying some of the foundational strength of our capital markets,” he said. “If you do changes that make it more difficult to be a public (company) than private, think about the unintended consequences of that,” Fink said.

Global economic growth is high or improving in surprising places, from Japan to Europe and China, said Fink, who was especially complimentary of French President Emmanuel Macron.

“The Macron election truly had a meaningful impact on the psyche of Europe,” said Fink.

Fink was one of 21 global investment managers who attended a dinner organized by Macron at the Elysee palace in Paris last month where the 39-year old French leader promoted the sweeping pro-business reforms he implemented since his election in May.

The former investment banker has passed a reform of labor rules making hiring and firing easier, has cut corporate tax and scrapped a wealth tax on all but property assets.

He has also pledged to “relaunch” Europe in tandem with Germany, after years of economic and financial crisis, with his plans to bring France’s budget deficit below the EU limit of 3 percent being met with praise in Berlin.

Fink said on Monday the reforms have been “incredible.”

“You could see a path in which there could be some better focus and a path toward better eurozone unity,” he said.

U.S. stock indexes made little ground. Some investors sought bargains after a few days of losses while others were put off by a dividend cut and weak financial forecasts at heavyweight General Electric (GE.N) which plans to radically shrink to focus on aviation, power and healthcare.

Investors were waiting for any signs of compromise on U.S. tax policy after U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes a year later than a rival House of Representatives’ bill.

“What the market seems to be focused on is if and when tax reform will be agreed on by Republicans in both the Senate and the House and how it’ll fare in Congress,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.

While senators and representatives are trying to reach a deal, investors can still hope, said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

“They’re still working through the math attached to the two plans. They still have to go through reconciliation but the fact the conversations are happening is a positive.”

Jewish groups have called on the Polish authorities to condemn the message of banners with slogans such as “pure blood, clear mind” or “Europe will be white or uninhabited” that some nationalists carried at a march on Nov. 11 - the anniversary of Polish independence from Russia, Austria and Germany at the end of World War One.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators attended a march through Warsaw organised by far-right groups on Saturday, carrying flares and Polish flags, many chanting anti-migrant slogans.

The Independence March has become an annual event in recent years, separate from official ceremonies to mark the holiday, and has attracted many people apart from far-right sympathisers.

The government of the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) condemned the racist banners, but not the march itself. PiS won election in 2015 partly thanks to support from younger voters, who have increasingly embraced right-wing views in recent years.

“Extremely bad incidents have taken place,” Kaczynski said, calling the banners a marginal phenomenon and “disgraceful rubbish”. “Polish tradition - the one we invoke - has nothing to do with anti-Semitism, we are as far as possible from that, nothing to do with racism.”

He also said that tens of thousands of “decent” people had come to the march to express their attachment to Poland.

The PiS government refused to take in migrants mostly from the Middle East and North Africa under an EU relocation deal, arguing that it could put public safety at risk. The party enjoys the steady support of more than a third of Poles.

Poland was for generations home to one of Europe’s biggest Jewish communities, until nearly all perished in Nazi death camps during German occupation in World War Two.

The American Jewish Committee (AJC) lobby group urged Polish authorities on Monday to speak out against the far-right, saying it threatened “the core values of Poland and its standing abroad”.

Duda responded to the banners by saying: “There is no place or permission or in our country for xenophobia, there is no permission for sick nationalism, there is no place for anti-Semitism ... Such attitudes mean an exclusion from our society.”

Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said marches to celebrate Independence Day were important and should not be marred by “absolutely unacceptable” banners.

The 24-storey Grenfell Tower, a social housing block in a deprived area within the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was destroyed on June 14 in a blaze that left hundreds bereaved and homeless.

A criminal investigation is under way into the causes of the fire, while a separate public inquiry is also going on to establish whether there were failures in planning, construction, maintenance or other aspects of the tower’s history.

“The council and the government are failing in their duty of care to Grenfell survivors, evacuees and near neighbors every day,” said Emma Dent Coad, a member of parliament from the opposition Labour Party who represents Kensington.

In a report on housing and inequality in the borough, she wrote that most children displaced by the fire were still in emergency accommodation five months later even though it was unlawful to keep them in such accommodation for longer than six weeks.

The Conservative-run local authority, Kensington and Chelsea Council, denied that the slow pace of re-housing people was due to any failure on its part. A spokesman said the process was tailored to the bereaved and going at their own pace.

Of the 206 households from the tower itself and from nearby Grenfell Walk who needed new homes, 28 have moved into permanent homes while 49 have moved into temporary ones, the council said.

It said a total of 178 children were still in emergency accommodation, including living with friends, in hotels or in serviced apartments.

Dent Coad dismissed the suggestion that any of the families were still in emergency accommodation out of choice. She said she had visited many families and they were all desperate to move into a permanent home. The problem, she said, was that they were not being offered suitable homes.

“A lot of people are losing their minds,” Dent Coad said, describing visits to families in cramped hotel rooms where children had nowhere to do their homework and parents broke down in tears when they talked about their situation.",London authorities failing people displaced by deadly fire: lawmaker,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-fire/london-authorities-failing-people-displaced-by-deadly-fire-mp-idUKKBN1DD23Z

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an announcement on immigration reform in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S. on August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted a Trump administration request to block at least temporarily a judge’s ruling that had put the new ban on hold. Trump’s ban was announced on Sept. 24 and replaced two previous versions that had been impeded by federal courts.

The action means the ban will apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad who do not have connections to the United States.

Those connections are defined as family relationships and “formal, documented” relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. Those with family relationships that would allow entry include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States.

The ruling does not affect people from the two other countries listed in Trump’s ban, North Korea and Venezuela.

“We are reviewing the court’s order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay. We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said.

The state of Hawaii, which sued to block the restrictions, argued that federal immigration law did not give Trump the authority to impose them on six of those countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu ruled last month that Hawaii was likely to succeed with that argument.

Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the court’s decision tracked what the Supreme Court said in June when it partially revived Trump’s second travel ban, which has now expired.

“I‘m pleased that family ties to the U.S., including grandparents, will be respected,” Chin added.

Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, just a week after he took office, and then issued a revised one after the first was blocked by the courts. The second one expired in September after a long court fight and was replaced with another revised version.

Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Muslim militants. As a candidate, Trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Critics of the travel ban in its various iterations call it a “Muslim ban” that violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion.

The 9th Circuit is due to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 6. In a parallel case from Maryland, a judge also ruled against the Trump administration and partially blocked the ban from going into effect.

An appeal in the Maryland case is being heard on Dec. 8 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. The Maryland case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project.",U.S. court lets Trump travel ban go partially into effect,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ruling/u-s-court-lets-trump-travel-ban-go-partially-into-effect-idUSKBN1DD272

A report by a presidential commission that government raise spending on higher education saw muted response from markets, with traders saying it was short on detail.

The rand, which weakened after the presidency said it would release the commission’s findings at midday, was little changed after it was published.

It slipped to a one-year low on Friday amid reports President Jacob Zuma was preparing to introduce free higher education, which would put added pressure on public finances.

At 1120 GMT the rand was at 14.5200 per dollar having tumbled as much as 1.1 percent to session-worst 14.5425, its weakest level since Nov. 18 2016.

Government bond due 2026 also weakened. Yields on the paper climbed 14.5 basis points to 9.495 percent, its highest level since May 2016.

South African 5-year credit default swaps, a measure of the cost of insuring the country’s debt, hit a four-month high, stoked by reports of power firm Eskom’s financial troubles.

Eskom said it was not insolvent but was facing serious liquidity issues.

Treasury confirmed Michael Sachs’ resignation, saying he wanted to join the civil service in a different capacity.

Fin24 said Sachs resigned over interference by Zuma at the Treasury.

“The rumour that a senior treasury official has resigned is obviously the main reason the rand moved lower,” said chief dealer at Bidvest Bank Kumeran Govender.

“But they’re also reports that ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe is under pressure and that hasn’t helped either.”

Local news reported that Mantashe was facing calls to quit by some members of the party. The ANC denied the claims.

On bonds, Govender added that fund managers, particularly from primary dealers, were offloading debt ahead of a government bond auction on Tuesday where Treasury will increase issuance.

Senior currency dealer at Standard Bank Oliver Alwar said investors were jittery over the rumours of Sachs resignation and increased government spending on higher education ahead of visits to South Africa next week by ratings agencies.

“It’s looking more and more likely that we will be downgraded,” Alwar said.

First proposed in the 1950s and long resisted by Britain, European defense planning, operations and weapons development now stands its best chance in years as London steps aside and the United States pushes Europe to pay more for its security.

Foreign and defense ministers gathered at a signing ceremony in Brussels to represent 23 EU governments joining the pact, paving the way for EU leaders to sign it in December.

Those governments will for the first time legally bind themselves into joint projects as well as pledging to increase defense spending and contribute to rapid deployments.

“Today we are taking a historic step,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters. “We are agreeing on the future cooperation on security and defense issues ... it’s really a milestone in European development,” he said.

The pact includes all EU governments except Britain, which is leaving the bloc, Denmark, which has opted out of defense matters, Ireland, Portugal and Malta. Traditionally neutral Austria was a late addition to the pact.

Paris originally wanted a vanguard of EU countries to bring money and assets to French-led military missions and projects, while Berlin has sought to be more inclusive, which could reduce effectiveness.

Its backers say that if successful, the formal club of 23 members will give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling international crises and end the kind of shortcomings seen in Libya in 2011, when European allies relied on the United States for air power and munitions.

Unlike past attempts, the U.S.-led NATO alliance backs the project, aiming to benefit from stronger militaries.

The club will be backed by a 5-billion-euro defense fund for buying weapons, a special fund to finance operations and money from the EU’s common budget for defense research.

Members will also be required to submit national plans and be subject to a review system identifying weak spots in European armies with the goal of plugging those gaps together.

Many governments say Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 was a turning point, after years of defense spending cuts that left Europe without vital capabilities.

“This is a commitment for countries to do better together,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. “It comes at a time of significant tension,” he said, referring indirectly to Russia’s rising military reach and Islamic militants who have attacked European cities.

ROLE FOR BRITAIN?

Despite an Anglo-French-led EU defense integration effort in 1998, Britain blocked formal collaboration on military matters, wary of the creation of an EU army.

Defense integration was revived by France and Germany, with support from Italy and Spain, in a show of unity after Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016.

The EU had struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and in Africa over the past 20 years and were caught off guard by Russia’s Crimea annexation.

As the EU initiative, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation, has gained momentum, British officials have been pressing for involvement. Britain’s aerospace industry and its biggest defense firm BAE Systems (BAES.L) fear losing out, diplomats said.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson likened London’s support to Gothic architecture, saying: “We are there, like a flying buttress to support the cathedral,” he told reporters.

In a possible compromise, Britain may be able to join in, but only on an exceptional basis if it provides substantial funds and expertise.",EU signs defense pact in decades-long quest,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1DD0PU

Sweden survived waves of attacks in the second leg of their European playoff on a night of unremitting tension and drama at a stunned San Siro where the cheers turned to boos after four-time champions Italy were left to rue their spurned chances.

The Italians, who had not missed the World Cup since the 1958 finals in Sweden, had 75 percent of possession, squandered numerous opportunities and had penalty appeals turned down in their increasingly desperate search for an equalizer.

The Italy players, who along with their 69-year-old coach Gian Piero Ventura, are likely to face long inquests, collapsed onto the pitch in despair at the final whistle and even veterans such as Giorgio Chiellini were inconsolable.

The defeat brought the curtain down on the remarkable international career of 39-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who was making his 175th appearance for his country.

Sweden coach Jan Andersson admitted that his side had to cling on against technically superior opponents.

“We had no weapons left. We just had to sit there and hope that we could hang on,” he said. “We couldn’t do it in any other way, they are so skilful.”

Ventura, under fire for his team selections and tactics, made four changes to the team which lost the first leg and brought Jorginho into midfield for the suspended Marco Verratti.

It was a huge ask of the Brazilian-born player who had not previously played a competitive game for Italy.

Nervous and jittery, Italy struggled to find their feet in a desperately scrappy opening 20 minutes, but began to create chances down the wings with Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva.

Candreva had the first real chance when Immobile cut the ball back across the face of goal but he fired over.

The chances began to flow as Jorginho chipped the ball over the Sweden defense to release Ciro Immobile whose shot was partially stopped by Olsen and cleared away by Victor Lindelof as it was about to trickle over the line.

Andreas Granqvist made a superb tackle on Manolo Gabbiadini as he looked set to score and Olsen then denied Alessandro Florenzi after he tricked his way past Mikael Lustig.

Italy kept pressing after halftime but their attacks became more desperate as the game went on and the realization that they were heading for failure clearly weighed on their shoulders.

The world’s largest retailer will start offering higher-end clothing and accessories from Lord & Taylor to its customers in spring 2018.

The partnership will allow Lord & Taylor to open a virtual storefront on Walmart.com and boost customer traffic to its website by reaching a wider audience. It will boost Wal-Mart’s online assortment with premium products and advance the retailer’s effort to access millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com.

“Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination within Walmart.com,” Denise Incandela, Head of Fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce told Reuters in an interview on Monday. She said Wal-Mart shoppers search the retailer’s website for premium items and the company aims to expand its online business with a focus on such products.

“This is a part of a larger business strategy where we are working to create a new Walmart.com,” Incandela said. She did not comment on the financial terms of the partnership.

In the past year, Wal-Mart has been acquiring small online fashion brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos in an attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon and others in the online fashion world.

Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales for that category exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.

But despite its store muscle, Wal-Mart has failed to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but due to its low-income customer base and brand perception, has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.

Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.

Virtual storefronts have become a strong e-commerce tool with retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) routinely offering dedicated space to brands on their website.

Virtual stores are also a preferred route for U.S. retailers to enter new countries where they don’t have operations.

The Venice, California-based firm, whose March stock market debut was the hottest of any tech stock in years, reported revenue and user growth for the third quarter well below Wall Street expectations as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram.

Snap’s shares tumbled as much as 20 percent in after-hours trading, before paring losses to trade at $12.57. Snap went public at a price of $17 a share.

Snap has disappointed investors each quarter of its brief existence as a public company.

User growth in the last three months was well below what investment analysts expected. Daily active users rose to 178 million in the third quarter from 173 million in the second quarter. Analysts had expected 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company was launching the redesign after hearing for years that Snapchat was difficult to understand or hard to use.

“We are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,” Spiegel told analysts on a conference call.

The 27-year-old CEO said there was a “strong likelihood” the redesign would be disruptive in the short term, but said Snap was willing to take the risk for long-term gain.

Such a radical change so soon after an IPO is unusual.

Snap is not the only social media company looking to revive growth by changing its look. Microblogging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world, double the length of its iconic 140-character tweets.

Asked on the analyst call what Snapchat’s redesign would look like, Spiegel said the company had been studying the evolution of mobile content feeds such as Twitter streams and the Facebook News Feed and saw room for a “personalized content service.”

Spiegel said the company next year would also build more tools for people to share with broad audiences beyond their friends, the type of public broadcasting common on Instagram and Twitter.

“It seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time,” analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG told Spiegel on the call. He asked what led to the shifts.

Spiegel said Snap needed to evolve rapidly. “We’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” he said.

REVENUE MISS

Snaps’s third-quarter revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertisements, rose to $207.9 million from $128.2 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $236.9 million.

Average revenue per user rose to $1.17 in the quarter, from 84 cents a year earlier, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.30.

Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said revenue was affected by a shift toward a software-based auction system for selling ads - a method employed by Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google - which has driven down the average price.

The auction system hit revenue in the short term but “builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue,” Khan said in written remarks. He said Snap more than tripled revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses in the third quarter compared with the first half of the year.

Snap is far behind Facebook and Google in making its ad system accessible to small businesses and should move faster, said Greg Portell, a consultant at A.T. Kearney.

“I think they spent a little too much time being different,” Portell said.

Snap recorded a $39.9 million charge in the quarter related to excess inventory of its “Spectacles,” sunglasses with a built-in camera.

INVESTORS SOUR

Snap posted a net loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $124.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.

Wall Street had expected a loss of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Snapchat, popular among millennials for the bunny faces and floral tiaras that can be added to pictures, allows users to chat through a series of disappearing photos and videos. Users can also post images and videos as “stories” - ephemeral posts that can be viewed in chronological order and disappear after 24 hours.

Before the quarterly release, Snap’s share price was already down 39 percent from its close on March 2, its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook’s shares were up 32 percent over that time.

Facebook’s Instagram said in September that it had 500 million daily active users.

Bitcoin tumbled in the second half of last week, falling as low as $5,555 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Sunday, a slide of almost 30 percent from a record high just shy of $7,900 on Wednesday..

It rebounded on Monday, trading up more than 14 percent on the day at $6,718, though that was still more than $1,000 less than last week’s record high.

Market-watchers said the fall had been driven by a decision on Wednesday to abandon a planned software upgrade that could have split the cryptocurrency in a so-called “fork” - a move that had initially had a positive impact on the digital coin, sending it to a record high of $7,888 on the view that this marked a resolution of a long-term dispute.

But some were disappointed that “Segwit2x” fork had been abandoned. It would have increased the capacity of the “blocks” transactions are processed in, thereby reducing competition to get payments processed and lowering transaction fees.

Consequently, analysts said, some of those who see low fees as important to the future of bitcoin were selling it for a clone called Bitcoin Cash that spun off from the original in August. Its block sizes are larger, and therefore transaction fees are lower.

Bitcoin Cash tripled in value at the end of the week as bitcoin slid, reaching an all-time high just below $2,000 on Sunda and briefly overtaking Ethereum as the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency.

But traders bought back into the original bitcoin on Monday, sending Bitcoin Cash plummeting. It was trading down over 30 percent on the day at around $1,097, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.

“Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will co-exist and serve different use cases, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s not a zero sum game,” bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antopolous said in a post on Twitter.

There is a risk the civil service could run out of money unless the British government passes the bill in Westminster before the end of the month, Britain’s minister for the region James Brokenshire told parliament.

“Without further action there are risks that the civil service would simply run out of resources,” he said. “No government could simply stand by and allow that to happen.”

Irish Nationalists Sinn Fein and the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have shared power in Northern Ireland for a decade under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which ended three decades of violence that killed 3,600 people.

But Sinn Fein pulled out in January, complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner.

The latest attempts to form a power-sharing government in Belfast collapsed earlier this month when Brokenshire said he had no choice but to set a budget, a step towards direct rule from London.

Many in the province fear direct rule would further destabilise a political balance between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists that has already been upset by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

BELOW PUTIN AND XI

The survey, based on the responses of 40,447 people and conducted between Feb. 16 and May 8 this year, showed even deeper mistrust of Trump himself, with only 22 percent of those surveyed saying they had confidence he would do the right thing in world affairs, compared to 64 percent who trusted Obama.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The survey showed widespread disapproval of Trump’s signature policy proposals, with 76 percent unhappy with his plan to build the wall on the border with Mexico, 72 percent against his withdrawal from major trade agreements and 62 percent opposed to his plans to restrict travel to the U.S. from some majority-Muslim countries.

On the positive side, the survey showed that 58 percent of respondents had a positive view of Americans in general. And in many regions of the world, a majority or plurality of respondents said they expected relations with the United States to stay roughly the same in spite of Trump.","Image of the United States has plunged under Trump, survey shows",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-image-survey/image-of-the-united-states-has-plunged-under-trump-survey-shows-idUSKBN19I00F

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on. It’s not in that situation now,” said Senator Andre Pratte, an independent who was appointed by Trudeau in 2016.",Canada government facing resistance from Senate over pot law,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D32IK-OCADN

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

The company said the licensing partnership with Japan’s Funai Electric Co Ltd, which manufactures Philips N.V. televisions for North American, would place its operating system on Philips’ smart TVs.

Roku also said that it would give a $20 discount on its $69.99-priced streaming stick for the Black Friday weekend, and separately said its customer would get a free one-month trial of AT&T Inc’s streaming service DirecTV Now.

The barrage of news was well received by investors, who sent Roku’s shares jumping 28.5 percent to close at $42.71 on Monday. The stock hit a high of $47.49 earlier in the session.

The stock has gained 127 percent in heavy volumes over the past three days in a rally that was spurred by the company’s strong third-quarter report late on Wednesday.

“The price move was solely due to long shareholders bidding up ROKU’s stock price” and not due to investors covering their short positions in the stock, financial analytics firm S3 Partners said in a note.

S3 Partners said while the short interest in Roku has risen since its initial public offering (IPO) in late September, it has stayed relatively flat in November and isn’t likely to go up further due to the limited number of shares available to borrow.

Investors who sell securities short first borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the price to fall so they can then buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.

Roku, one of the first to make a device to stream content such as from Netflix Inc onto TVs, is now combating deeper-pocketed entrants such as Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc among others.

Still, up to Monday’s close, Roku’s stock has now more than tripled from its IPO price of $14 on Sept. 27. The stock debuted at $15.78 on the Nasdaq on Sept. 28.

Representatives Frank Pallone and Elijah Cummings cited FCC decisions that benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a media report last year that the election campaign of President Donald Trump struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.

“All of these actions – when taken in context with reported meetings between the Trump administration, Sinclair, and Chairman Pai’s office – have raised serious concerns about whether Chairman Pai’s actions comply with the FCC’s mandate to be independent,” the pair wrote.

Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August that Sinclair forces its stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.”

A spokeswoman for Pai said the “request appears to be part of many Democrats’ attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views ... Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.”

Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.

Sinclair did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, told a congressional committee last month, “All of our media policy decisions seem to be custom-built for this one company.”

Sinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.

The FCC is set to vote Thursday on Pai’s plan to eliminate the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market and make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market. Approval would make it easier for Sinclair to acquire more TV stations.

The FCC will also vote Thursday on Pai’s proposal to allow broadcasters to use new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, but it could force consumers to eventually buy new equipment.

Between scandals over sex, secret meetings, political donors and the royal family, the government is melting down.

British Prime Minister Theresa May and her deputy, Damian Green, in the House of Commons, Nov. 1, 2017. Green is fighting allegations of harassment and having “extreme pornography"" on his parliamentary computer. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS

The country’s own newspapers say so. On Thursday, The Times carried the front page headline “Brussels braced for fall of Theresa May’s government” – this before it has served half a year.

Where British journalism fails to convey the dimensions of the mess, foreign journalists oblige. Steven Erlanger of the New York Times told his Sunday readers in early November that the country is “heading to nowhere, while on deck, fire has broken out and the captain — poor Theresa May — is lashed to the mast, without the authority to decide whether to turn to port or to starboard.” The Irish writer Fintan O’Toole writes in the New York Review of Books that “Brexit is fueled by fantasies of “Empire 2.0,” a reconstructed global trading empire in which the old colonies will be reconnected to the mother country.”

The first of these, if finely phrased, is overblown; the second is absurd. No-one but a real fantasist believes the empire can be reconstituted, or wishes it to be. But schadenfreude is too attractive an emotion to pass up, an occasion to pay the U.K. back for its haughtiness to other countries it deems less well governed than itself.

The real question here is whether the May government can survive. And what happens if it can’t?

The current mess is the result of the workings of democracy, which decreed opening the gates to the barbarians. Barbarians are the forces which mainstream politicians try to keep outside the walls; now, they have forced an entry. In the United States, the invasion is led by Donald Trump: his barbarians are those who take seriously his calls to “drain the swamp” (of Washington) and “put America first” (by de-linking it from much of what is understood by globalization).

Britain’s barbarians have breached the walls of both major parties. Labour is now led by a group of far leftists, gathered round the figure of Jeremy Corbyn, a man who believes in the socialization of much of the economy, has supported and praised the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah and favors a call for the former Labour leader, Tony Blair, to be tried for war crimes. Corbyn and his fellow radical members of parliament were barely tolerated by the rest of their parliamentary colleagues, yet when he ran for Labour’s leadership in 2015, a sudden swell of support from mainly young party members propelled him, astonished, to the leadership. The barbarians had flooded in; the party’s unexpectedly good showing in the general election this summer confirmed they were inside the walls to stay.

The Conservative barbarians are those who hate Britain’s membership of the European Union. The parliamentary barbarian group – a minority – plagued the leadership: John Major, prime minister from 1991-1997, called them, unaware of an open microphone, “bastards”. Their strength forced David Cameron, prime minister from 2010-2016, into the fateful decision to put the issue of EU membership to a referendum. He lost, and so the victorious barbarians inherited the party.

It was not, however, one of their number who became prime minister. That was “poor Theresa May”, an unenthusiastic European Union remainer, who won the party leadership over two Brexiteer challengers, but who fully accepted that the people had spoken and Britain’s exit from the EU would be pursued.

In that pursuit, a sea of troubles has washed about her, and about the country. Many in her cabinet are not Brexiteers; they believe that exit is folly, and seek to extend the period of leaving the Union in order to give British business and finance more time to prepare for the new conditions. The three cabinet members most concerned with Brexit include Boris Johnson, the unpredictable Foreign Secretary, who differed sharply with the cautious chancellor, Philip Hammond, a Remainer, on the timetable for leaving. David Davis, the main negotiator with the EU on the terms of Brexit, was called stupid, lazy and “vain as Narcissus” by the former campaign director of the Vote Leave campaign, a supposed ally. The upper reaches of the governing party are murderous.

Negotiations are, in any case, going badly. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted on a rigid timetable which doesn’t suit the UK, while issues like the amount the U.K. must pay before leaving remains a block on progress.

The sea has been made much rougher by a growing sexual harassment scandal that led to the resignation of defense minister Michael Fallon. Damian Green, effectively the deputy prime minister, is fighting allegations of harassment and “extreme pornography” said to have been found on his parliamentary computer.

The scandals multiply, usually displayed at the top of TV bulletins and on front pages. A careless remark by Foreign Secretary Johnson may have prolonged the prison sentence of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British citizen jailed in Iran on spying charges by wrongly claiming she had been training journalists there. Lord Ashcroft, a major Conservative donor, was revealed in the “Paradise Papers” leak to have sheltered a large part of his wealth offshore.

He was not alone: both the Queen and her son, Prince Charles, were revealed by the leak as having benefitted from tax-free shelters.

In the same week, International Development Secretary Priti Patel was forced to resign when she was found to have concealed a series of meetings with Israeli ministers without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or the prime minister. Patel’s replacement – Penny Mordaunt – had to be, like her, a keen Brexiteer; May does not have the freedom to choose on the basis of competence, only on the basis of alignment.

The prime minister is clearly weak, and has been since nearly losing the election to Labour. The enormity of the task – of unpicking hundreds of regulations, laws and agreements while forging new trading links, staunching a retreat of the finance sector from the City of London, attracting new and keeping established investment and combating the Scots nationalists who continue to threaten another referendum on independence – calls for strength and confidence.

Neither is much in evidence. The assumption of weakness is such that speculation on who could follow May as prime minister is a daily game. Most bets are on Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary and former journalist – clever, agile and a keen Brexiteer, but inheriting the same gnawing problems with which May has been forced to grapple. Were the Conservatives to lose their thin majority in the Commons on a confidence vote, a new election would be ordered – with the far-left-led Labour Party, on present poll figures, favorite. The country would then be even more deeply divided than before.

This is barbarian rule, otherwise known as democracy. Tens of millions in the democratic world experience insecurity, stagnant incomes or fear of mass immigration – sometimes all of these. They have chosen to vote for barbarians because the civilized people were not, they thought, caring, or at least not responding. Deeply uncomfortable, even dangerous, as the effects are, the rules by which states which offer political choice live must respect these votes. And hope for civilization to win, even among the barbarians.",Commentary: Britain’s mess extends beyond Brexit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-brexit-commentary/commentary-britains-mess-extends-beyond-brexit-idUSKBN1DA2ON

Sweden survived waves of attacks in the second leg of their European playoff on a night of unremitting tension and drama at a stunned San Siro where the cheers turned to boos after four-time champions Italy were left to rue their spurned chances.

The Italians, who had not missed the World Cup since the 1958 finals in Sweden, had 75 percent of possession, squandered numerous opportunities and had penalty appeals turned down in their increasingly desperate search for an equalizer.

The Italy players, who along with their 69-year-old coach Gian Piero Ventura, are likely to face long inquests, collapsed onto the pitch in despair at the final whistle and even veterans such as Giorgio Chiellini were inconsolable.

The defeat brought the curtain down on the remarkable international career of 39-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who was making his 175th appearance for his country.

Sweden coach Jan Andersson admitted that his side had to cling on against technically superior opponents.

“We had no weapons left. We just had to sit there and hope that we could hang on,” he said. “We couldn’t do it in any other way, they are so skilful.”

Ventura, under fire for his team selections and tactics, made four changes to the team which lost the first leg and brought Jorginho into midfield for the suspended Marco Verratti.

It was a huge ask of the Brazilian-born player who had not previously played a competitive game for Italy.

Slideshow (7 Images)

Nervous and jittery, Italy struggled to find their feet in a desperately scrappy opening 20 minutes, but began to create chances down the wings with Matteo Darmian and Antonio Candreva.

Candreva had the first real chance when Immobile cut the ball back across the face of goal but he fired over.

The chances began to flow as Jorginho chipped the ball over the Sweden defense to release Ciro Immobile whose shot was partially stopped by Olsen and cleared away by Victor Lindelof as it was about to trickle over the line.

Andreas Granqvist made a superb tackle on Manolo Gabbiadini as he looked set to score and Olsen then denied Alessandro Florenzi after he tricked his way past Mikael Lustig.

Italy kept pressing after halftime but their attacks became more desperate as the game went on and the realization that they were heading for failure clearly weighed on their shoulders.

Wal-Mart is the world’s largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales for that category exceeding $23 billion, according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.

But despite its store muscle, Wal-Mart has failed to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but due to its low-income customer base and brand perception, has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.

Amazon leads the U.S. online clothing and footwear market with sales of $13 billion in 2016, up $9 billion from five years ago. It is expected to triple its share of the U.S. apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.

Virtual storefronts have become a strong e-commerce tool with retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) routinely offering dedicated space to brands on their website.

Virtual stores are also a preferred route for U.S. retailers to enter new countries where they don’t have operations. For example, Macy’s in 2015 said it would enter China with a virtual store on Alibaba and test demand in that market.",Wal-Mart partners with Lord & Taylor to expand online fashion presence,https://www.reuters.com/article/walmart-lord-taylor/wal-mart-partners-with-lord-taylor-to-expand-online-fashion-presence-idINKBN1DD2PV?il=0

The #MeToo march and rally followed a relentless series of accusations by men and women who said they were victimized by high-powered figures in the entertainment industry. But marchers said they also represented men and women who had been sexually abused as children and in other situations.

“I’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times throughout my life,” said marcher Tara McNamarra, 21, of Los Angeles. “It’s affected me in every aspect of my life.”

She said the march was cleansing after years of not being taken seriously about having been abused.

Women made up a majority of the crowd, although men made a strong showing of support.

Steven Murphy, 51, of Los Angeles, said he regularly witnessed sexual harassment while working as an accountant in the healthcare industry.

“I’ve had personal experiences of friends, of co-workers who were harassed, and nothing ever came of it,” Murphy said. “They were made out to be the guilty ones. They were pressured and harassed by the company for speaking out against assault and sexual harassment in the workplace.”

The marchers started at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, walking along the noted “Walk of Fame” until they reached the Los Angeles headquarters of news network CNN at Sunset and Cahuenga Boulevards.

Along the way, participants noted the stars of actors and producers accused of sexual harassment.

The allegations have inspired an online campaign, tagged #MeToo, that has encouraged men and women in all walks of life to reveal their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, often years after they occurred.

Among the most recent allegations, five women detailed sexual misconduct accusations against Emmy-winning comedian Louis C.K. in The New York Times on Thursday. He admitted to the misconduct alleged against him in a statement on Friday and apologized for his actions.

More than 50 women have said that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

Earlier this month, actor Kevin Spacey apologized to actor Anthony Rapp, who had accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. Spacey’s representatives said later he was seeking treatment.

Eight current and former employees of the Netflix TV show “House of Cards,” who were not identified, also have accused Spacey, the star of the show, of sexual misconduct, CNN has reported.",Hundreds join Hollywood #MeToo march against sexual abuse,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-metoo/hundreds-join-hollywood-metoo-march-against-sexual-abuse-idINKBN1DC0IA

The Anil Ambani-controlled telecom operator reported late on Saturday a quarterly loss of 27.09 billion rupees ($414.06 million), compared with a profit of 620 million rupees a year ago. Revenue nearly halved to 26.67 billion rupees, amid a price war started by upstart rival Reliance Jio, which is backed by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh Ambani.

RCom, as the company is widely known, also said in a securities filing over the weekend that it has missed interest payments on two outstanding domestic non-convertible debentures.

The loss and missed payments make a recovery for RCom that much harder and come at a time when there are doubts about a previously flagged debt-restructuring plan.

With net of debt of 443 billion rupees as of end-March, RCom is the most leveraged among listed Indian telecom companies.

After its previous plan to cut debt by selling towers to Canada’s Brookfield and merging its wireless business unit with rival Aircel fell apart, RCom came up with a new plan last month pledging to repay a total 270 billion rupees from new deals for its towers, infrastructure assets, and real estate.

It has yet to finalise buyers for any of the assets it is planning to sell.

As part of the latest plan, the company has said banks will convert about 70 billion rupees of its debt to equity under the central bank’s strategic debt restructuring plan.

The debt-equity conversion plan may, however, run into trouble as bankers and RCom are at loggerheads over treatment of loans which RCom has taken from its group companies, the Economic Times newspaper reported on Sunday.

The company declined to comment on that story, but pointed to comments from its Executive Director Punit Garg, who in late October said he was confident the strategic debt restructuring plan would proceed.

As part of the deal with banks RCom says it has won a reprieve on payments to lenders until December 2018.

Shares in the company fell as much as 14.2 percent on Monday and were down 11.4 percent at 0750 GMT.

Its overseas bonds also dipped on Monday, with RCom’s 6.5 percent bonds due 2020 indicated at 35/37 cents on the dollar. The bonds have trended sharply lower in the last six weeks as RCom’s woes have mounted.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.

“We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said.

Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple.

Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year.

Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer.

“Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters.

If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline.

Anxious not to push Caracas any closer to economic and political collapse as debt restructuring talks begin, EU governments held back from targeting any individuals.

The bloc instead left names for a later stage to try to persuade President Nicholas Maduro to calm the situation.

“Everything we do is aimed at seeking dialogue between the government and the opposition to find a democratic and peaceful solution,” Spain’s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters at a meeting with his counterparts where the sanctions decision was made.

Venezuelan opposition leaders said last week they would resume efforts to hold a dialogue with Maduro, even though they say he previously used such talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform.

Over the weekend, Maduro had termed imminent sanctions by the bloc as “stupid.”

On Monday, his government said the “illegal” and “absurd” EU measures were a violation of international norms.

“The European institutions show their lamentable and shameful subordination to the U.S. government,” it added.

Spain has long pushed for sanctions on those close to Maduro, whom Washington accuses of installing a dictatorship and slapped sanctions on in July. But the EU has been divided over whom to target.

The arms embargo adds Venezuela to an EU list that includes North Korea and Syria, where European defense companies can no longer do business and to which the sale of any goods deemed as being used for repression are also banned.

Britain sold 1.4 million pounds ($1.83 million) worth of arms to Venezuela between May 2010 and March 2017, according to The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), which lobbies to end arms sales to repressive governments.

“GRADUAL AND FLEXIBLE” SANCTIONS

In a joint statement, all 28 EU ministers said the legal basis for individual travel bans to the EU and the freezing of any Venezuelan assets in the bloc “will be used in a gradual and flexible manner and can be expanded.”

Representatives of Maduro’s government were due to meet investors in Caracas on Monday to discuss renegotiating $60 billion in foreign debt.

Some EU governments want to give former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the EU’s main envoy for Venezuela, another chance to try negotiations despite unsuccessful efforts in 2016.

But in the statement, ministers said regional elections held in Venezuela on Oct. 15 were a turning point that had hardened the bloc’s position, having taken place amid “reported numerous irregularities.”

The results appeared to favor Maduro’s ruling Socialists, while polls had suggested the opposition would easily win a majority. In the end it won only a handful of governorships, according to the pro-government electoral board.

EU ministers will decide whom to target with sanctions at a later stage, but said they would focus on security forces and government ministers and institutions accused of human rights violations and the non-respect of democratic principles or the rule of law.

Experts say individual U.S. sanctions spearheaded by U.S. President Donald Trump, while providing strong symbolism, have had little or no impact on Maduro’s policies and that oil-sector and financial sanctions may be the only way to force the Venezuelan government to change.","EU readies sanctions on Venezuela, approves arms embargo",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-eu/eu-readies-sanctions-on-venezuela-approves-arms-embargo-idUSKBN1DD0UN

A dispute over iPhone royalties left the U.S. chipmaker vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival. Settling could preserve Qualcomm’s independence – but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to the handset maker, or just surlier.

Qualcomm and Apple came to blows over royalties the chipmaker collects on mobile gadgets, most of which use its technologies. The actual payments aren’t disclosed, but analysts generally peg them at about $10 per phone. When Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and told its suppliers to stop paying these fees earlier this year, it helped push Qualcomm’s share price down by $10 per share, in subsequent months, to the $54.84 at which it traded last Thursday, the day before Broadcom’s interest was reported.

Settling might make the $70-per-share bid less compelling. Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year. If it agreed a lower rate of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit. Put this on a multiple of 10, and that’s worth about $16 billion – or roughly $11 per share. And that’s before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back.

Should Apple play along? It depends who the $905 billion smartphone maker thinks is a more malleable counterpart. Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan is open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should it prevail, according to people familiar with its thinking. The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal. Winning the good graces of boss Tim Cook might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant.

Whatever Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition. A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple. Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Tan could negotiate properly anyway. The maker may prefer its serfs smaller and more squeezable.",Breakingviews - Apple has deciding vote in Broadcom-Qualcomm deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-apple-has-deciding-vote-in-broadcom-qualcomm-deal-idUSKBN1D92LZ

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.

“The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe’s security,” May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London’s financial district.

“The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.”

The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations.

The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe.

Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU’s police agency Europol.

She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions.

May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.

Amazon said it will produce a multi-season series that explores new storylines preceding author J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the first installment in the famed fantasy trilogy.

Three movies made of the trilogy in the early 2000s, filmed in New Zealand by director Peter Jackson, garnered nearly $3 billion at the box office and 17 Academy Awards.

Amazon acquired the rights from the Tolkien Estate and Trust but did not say how much it paid for them. The estate, HarperCollins and the films’ distributor New Line Cinema will help Amazon produce the television series.

The project underscores a shift in Amazon’s video programming. Its studio started in 2010 with a focus on unique shows beloved by critics, such as “Transparent,” about a father coming out as transgender to his family.

That was a winning formula for attracting Hollywood talent, awards and buzz, though not Prime subscribers around the world.

Now, Amazon is looking for a dramatic show that could be a hit globally, much like HBO’s popular fantasy series “Game of Thrones.” It is going head to head with Netflix Inc, Hulu and others to bid for top content.

This puts Amazon in uncharted territory, with higher production costs expected.

Amazon justifies its spending on programming as a way to draw new sign-ups to Prime, whose members buy more goods more often from the world’s largest online retailer.

“Amazon Prime heads to Middle Earth,” Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a Twitter post.

Although “The Lord of the Rings” is the most famous work to emerge from Tolkien’s pen, he wrote much else, including prequel “The Hobbit” - also made into a movie trilogy by Jackson - and the denser “The Silmarillion”. The Amazon series will delve into some of Tolkien’s work that the movies did not explore.

“Amazon is committed to producing super high quality, recognized, branded entertainment,” said Wedbush Securities industry analyst Michael Pachter. “That’s a departure from shows like ”Transparent“ and ”Catastrophe.“”

“By definition this will be expensive,” he added.",Amazon to produce 'Lord of the Rings' television series,https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-com-lord-of-the-rings/amazon-to-produce-lord-of-the-rings-television-series-idINKBN1DD295

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday’s lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker’s Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the “n-word” by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for “not having a positive attitude.” He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union.”

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

Biden, who will turn 75 on Nov. 20, declined to seek the Democratic nomination for last year’s presidential election in the wake of his son’s death. He told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that he was not yet ready to enter a political contest.

”I honest to God haven’t made up my mind about that,“ said Biden, who is promoting his memoir on Beau Biden, who died in 2015 from brain cancer. ”Right now I want to focus on the book and I want to focus on winning the off-year elections.

“I‘m not closing the door,” said Biden, who added that he was in good health. But if he had to act right now, “I would say no because I am just working through a whole lot, I‘m getting there and I want to focus on the book.”

Biden served as vice president under Democratic former President Barack Obama for two terms but stood aside as the party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump last year. Biden had sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 and 2008 elections.

Trouble is Roger Federer was on the other side of the net and Sock’s magic moment proved in vain as the Swiss maestro spun a backhand winner past the stranded American.

Sock, the first American to qualify for the ATP Finals since 2011, felt Federer’s winner owed a little to luck -- not that the world number two needed much of that commodity to claim his 53rd career victory in the season-ender.

“It was a minor shank. I don’t know, it’s Roger I guess. He can do no wrong. Everything goes in,” Sock, who pushed the 36-year-old hard in a 6-4 7-6(4) defeat having dropped serve in the opening game, told reporters.

It was a fairly accurate description of Federer’s astonishing year in which, after a six-month lay-off at the end of 2016, he returned to win the Australian Open and Wimbledon to reach 19 grand slam titles.

His seven titles so far this season is his best return since he won eight in 2007 and few would bet against him matching that by winning the a first ATP Finals title since 2011.

Federer might have to find another gear on Tuesday, however, when he plays Germany’s Alexander Zverev who marked his ATP Finals debut with a 6-4 3-6 6-4 defeat of Marin Cilic in the day’s other Boris Becker Group match.

Not everything Federer hit went in on Sunday.

The world number two, who warmed up for London by donning a kilt in an exhibition match against Andy Murray on Tuesday, was not at his clinical best, even managing to net a close-range forehand when Sock had give up the point and turned his back.

Two stunning backhand in the opening game of the match in a packed O2 Stadium earned him the only break in a match in which Sock, and his atomic forehand, was always a threat.

Federer, the oldest qualifier since 1970, looked aghast as two break points went begging at 3-3, then another two at 4-4. Sock’s stoic resistance earned him a tiebreak but, having drawn level at 4-4 he double-faulted and Federer closed it out.

“Not a whole lot to hang my head about,” Sock said. “It was a couple of points.”

Six-times champion Federer won 29 of 32 service points in the second set but admitted it had been a tough opener.

“I had a tactical plan with my team. But very often in a first match like this, it gets thrown overboard and you’re just happy to be serving well,” he told reporters.

Sock is one of four first-time qualifiers here, having crept through the back door by winning the Paris Masters. Zverev arrived through the front door though having won five titles this year and he looked immediately at home on the big stage.

The world number three started like a house on fire, emulating Federer’s earlier feat by breaking immediately with a delicate drop-volley off a dipping return.

After taking the opening set Zverev lost his way, however, and Cilic bossed the second set.

Cilic led 3-1 in the third and was close to a double break only for Zverev to re-ignite, breaking in the sixth game with an exquisite lob even the 6ft 6ins Croat could not reach.

President Nicolas Maduro confused investors this month with a vow to continue paying Venezuela’s crippling debt, while also seeking to restructure and refinance it.

Both restructuring and refinancing appear out of the question, however, due to U.S. sanctions against the crisis-stricken nation. A default would compound Venezuela’s dire economic crisis.

Monday’s short and confused meeting, attended by senior Venezuelan officials blacklisted by the United States, gave no clarity on how Maduro would carry out his plan, bondholders and their representatives who participated said afterwards.

That means Venezuela remains with the dilemma of whether to continuing paying debt at the expense of an increasingly hungry and sick population, or defaulting on creditors and burning its bridges to the global financial system.

But bond prices maintained last week’s rally, with one investor saying there was relief the meeting did not include a default announcement.

“There was no offer, no terms, no strategy, nothing,” said one bondholder, leaving the meeting that lasted a little over half an hour at the ‘White Palace’, opposite Maduro’s office in downtown Caracas.

“It was a missed opportunity,” said another participant, also departing with a colorful gift-bag made out of recycled materials and containing Venezuelan chocolates and coffee.

The investors had entered via a red carpet and were greeted by a poster of Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez at the entrance of the meeting room inside, witnesses said.

About 100 investors, including some bondholders from New York, and lawyers representing creditors, had arrived.

Chief debt negotiators Vice President Tareck El Aissami and Economy Minister Simon Zerpa - on U.S. sanctions lists for drug and corruption charges respectively - attended for half an hour.

They met with some bondholders, while others stayed out of the room, witnesses said, as they were concerned about the consequences of meeting them. The U.S. has warned bondholders that they could face stiff penalties if they deal with sanctioned officials.

Participants said El Aissami gave a statement protesting unfair treatment by global financial institutions, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s sanctions aimed at preventing Venezuela from issuing new debt.

El Aissami described U.S. financial authorities as “worse than the Holy Inquisition,” one attendee said.

He also told creditors that Deutsche Bank may soon cut off some financial services to Venezuela, participants said.

Deutsche declined to comment.

Separately, the European Union approved economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Venezuela on Monday, although it has yet to name who will be subject to the sanctions.

HUNTING FOOD IN GARBAGE

Slideshow (9 Images)

Markets continue to remain optimistic that Venezuela will service its debts, noting it continues to make payments despite delays caused by increased bank vigilance.

It has made close to $2 billion in payments in the past two weeks, albeit delayed.

Bond prices were up across the board on Monday, with the benchmark 2022 notes issued by state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] rising 3.25 percentage points.

But some investors fear Maduro’s promise to restructure and refinance debt rings hollow, and that his government may in fact be paving the way for a default.

The economic implosion has already taken a brutal toll on Venezuelans. Citizens are increasingly suffering from malnutrition and preventable diseases because they cannot find food and medicine or cannot afford them because of triple-digit inflation.

The sight of poor Venezuelans eating from garbage bags has become a powerful symbol of decay. It contrasts sharply with the era of Chavez, when high oil prices helped fuel state spending.

Halting debt service would free up an additional $1.6 billion in hard currency by the end of the year. Those resources could be used to improve supplies of staple goods as Maduro heads into a presidential election expected for 2018.

But the strategy could backfire if met with aggressive lawsuits. A default by PDVSA, which issued about half of the country’s outstanding bonds, could ensnare the company’s foreign assets such as refineries in legal battles - potentially crimping export revenue.

But Fink warned that some investors’ comfort with calm markets could lead to “a setback” or even “a mess” if trades betting on placid markets start to do poorly.

“Good markets, even good bull markets, have 5 and 10 percent corrections. We have not seen that,” said Fink, who spoke at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York.

“When you mention the high-yield market being a little squeamish last week, in the scheme of things, who cares? It’s fine, it’s natural.”

Global stocks edged away from recent record highs on Monday, after several days of price swings in markets from high yield to U.S. government bonds rattled a quiescent bull market.

Yet Fink said global markets remain on sound footing, where it is hard to see “a real setback economically,” despite concerns over a U.S. tax reform deal as well as investors who are profiting by betting markets will stay calm.

U.S. equity market volatility - the daily fluctuations in stock prices - has hovered near record lows for much of this year. That has pushed some investors to opt into a lucrative, but risky, trade using derivatives to bet that volatility will stay low or fall.

“The biggest risk that I see is this ‘benign confidence’ that volatility is not creeping up,” said Fink, whose company oversees nearly $6 trillion in assets, making it the world’s largest asset manager.

TAX BILL

The U.S. stock market is eagerly anticipating a final U.S. tax bill that is expected to reduce corporate taxes and push up their profits.

Fink, who reckons the tax bill will likely help BlackRock’s bottom line, said the Republican party-driven reforms could push up earnings but would not likely lead to dramatically higher levels of investment in areas such as employment and equipment.

“The question is, ‘Are business leaders motivated that much by tax? I think on the margin, yes, but it’s not overwhelming,” Fink said. “This whole idea of repatriation of cash that is going to stimulate the economy, I think that is entirely wrong. It will stimulate stock rallies.”

Laurence Fink, founder and chief executive officer of BlackRock, Inc. speaks during the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York, U.S., November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson

Fink also said he was concerned by a proposed tax law change that would make compensation for top executives above $1 million non-deductable for public companies, rules that would not apply to private companies.

He said he worried that it and similar steps could discourage companies from going public and hinder a strength of U.S. capital markets.

“We’re conveniently destroying some of the foundational strength of our capital markets,” he said. “If you do changes that make it more difficult to be a public (company) than private, think about the unintended consequences of that,” Fink said.

Global economic growth is high or improving in surprising places, from Japan to Europe and China, said Fink, who was especially complimentary of French President Emmanuel Macron.

“The Macron election truly had a meaningful impact on the psyche of Europe,” said Fink.

Fink was one of 21 global investment managers who attended a dinner organized by Macron at the Elysee palace in Paris last month where the 39-year old French leader promoted the sweeping pro-business reforms he implemented since his election in May.

The former investment banker has passed a reform of labor rules making hiring and firing easier, has cut corporate tax and scrapped a wealth tax on all but property assets.

He has also pledged to “relaunch” Europe in tandem with Germany, after years of economic and financial crisis, with his plans to bring France’s budget deficit below the EU limit of 3 percent being met with praise in Berlin.

Fink said on Monday the reforms have been “incredible.”

“You could see a path in which there could be some better focus and a path toward better eurozone unity,” he said.

China’s “Singles’ Day”, on Nov. 11, kicks off nearly a month of discounts and promotions. The extravaganza means lots of free PR and huge transaction volumes for Alibaba, his $480 billion behemoth. For investors, the stunts will also illustrate how supermarkets, augmented reality and mobile payments fit in Ma’s “new retail” strategy.

Singles’ Day has quickly outgrown its U.S. equivalents, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year more than 140,000 brands on Alibaba’s sites will offer online shoppers discounts on everything from Prada bags to Mexican avocados. Analysts reckon transactions will surpass the staggering $18 billion Alibaba handled last year – although different pricing and return policies this year mean the numbers will not be directly comparable to last year’s, and in any case they say little about the group’s financial performance.

There will be gimmicks aplenty, too. Last year, a Pokemon-style AR game let smartphone users catch virtual cats in stores to win coupons. Alibaba also live-streamed a fashion show, with real-time ordering of clothes worn on the catwalk.

This year, Ma is keen to showcase his marriage of online and offline commerce. So nearly a million physical retailers and convenience stores will participate in promotions and use Alibaba’s cloud computing, payments, and delivery services. For example, store owners can borrow from his financial technology group, Ant Financial, while shoppers can “smile to pay” with an Ant app or try on clothes on an AR-powered mirror.

With Alibaba shares more than doubling this year, investors seem to have bought into the company’s move away from its “asset-light” origins to target a larger slice of China’s overall retail market.

Com o partido ameaçando deixar o governo e o presidente confirmando que fará uma redistribuição dos cargos de primeiro escalão, Araújo alegou, em sua carta de demissão, que não tem mais apoio do PSDB para continuar no ministério.

“Agradeço a confiança do meu partido, no qual exerci toda a minha vida pública, e já não há mais nele apoio no tamanho que permita seguir nessa tarefa”, admitiu ele, na carta.

Ao sair a primeira denúncia contra Temer, em maio deste ano, o deputado chegou a pedir demissão, no dia mais crítico do governo Temer. No entanto, foi convencido a ficar e aguardar a decisão do partido.

O PSDB tem ainda outras três pastas: Direitos Humanos, com Luislinda Valois; Antonio Imbassahy, da Secretaria de Governo, e Aloysio Nunes Ferreira, das Relações Exteriores.

A saída de Araújo deve precipitar um rearranjo na Esplanada dos Ministérios com o aumento de espaço de partidos do centrão, que, ao contrário dos tucanos, votaram praticamente coesos na rejeição das duas denúncias contra Temer.

O presidente resistia a fazer uma reforma agora, mas foi avisado por aliados que somente assim poderia ter chances de aprovar uma reforma da Previdência “enxuta”.

A expectativa de aliados é de que as mudanças na Esplanada sejam realizadas nas duas próximas semanas, a tempo hábil de se tentar votar a nova versão reforma no plenário da Câmara ainda este ano.

DISPUTA DE ESPAÇO

Nos bastidores, com a saída de Araújo, o PP é um dos partidos que pressiona o governo para ter o controle do Ministério das Cidades. O líder do partido na Câmara, Arthur Lira (AL), negou que a legenda esteja reclamando maior espaço na Esplanada.

Lira afirmou que a decisão de Bruno Araújo de pedir demissão pode “ajustar” o tamanho adequado das legendas da base aliada a fim de garantir um apoio “firme” para retomar a votação da agenda de reformas.

Questionado se a saída de Araújo pode acelerar o desembarque do PSDB do governo, o líder partidário disse que se trata mais de uma “questão interna” dos tucanos e que não cabe a ele comentar.

“Não é só a posição do Bruno, é uma rearrumação. Imagino que temos partidos que estão subrepresentados e outros superrepresentados e ministros que não representam voto nenhum no Congresso”, disse ele, que defendeu que o colega tucano, Antonio Imbassahy, siga o mesmo caminho de Araújo e deixe a Secretaria do Governo.

A expectativa é que, se o governo for contemplar o PP nas Cidades, o ocupante do partido não seja um parlamentar que vá disputar as eleições no próximo ano. Isso porque, se entrar agora, terá de deixar o Ministério em abril, prazo para que os candidatos a cargos eletivos têm para se desincompatibilizar.

Dessa forma, o líder do governo na Câmara, Aguinaldo Ribeiro (PB), ex-ministro das Cidades, não deverá voltar à Esplanada por ser candidato à reeleição.

Nesse cenário, o presidente da Caixa Econômica Federal, Gilberto Occhi, que já foi titular da pasta, é um dos nomes cotados para assumir o ministério mais uma vez. Occhi é mencionado pelo empresário Lúcio Funaro, em delação, de que teria, quando ocupou anteriormente cargo na Caixa, uma meta para distribuir propinas a membros do PP. Ele já negou em nota ter cometido qualquer irregularidade.

Um dos vice-líderes do governo na Câmara, Beto Mansur (PRB-SP), disse que o PP já tem um bom espaço na Esplanada e reconheceu que o governo não tem como atender a todo mundo. Ele defendeu que se resolva a questão dos espaços da base “rapidamente”.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an announcement on immigration reform in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, U.S. on August 2, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted a Trump administration request to block at least temporarily a judge’s ruling that had put the new ban on hold. Trump’s ban was announced on Sept. 24 and replaced two previous versions that had been impeded by federal courts.

The action means the ban will apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad who do not have connections to the United States.

Those connections are defined as family relationships and “formal, documented” relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. Those with family relationships that would allow entry include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States.

The ruling does not affect people from the two other countries listed in Trump’s ban, North Korea and Venezuela.

“We are reviewing the court’s order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay. We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” Justice Department spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said.

The state of Hawaii, which sued to block the restrictions, argued that federal immigration law did not give Trump the authority to impose them on six of those countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu ruled last month that Hawaii was likely to succeed with that argument.

Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the court’s decision tracked what the Supreme Court said in June when it partially revived Trump’s second travel ban, which has now expired.

“I‘m pleased that family ties to the U.S., including grandparents, will be respected,” Chin added.

Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, just a week after he took office, and then issued a revised one after the first was blocked by the courts. The second one expired in September after a long court fight and was replaced with another revised version.

Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Muslim militants. As a candidate, Trump had promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”

Critics of the travel ban in its various iterations call it a “Muslim ban” that violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion.

The 9th Circuit is due to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 6. In a parallel case from Maryland, a judge also ruled against the Trump administration and partially blocked the ban from going into effect.

An appeal in the Maryland case is being heard on Dec. 8 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia.

L'amministratore delegato del Milan Marco Fassone assieme all'allenatore Vincenzo Montella REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo

Lo ha detto nel corso dell‘assemblea degli azionisti l‘amministratore delegato Marco Fassone, secondo due soci presenti all‘incontro.

Nell‘ambito dell‘operazione di acquisizione del 99,93% del club rossonero da Fininvest, Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg -- la holding che controlla il Milan, facente capo all‘imprenditore cinese Li Yonghong -- ha ricevuto finanziamenti per 180 milioni di euro dal fondo Usa.

Quest‘ultimo ha inoltre sottoscritto due bond, emessi dal Milan, per un importo complessivo di 128 milioni di euro. L‘importo totale da rifinanziare è quindi 308 milioni di euro.

Il tasso d‘interesse medio dei prestiti erogati da Elliott -- tutti in scadenza ad ottobre 2018 -- è di poco inferiore al 10%. Il Milan è stato dato in pegno a garanzia dei finanziamenti ricevuti e se gli impegni non venissero rispettati, Elliott, in base agli accordi, diverrebbe il proprietario del club.

Fassone, hanno spiegato i soci al termine dell‘assemblea, non ha reso noto il nome del soggetto che potrebbe subentrare al fondo statunitense, garantendo condizioni più favorevoli delle attuali, sia in termini di durata, del tasso e dei covenant, che attualmente vengono verificati ogni due mesi.

Più fonti spiegano che al momento sarebbero fuori dalla partita rifinanziamento Goldman Sachs e Merrill Lynch, le due banche d‘affari che nelle scorse settimane persone vicine alla situazione avevano dato in corsa per subentrare ad Elliott.

AUMENTO CAPITALE: VERSAMENTI LI IN LINEA AD ESIGENZE

Finora, ha comunque rassicurato durante l‘assemblea da lui presieduta l‘avvocato Roberto Cappelli, membro del cda, il nuovo socio di maggioranza ha provveduto ad effettuare versamenti per 49 milioni di euro nell‘ambito dell‘aumento di capitale da circa 60 milioni, in misura perfettamente in linea con le esigenze finanziarie della società.

Oltre alla tranche finale, Li potrebbe dover sottoscrivere un nuovo aumento di capitale dell‘importo massimo di 60 milioni di euro, per il quale il cda ha già ricevuto la delega, che con buona probabilità verrà esercitata, visto che il Milan chiuderà l‘esercizio 2017/2018 in rosso, alla luce degli ingenti investimenti effettuati sul mercato e l‘incremento del monte ingaggi.

Il rendiconto approvato oggi ha certificato una perdita di 32,6 milioni di euro a livello consolidato contro 34,2 milioni di euro di rosso del primo semestre 2016, anno chiusosi con un passivo di circa 75 milioni.

Il bilancio copre solo sei mesi per la decisione del management di effettuare il passaggio dell‘esercizio sociale dall‘anno solare adottato nell‘era Fininvest alla stagione sportiva, cioè dal 1°luglio al 30 giugno dell‘anno successivo.

RICAVI DALLA CINA PER ORA INFERIORI AD ATTESE

I primi tre mesi dell‘esercizio in corso, ha anticipato Fassone, hanno mostrato un aumento dei ricavi superiore alle aspettative, con l‘eccezione di quelli relativi alle attività commerciali in Cina, imputabile, secondo il management, ai ritardi burocratici dell‘avviamento del business.

Parlando con i piccoli soci, inoltre, l‘AD rossonero ha spiegato che la società prevede di raggiungere il breakeven al terzo anno di gestione, ha ribadito la possibilità di uno sbarco in Borsa su una piazza asiatica nel 2020 ed ha espresso fiducia nei confronti della decisione Uefa sulla proposta di voluntary agreement, presentata la settimana scorsa dal Milan, per derogare alla norme sul fair play finanziario.

La risposta dell‘organismo che governa il calcio europeo è attesa entro Natale. Nei piani presentati all‘Uefa non è previsto uno stadio di proprietà, che però resta un obiettivo di medio termine, ha assicurato l‘AD.

La società rossonera preferirebbe restare a San Siro, impianto del Comune di Milano, attualmente condiviso con i cugini dell‘Inter, anch‘essi interessati ad un utilizzo esclusivo. Sono state perciò avviate le prime ricerche per altre possibili soluzioni. Sarà annunciato all‘inizio dell‘anno il nuovo sponsor tecnico che subentrerà ad Adidas.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Trump was speaking in Vietnam, which has become the most vocal opponent of China's claims and its construction and militarization of artificial islands in the sea. About $3-trillion in goods passes through the sea each year. ""If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know,"" Trump said in comments at a meeting in Hanoi with Vietnam's president, Tran Dai Quang.

Vietnam has reclaimed land around reefs and islets, but on nowhere near the same scale as China. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims in the sea. Since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has grown closer to China, Vietnam has emerged as China's main challenger in the region. In July, China pressured Vietnam to stop oil drilling in a disputed area, taking relations to a low. Relations have since improved and Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting Hanoi later on Sunday.

He had nothing against the Republic of Niger, let alone the United States of America. His quarrel was with rival Tuareg cattle raiders.

Yet on Oct. 4 this year, he led dozens of militants allied to Islamic State in a deadly assault against allied U.S.-Niger forces, killing four soldiers from each nation and demonstrating how dangerous the West’s mission in the Sahel has become.

The incident sparked calls in Washington for public hearings into the presence of U.S. troops. A Pentagon probe is due to be completed in January.

Asked by Reuters to talk about Chefou, Nigerien Defence Minister Kalla Mountari’s face fell.

“He is a terrorist, a bandit, someone who intends to harm to Niger,” he said at his office in the Nigerien capital Niamey earlier this month.

“We are tracking him, we are seeking him out, and if he ever sets foot in Niger again he will be neutralised.”

Like most gunmen in so-called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, which operates along the sand-swept borderlands where Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso meet, Chefou used to be an ordinary Fulani pastoralist with little interest in jihad, several government sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The transition of Chefou and men like him from vigilantes protecting their cows to jihadists capable of carrying out complex attacks is a story Western powers would do well to heed, as their pursuit of violent extremism in West Africa becomes ever more enmeshed in long-standing ethnic and clan conflicts.

For now, analysts say the local IS affiliate remains small, at fewer than 80 fighters. But that was also the case at first with al Qaeda-linked factions before they tapped into local grievances to expand their influence in Mali in 2012.

The United Nations this week released a report showing how IS in northern Somalia has grown to around 200 fighters from just a few dozen last year.

The U.S. military has ramped up its presence in Niger, and other neighbouring countries, in recent years as it fears poverty, corruption and weak states mean the region is ripe for the spread of extremist groups.

GENESIS OF A JIHAD

For centuries the Tuareg and Fulani have lived as nomads herding animals and trading - Tuareg mostly across the dunes and oases of the Sahara and the Fulani mostly in the Sahel, a vast band of semi-arid scrubland that stretches from Senegal to Sudan beneath it.

Some have managed to become relatively wealthy, accumulating vast herds. But they have always stayed separate from the modern nation-states that have formed around them.

Though they largely lived peacefully side-by-side, arguments occasionally flared, usually over scarce watering points. A steady increase in the availability of automatic weapons over the years has made the rivalry ever more deadly.

A turning point was the Western-backed ouster of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. With his demise, many Tuareg from the region who had fought as mercenaries for Gaddafi returned home, bringing with them the contents of Libya’s looted armouries.

Some of the returnees launched a rebellion in Mali to try to create a breakaway Tuareg state in the desert north, a movement that was soon hijacked by al Qaeda-linked jihadists who had been operating in Mali for years.

Until then, Islamists in Mali had been recruiting and raising funds through kidnapping. In 2012, they swept across northern Mali, seizing key towns and prompting a French intervention that pushed them back in 2013.

Amid the violence and chaos, some of the Tuareg turned their guns on their rivals from other ethnic groups like the Fulani, who then went to the Islamists for arms and training.

In November 2013, a young Nigerien Fulani had a row with a Tuareg chief over money. The old man thrashed him and chased him away, recalls Boubacar Diallo, head of an association for Fulani livestock breeders along the Mali border, who now lives in Niamey.

The youth came back armed with an AK-47, killed the chief and wounded his wife, then fled. The victim happened to be the uncle of a powerful Malian warlord.

Over the next week, heavily armed Tuareg slaughtered 46 Fulani in revenge attacks along the Mali-Niger border.

The incident was bloodiest attack on record in the area, said Diallo, who has documented dozens of attacks by Tuareg raiders that have killed hundreds of people and led to thousands of cows and hundreds of camels being stolen.

“That was a point when the Fulani in that area realised they needed more weapons to defend themselves,” said Diallo, who has represented them in talks aimed at easing communal tensions.

The crimes were almost never investigated by police, admits a Niamey-based law enforcement official with knowledge of them.

“The Tuareg were armed and were pillaging the Fulani’s cattle,” Niger Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum told Reuters. “The Fulani felt obliged to arm themselves.”

“SELF-DEFENCE”

Gandou Zakaria, a researcher of mixed Tuareg-Fulani heritage in the faculty of law at Niamey University, has spent years studying why youths turned to jihad.

“Religious belief was at the bottom of their list of concerns,” he told Reuters. Instead, local grievances were the main driving force.

Whereas Tuareg in Mali and Niger have dreamed of and sometimes fought for an independent state, Fulani have generally been more pre-occupied by concerns over the security of their community and the herds they depend on.

“For the Fulani, it was a sense of injustice, of exclusion, of discrimination, and a need for self-defence,” Zakaria said.

One militant who proved particularly good at tapping into this dissatisfaction was Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, an Arabic-speaking north African, several law enforcement sources said.

Al-Sahrawi recruited dozens of Fulani into the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA), which was loosely allied to al Qaeda in the region and controlled Gao and the area to the Niger border in 2012.

After French forces in 2013 scattered Islamists from the Malian towns they controlled, al-Sahrawi was briefly allied with Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an al Qaeda veteran.

Today, al-Sahrawi is the face of Islamic State in the region.

“There was something in his discourse that spoke to the youth, that appealed to their sense of injustice,” a Niger government official said of al-Sahrawi.

Two diplomatic sources said there are signs al-Sahrawi has received financial backing from IS central in Iraq and Syria.

How Chefou ended up being one of a handful of al-Sahrawi’s lieutenants is unclear. The government source said he was brought to him by a senior officer, also Fulani, known as Petit Chapori.

Like many Fulani youth toughened by life on the Sahel, Chefou was often in and out of jail for possession of weapons or involvement in localised violence that ended in deals struck between communities, the government official said.

Yet Diallo, who met Chefou several times, said he was “very calm, very gentle. I was surprised when he became a militia leader”.

U.S. and Nigerien sources differ on the nature of the fatal mission of Oct 4. Nigeriens say it was to go after Chefou; U.S. officials say it was reconnaissance mission.

One vehicle lost by the U.S. forces was supplied by the CIA and kitted with surveillance equipment, U.S. media reported. A surveillance drone monitored the battle with a live feed.

Every major decision by the unlikely politician was determined by factors beyond his control. He entered politics after the 2005 assassination of his father and his resignation served the agenda of Riyadh.

The dependence of their leaders on powerful external patrons is nothing new in Lebanon, where regional powers from Saudi Arabia to Iran have long tussled for geopolitical advantage.

But the case of Hariri, who many Lebanese think was summoned to the Saudi capital, coerced into resigning and put under house arrest - which he has denied - underscores an instance of external pressure extreme even by Lebanon’s high standards.

In an interview on Sunday, he said he will return to Lebanon in the coming days and might reconsider his resignation. Even if he does, the events of the past 10 days show how decisions taken beyond Lebanon's borders would still define his role.

His shock resignation statement on Nov. 4, which has thrust Lebanon into a new political crisis, included a laundry list of Saudi complaints about the behavior of Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, Riyadh’s main political adversaries.

Iran and Hezbollah, Hariri said, are “sowing strife” in the Arab world.

As Riyadh’s ally at a time of its enemies’ ascendancy, Hariri was already playing Lebanon’s intricate political game from a position of weakness.

A year ago, after spending years abroad, he agreed to join a national unity government with President Michel Aoun, a former rival and Hezbollah ally, that included Hezbollah itself.

It was a compromise he said was necessary to end Lebanon’s sectarian-tinged political paralysis and one that was personally difficult, as Hariri accuses Hezbollah of the assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri.

He seemed committed to that compromise until the moment he flew to Riyadh on Nov. 3, telling officials of discussions planned for his return the following Monday.

Saudi Arabia had previously accepted Hariri’s political bargain in Lebanon. But Iran’s trumpeting of its successes along with Hezbollah in the wars in Syria and Yemen at the expense of Saudi allies may have altered Riyadh’s calculation.

A day after traveling to Riyadh, Hariri appeared on television reading a statement of resignation.

IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER

Hariri’s career was built on the backing of Gulf states, the deployment of his family fortune - spending large amounts of it in Lebanon to finance a media network and charitable gifts to secure widespread support - and feelings of respect among many Lebanese for his late father.

In his resignation address, Saad said: “We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of Rafik al-Hariri”.

In Lebanon’s sectarian system, the prime minister must always be a Sunni Muslim and Rafik made his family pre-eminent among Lebanese Sunnis.

Rafik carved out a business empire in Saudi Arabia with the backing of its ruling family and returned to Lebanon to rebuild when the civil war there ended in 1990, serving twice as prime minister. The car bomb that killed Rafik gave Saad little choice but to adopt a previously unsought role as political leader.

Before being plunged into Lebanon’s volatile politics, Saad had led a playboy lifestyle running his father’s business. He was raised in Saudi Arabia and has Saudi nationality.

Outrage at Rafik’s killing helped Hariri’s movement to electoral victory five months later and he installed a political ally as prime minister, not taking the post himself until 2009.

It was the first government headed by factions opposed to the influence of Syria - and by extension Damascus’ allies Iran and Hezbollah - since the 1975-90 Lebanese civil war.

That opposition came to a head in 2008 when the government tried to seize Hezbollah’s telecommunications network, triggering street battles in Beirut that the heavily armed Shi‘ite Muslim movement won.

Qatar brokered a compromise, with Hariri becoming head of a coalition government that included Hezbollah. But Hezbollah pulled out in 2011, bringing down the administration.

DIMINISHED SWAY

As tensions rose over the war in neighboring Syria, Hariri left Lebanon, spending most of the ensuing years abroad until he returned months before joining a new government last year.

But his sway - and that of his family’s regional patron Saudi Arabia - had diminished. The formation of last year’s government was widely seen in Lebanon as an acknowledgement of the political dominance of Iran and Hezbollah.

Saudi Arabia’s own apparent impatience with Hariri became evident in the fortunes of the family company - Saudi Oger - whose billions had underpinned their political role in Lebanon.

With a new dispensation in Riyadh under King Salman and his ambitious son Prince Mohammed, and a fall in oil prices damaging its finances, the Saudi government seemed less willing to roll out big state projects to enrich some allies.

When Hariri’s first stint as premier ended in 2011, he said in a newspaper interview: “In Lebanon it’s never over for anyone”.

A source in his camp said a compromise to bring him back to Beirut as prime minister was still possible if Aoun distanced himself from Hezbollah’s regional role.

Such a statement by Aoun might give some satisfaction to Saudi Arabia, but it would seem to leave Hariri no stronger than before.

After so public a departure, especially one delivered from abroad, his dependence on Riyadh has been made especially visible. His enemies in Lebanon even mocked his Arabic during his resignation speech as being more Saudi than Lebanese.

And the posters of him that have appeared across Beirut with the slogan “We are with you” looked less like statements of mass support than solidarity with a political hostage.",Lebanon's Hariri shackled by bigger outside forces,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-politics-hariri/lebanons-hariri-shackled-by-bigger-outside-forces-idUSKBN1DD24P

O Ibovespa fechou em alta 0,43 por cento, a 72.475 pontos. O giro financeiro do pregão somou 8,05 bilhões de reais.

O ministro das Cidades, Bruno Araújo, pediu demissão nesta segunda-feira, na primeira baixa tucana do governo do presidente Michel Temer. Segundo analistas, a medida pode facilitar a acomodação da reforma ministerial e, consequentemente, agilizar o trâmite para a reforma da Previdência.

Antes, o índice passou o dia trocando de sinal dentro de uma margem limitada, com investidores evitando assumir posições mais firmes diante de um noticiário mais esvaziado. O Ibovespa oscilou entre queda de 0,54 por cento e alta de 0,79 por cento.

“Algumas articulações até começam a dar a impressão que o governo talvez consiga o número mínimo de votos (para aprovar a reforma da Previdência). Mas é muito incerto ainda e a bolsa fica meio de lado”, disse o gerente de renda variável da H.Commcor Ari Santos.

De forma geral, o mercado segue com uma visão mais otimista para o mercado acionário no longo prazo, mesmo diante da fraqueza recente que tirou o Ibovespa das máximas históricas em meados do mês passado.

A Coinvalores calcula que o índice pode chegar a 91 mil pontos em 12 meses, levando em consideração o preço-alvo das ações de empresas que compõem o índice.

The maker of Budweiser and Bud Light said on Monday that Joao Castro Neves would be succeeded on Jan. 1 by another Brazilian company veteran, Michel Doukeris, currently chief sales officer of the global business.

“Neves had been viewed as a potential successor to Brito. If Doukeris can deliver on growth in the U.S., this would boost his chances for the top spot,” Jefferies analysts said.

Other contenders identified by the analysts are David Almeida, chief integration officer, and Ricardo Tadeu, president of African operations.

Brito said it was too early to speculate on CEO succession.

“It’s up to the board to make that decision. But for me, I’ve been here 20-plus years and I’ll be here another 20.”

Brito said he had discussed the departure of Neves with him for nearly a year and that it was a “personal decision”.

Doukeris, a 44-year-old Brazilian citizen with Greek heritage, last year moved his family to New York, the de facto headquarters of what is one of Europe’s biggest companies with a market value of about $200 billion.

The biggest challenge in the coming years will be to lift sales in the United States, where Bud Light is the largest brand with 19 percent of the market but has been in steady decline alongside mainstream lager rivals as U.S. consumers increasingly embrace wine and spirits.

BEER SHIFT

When they do drink beer, they are choosing more unusual craft beers made by smaller producers or imported beers, particularly from Mexico.

AB InBev has sold less beer in North America each year since 2014, with a steep 6.2 percent drop in the third quarter of this year.

“People are trading up,” said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg. “I don’t think anyone is really hoping for dramatic volume turnarounds. Just stopping the bleeding is the hope.”

Sales volume for the U.S. beer industry was down 1.8 percent for the first nine months of the year and has been down for the past decade, according to Wells Fargo analysts. Per capita beer consumption is down 20 percent in the past 35 years.

Doukeris, who joined the company in 1996, has run its Chinese and Asia Pacific operations, helping to expand Budweiser globally, and launched its “High End” business strategy focused on growing imported and craft beers. AB InBev has acquired nearly a dozen craft beers in recent years.

Brito, who has run the company for 12 years, said the United States is the company’s most important market and that Doukeris is the ideal person to lead it.

The CEO cited Doukeris’s sales background, which differs from the likes of former U.S. chiefs Luiz Edmond, who excelled at cost-cutting, and Neves, who strengthened relationships with wholesalers.

“He’s very consumer-centric, he has a great commercial mind,” Brito told Reuters, adding that the company will focus more on category expansion and category management, approaches learned from SABMiller, which AB InBev bought a year ago for $100 billion.

SALES AND MARKETING FOCUS

Under Doukeris, analysts said they expected an approach that would prioritise pulling in consumers rather than pushing distribution.

Doukeris said “the real opportunities” are in how to better organise the portfolio for growth, adding that he would supplement a national strategy with identification of pockets within the U.S. where he could boost sales of Budweiser and Bud Light.

Separately on Monday the company announced five other North American appointments, including the promotion of Brendan Whitworth, a veteran of PepsiCo and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, to vice president of sales.

AB InBev shares closed little changed at 100.50 euros in Brusssels.

The company’s high-end strategy was launched in China and expanded to 22 countries while Doukeris ran the sales division, garnering the business more than $5 billion in global sales. But in September the unit announced a reorganization that included the loss of roughly 2 percent of its workforce, about 300 jobs.

Craft beer is off its double-digit growth rates but is still expected to grow at about 6 percent this year, compared with an overall beer sector that could be down as much as 1.5 percent, Susquehanna analysts said.
