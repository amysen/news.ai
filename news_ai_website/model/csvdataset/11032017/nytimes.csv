True, Northam did better than Clinton had, but only modestly so, as The Times’s Nate Cohn noted. That’s another way of saying that Trump’s success with the white working class now looks almost like the norm.

Patrick Ruffini, a savvy conservative pollster, made a similar point when analyzing Virginia’s House of Delegates results. On first glance, those results look fantastic for Democrats. They flipped 15 of the 100 delegate districts, including a few inspiring long-shot wins. Yet only a single one of those 15 districts had voted for Trump. Republicans largely held the Trump districts, which let them keep control (pending recounts), 51 delegates to 49.

I know that many progressives are tired of hearing about the white working class. They would rather stop obsessing over small-town America and instead pursue a coalition of minorities and highly educated whites, like the coalition that won Virginia last week.

But giving up on the white working class would be a terrible mistake. Whites without four-year college degrees make up fully half of the adult population, and they tend to be dispersed, rather than packed in small geographic areas, which increases their political power.

Accepting landslide defeats among the white working class effectively forfeits many state legislatures — like those in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, all of which are now Republican. State legislatures don’t just make policy. They are also in charge of gerrymandering.

Without the white working class, Democrats will need everything else to go spectacularly well to retake the House of Representatives next year. Virginia itself has four Republican-held seats that analysts think will be in play. Northam won only two of those four districts, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

Or consider the Democrats’ four special-election House losses earlier this year, including the high-profile Georgia race. All were in Trump-won districts that Democrats couldn’t quite flip.

How can the party can do better? It’s not an easy problem, and I wouldn’t trust anyone who claims otherwise. But the crux of the matter is clear enough: Democrats have to get the white working class to focus on the working-class part of their identity rather than the white part.

Most voters don’t make decisions by doing a cost-benefit analysis of candidates’ proposals. They instead tend to vote for candidates who instinctively seem to get their lives. Voters are attracted to candidates with whom they can identify.

Trumpism focuses people on the white part of identity. The Virginia campaign, for example, revolved around talk of immigrants and old Confederate heroes. When those are the topics, Democrats are going to struggle (however frustrating that may be).

But race isn’t the only part of people’s identities. When voters instead focus on class, Democrats thrive. Think back to Barack Obama’s populist-tinged 2012 re-election campaign. Or look at the senators, like Sherrod Brown and Claire McCaskill, who hold their own outside of metropolitan areas. Or the landslide victories for ballot initiatives on Medicaid and the minimum wage.

The best news for Democrats is that they don’t turn off many suburban and urban voters by focusing on class. Most of them are struggling with slow-growing wages, too.

Again, no one should pretend that finding the perfect message is easy. And no one should pretend that the Democrats have already found it.","Democrats, Don’t Be Fooled by Victory",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

For Asian-American chefs, this is the conundrum, and the opportunity.","So these chefs’ cooking, born of shame, rebellion and reconciliation, is not some wistful ode to an imperfectly remembered or never-known, idealized country. It’s a mixture of nostalgia and resilience. It wasn’t taught — certainly not in the way other cuisines have been traditionally taught. Graduates of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., recalled that little time was devoted to Asian cooking; at Le Cordon Bleu in London and in Paris, none. One instructor took offense when Preeti Mistry, whose Indian-inflected restaurants include Juhu Beach Club in Oakland, Calif., likened a French stew to curry. Another told David Chang that pork stock, essential to tonkotsu ramen, was “disgusting.”

Neither does their cooking have much kinship with the “fusion” cuisine of the early 1990s, when non-Asian chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Gray Kunz began folding Eastern ingredients into otherwise Western dishes. (“Fusion” is another term that sits uneasily with Asian-American chefs. “I wouldn’t call myself ‘fusion,’ ” said Maiko Kyogoku, the owner of the idiosyncratic Bessou in New York. “To describe food that way? It’s an extension of myself.”) In spirit, Asian-American cooking is closer to other American-born cuisines with tangled roots: the Lowcountry cooking of coastal South Carolina, which owes a debt to slaves from West Africa who brought over one-pot stews and ingredients like okra, peanuts and black-eyed peas; and Tex-Mex, which is not a bastardization of Mexican food but a regional variant of it, cultivated by Tejanos, descendants of Hispanics who lived in Texas when it was part of Mexico and, before that, New Spain.

There’s also no one cultural touchstone or trauma that binds Asian immigrants: no event on a national scale that has brought us together. But part of what distinguishes our experience from that of other immigrants and people of color is the fraught, intimate relationship between our countries of origin and the U.S., which has been foe and protector, oppressor and liberator, feared and adored. In 1899, the British writer Rudyard Kipling urged the U.S. to “take up the White Man’s burden” in the Philippines after the Spanish-American War:

Go send your sons to exile

To serve your captives’ need

[...] Your new-caught, sullen peoples,

Half devil and half child.

This begot more than a century of American military intervention in East and Southeast Asia, and a history of conflicting images: Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima; the Vietcong in black pajamas and the American atrocities at My Lai; teeming refugee camps and smiling American G.I.s handing out candy, decade after decade, to throngs of dark-haired, starving children.

Any immigrant is an outsider at first. But for Asians in America, there is a starker sense of otherness. We don’t fit in to the American binary of white and black. We have been the enemy; the subjugated; the “lesser” peoples whose scramble for a foothold in society was historically seen as a menace to the American order. And yet we’ve also been the “good” immigrants, proving ourselves worthy of American beneficence — polite, humble, grateful, willing to work 20-hour days running a grocery store or a laundry or a restaurant that will never be “authentic” enough, to spend every dime on our children’s test prep so that they get into the best schools, because we believe in the promise of America, that if you work hard, you can become anyone. If you try hard enough, you might even be mistaken for white.

Among the children of immigrants, Asians in America seem most caught in a state of limbo: no longer beholden to their parents’ countries of origin but still grasping for a role in the American narrative. There is a unique foreignness that persists, despite the presence of Asians on American soil for more than two centuries; none of us, no matter how bald our American accent, has gone through life without being asked, “Where are you from? I mean, originally?” But while this can lead to alienation, it can also have a liberating effect. When you are raised in two cultures at once — when people see in you two heritages at odds, unresolved, in abeyance — you learn to shift at will between them. You may never feel like you quite belong in either, but neither are you fully constrained. The acute awareness of borders (culinary as well as cultural) that both enclose and exclude, allows, paradoxically, a claim to borderlessness, taking freely from both sides to forge something new. For Asian-American chefs, this seesaw between the obligations of inheritance and the thrill of go-it-aloneness, between respecting your ancestors and lighting out for the hills, manifests in dishes that arguably could come only from minds fluent in two ways of life.

Thus the kaiseki at Niki Nakayama’s n/naka, in Los Angeles, always includes a pasta course. Her slyly voluptuous “carbonara” of abalone livers and egg yolks is a homage to Tokyo-style wafu spaghetti with briny pickled cod roe — only here it’s capped with shaved truffles. At Tao Yuan, in Brunswick, Me., Cara Stadler takes tiles of goat cheese made by a local creamery and sears them, as is done in Yunnan, to approximate rubing, a sturdy farmer’s cheese. But instead of merely sprinkling the cheese with sugar or salt, she counters its meatiness with a bright grace note of mint and watermelon from summer’s height. A Caesar salad might be supplanted by a canoe of romaine, grilled for a hint of smoke and loaded with dainty jako (dried baby sardines) and quail eggs as anchors, as at Bessou in New York. Or, as re-envisioned by Chris Kajioka at Senia, in Honolulu, it might be a mossy cliff of charred cabbage — a wink at an iceberg wedge — dusted with shio kombu (shredded kelp boiled in soy and mirin), soaked through with dashi and ginger, and surrounded by daubs of heady green goddess dressing and buttermilk turned to gel. It’s not so much a salad as a cheeky biography of it by the barbarian at the gates, achieving the quintessence of an American classic through Asian ingredients.

And while Asian-American cooking may not be expressed in or identified by a single set of flavors, one thing that does unite such disparate traditions is an emphasis on textures. Indeed, if the cuisine can be said to have revolutionized American food, it’s by introducing unfamiliar mouth feels — crackle where one doesn’t expect it, slime in a country that’s always shied away from that sensation — into our culinary vocabulary. Justin Yu, who recently opened Theodore Rex in Houston, rhapsodizes about “the crunch that you can hear in the back of your head”; unrendered, gelatinous animal skin, “a fun burst of fat and softness”; broths barely skimmed, or with a spoonful of fat added “to coat the lips.” The maverick Katsuya Fukushima, of Daikaya in Washington, D.C., once turned natto — a gooey, slippery skein of fermented soybeans, with the perfume of castoff socks — into an earthy caramel over soft-serve. Like Latin-American food, which made Americans crave heat, Asian-American cuisine has made “difficult” textures not only desirable but as integral to food as flavor itself. That certain ingredients still make some Western diners squeamish is part of its provocative fun.

But the question remains: Does calling this kind of cooking Asian-American cuisine deepen and contextualize our understanding of it, or is it just a label, like speaking of Asian-American art or fiction — a way of simplifying a complex story and making it a marketable cliché? The danger is fetishizing Asian features, a tendency that diminishes: If you are an exotic object or phenomenon, you may never become recognized or acknowledged as more. “White chefs are using these ingredients and saying, ‘Oh, it’s so strange,’ ” Tin Vuong, of Little Sister in Los Angeles, said. “It isn’t.” Instead of a historical matrix of Asian culinary traditions, “young cooks just see a big pantry,” Fukushima said. “Take a little bit of this, a little bit of that — there’s no soul to it.”

Chang believes that food “has the potential to sort of show that we’re all the same.” But even he isn’t entirely comfortable with the ubiquity of kimchi. “Let’s say you spent no time in Asia, you just found a recipe on YouTube,” he said. “That’s appropriation. It’s not about skin color. You have to have a story, pay respect to what it was and what it means.” At the same time, it seems reductive to expect Asian-American chefs to make food that somehow reflects their personal “story.” On season three of “Top Chef,” Hung Huynh, a Vietnamese-American contestant, was faulted for cooking that was technically dazzling but lacked explicit reference to his roots. “You were born in Vietnam,” Tom Colicchio, the head judge, said. “I don’t see any of that in your food.” (It’s hard not to hear an echo of the trope of the inscrutable Oriental, whose motives can’t be deciphered, and the common criticism of Asian-Americans at school and at work as being overly cerebral and lacking feeling.) The strictures of reality TV do demand a baring of the soul, but not all Asian-American chefs want to work with Asian flavors — and when they do, it’s not always in expected ways.

Must every Italian chef make lasagna, every French chef coq au vin? Anita Lo, who closed her fine-dining restaurant Annisa in New York earlier this year, cooked there for 17 years without fealty to one region or cultural tradition. This puzzled some diners. “I had someone come in and say, ‘Where’s the big Buddha head?’ ” she said. When publications request recipes and she submits one without Asian ingredients, the response is often, “We were really hoping for something Asian” — or Asian-ish: Anything with soy, apparently, will do. “I send in Japanese, which isn’t even my background, but that works,” she said.

Corey Lee’s “Benu” cookbook is filled with stories: of his grandmother foraging for acorns; of his mother forcing him to drink a tonic of brewed deer’s antlers; of his father bringing home live lobster for his son’s birthday, and of the joys of eating tomalley (the wet gray-green paste that acts as a lobster’s liver and pancreas) on buttered bread. All suggest that Lee’s dishes, however rarefied, are also deeply autobiographical. But Lee demurs, the way a novelist might, fending off a critic’s attempt to find in his books correlations to actual events, wanting them to stand alone as fully imagined works of art. “There’s great pressure for chefs to have a story,” he said. “Maybe there’s no story beyond, ‘I want to serve this food and it tastes good.’ ”

It’s the eternal plea of the minority, to ask to be judged not by one’s appearance or the rituals of one’s forbears but for the quality of one’s mind and powers of invention. Certainly our country was predicated on the right to shed one’s past and be reborn, to come from nothing and work your way up; in this, Asians may be among the most American of Americans. But why is the choice always between exotic caricature or rootlessness? The philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues that the embrace of “ethnic” restaurants is merely “tolerance” of a “folklorist Other deprived of its substance”: “The ‘real Other’ is by definition ‘patriarchal,’ ‘violent,’ never the Other of ethereal wisdom and charming customs.” Too often Asian-American chefs are presumed to double as educators or ambassadors, representing an entire race, culture or cuisine.

In the end, doesn’t it matter — not to others, but to ourselves — where we are from? And no, I don’t mean “originally.” I mean the forces that made us: the immigrants who raised us, with all their burdens and expectations, their exhortations to fit in but never forget who we are; and the country we grew up in, that is our only home, that taught us we are “other” but also seems, in some confused, tentative way, to want to learn something from us.

For Asian-American chefs, this is the conundrum, and the opportunity. The foods of their childhoods were once mocked and rejected by their non-Asian peers (and by their ashamed or rebellious younger selves); then accepted in dilute, placating form; and now are able to command audiences who clamor for their sensations and aggressive flavors, and who might be unnerved if they knew exactly what they were putting in their mouths. What may be most radical about Asian-American cuisine is the attitude that informs and powers it, reflecting a new cockiness in a population that has historically kept quiet and encouraged to lay low. It’s food that celebrates crunchy cartilage and gelatinous ooze, that openly stinks, that declares: This is what I like to eat. What about you? Do you dare?","Asian-American Cuisine’s Rise, and Triumph",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/t-magazine/asian-american-cuisine.html

Instead of draining the swamp, he has set the fox to guard the henhouse.”

Democratic senators also reacted skeptically to Mr. Azar’s nomination, promising to scrutinize his record for evidence that he would be soft on drug companies.

La Niña is back, but not with a vengeance.

The National Weather Service on Thursday announced the return of La Niña, which occurs when the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean is several degrees below normal for an extended period. The oceanic conditions are the opposite of El Niño.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This year’s version of La Niña was called “weak” by the Weather Service, which estimates it will continue until between February and April. Generally, La Niña means that the southern United States will see temperatures rise and precipitation levels fall. (And vice versa in the northern half of the country, where temperatures generally fall while precipitation levels rise.)

This winter, there is a 30 to 50 percent chance that Central and Southern California will see above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But projections are not guarantees. California had it second-wettest season on record last winter, defying forecasts for dry conditions.

College and university endowment earnings are usually tax-exempt. But as endowments have sought greater investment returns in recent years, they have shifted more of their money out of traditional holdings like United States equities to alternative, potentially more lucrative investments. These include private equity and hedge funds that frequently borrow money, opening them up to tax consequences.

When schools earn income from enterprises unrelated to their core educational missions, they can be required to pay a tax that was intended to prevent nonprofits from competing unfairly with for-profit businesses.

Establishing another corporate layer between private equity funds and endowments effectively blocks any taxable income from flowing to the endowments, the reason they are called blocker corporations. The tax is instead owed by the corporations, which are established in no-tax or low-tax jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.

“Congress is essentially subsidizing nonprofits by allowing them to engage in these transactions,” said Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University who co-authored a paper on blocker corporations in 2015. “They’re allowing them to borrow so that they can build up their endowments.”

The use of blocker corporations has raised concerns among policymakers in recent years. That’s partly because they cost the United States Treasury millions of dollars, but also because they legitimize an opaque offshore network sometimes used for nefarious purposes.

“They’re not cheating. They’re not hiding money or disguising money,” said Samuel Brunson, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago who has studied endowment taxation. “But they’re adding money to a system that allows people, if they want to hide their money, to do it.” Not only do the universities benefit — so does the wealthy and influential private equity industry.

Perhaps illustrating the sensitivity of the topic, officials at most of the college and university endowments that use blocker corporations, including Colgate, Dartmouth, Duke and Stanford, declined to comment specifically, citing longstanding policies against discussing their investments. Among them was Matt Kavgian, the director of strategic communications for Indiana University’s $2 billion endowment, which had invested $10 million with Quintana.

An exception was the Quintana shareholder Texas Christian University, whose chief investment officer, Jim Hille, acknowledged that the $1.5 billion endowment had used blocker corporations. Mr. Hille said the decision to use one often came down to whether the expected return would offset the cost of establishing a blocker corporation.

References to such corporations in the Appleby files, shared with The New York Times by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained them from the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, date back at least to 2003. At that time, five elite schools — Columbia University, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University — became partners in a Bermuda-based group called H&F Investors Blocker.

H&F Investors Blocker was formed to invest with one of the largest private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman, in shares of Axel Springer, a German publisher of newspapers and magazines.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Minutes from meetings at Appleby’s office in Hamilton, Bermuda, never mention tax avoidance or even explain why the word “blocker” is used in the partnership’s title. But an audit by Ernst & Young, contained in the minutes, shows that H&F Investors Blocker would owe no federal income tax.

By 2008, the University of Texas system — whose endowment last year was $24.2 billion, behind Harvard’s ($34.5 billion) and Yale’s ($25.4 billion) — asked Appleby to set up a Cayman Islands company called TX Liquidity Capital so “certain tax advantages will accrue to the system,” documents show.

Fred Cole, a guitarist and singer who became a cult hero of the Pacific Northwest music scene as the leader of the long-running garage-rock band Dead Moon, died on Thursday at his home in Clackamas, Ore. He was 69.

The cause was cancer, said his wife and bandmate, Toody Cole.

As the grunge gold rush in the 1990s made stars of young bands in and around Seattle like Nirvana and Soundgarden, Mr. Cole and Dead Moon remained beloved local stars despite being decades older than their peers.

Well into his 40s by then, Mr. Cole had been a regular of the garage-rock circuit — playing a rough and raw sound that long predated grunge’s noisy take on punk — since the mid-1960s, when he was a member of the Lollipop Shoppe, which had a minor hit in 1968 with “You Must Be a Witch.”

But with Dead Moon and various other groups over the years, Mr. Cole set a standard for do-it-yourself perseverance. He and his wife released records on their own label, Tombstone, with a dark, handmade aesthetic. He even cut lacquer discs, used to make vinyl records, on an old mono lathe at their home outside Portland; according to legend, it was the same machine used to make the Kingsmen’s “Louie Louie” in 1963.

Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they “have little or no nutritional value.”

Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — approved a 10 percent tax.

Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.

Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexico’s tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers.

Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout. In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.

The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax “has been consuming vast amounts of resources,” and that “our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.”

In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.

Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobón, in the spotlight. Postobón, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country’s biggest media company, RCN Televisión, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postobón and RCN declined interview requests.

The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.

Showdown Over an Ad

In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country’s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country’s main rebel group, the FARC.

In March 2016, the country’s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages — the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle — that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia’s president and the Ministry of Finance.

“For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,” said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. “Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children’s lunchboxes.”

The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia’s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.",She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry.

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.

Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.

There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck’s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.

At one point the computer’s “vision” briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn’t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.

“Sometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I’m used to the truck driving,” Mr. Runions said.

Starsky’s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions’s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky’s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.

Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.

“One driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,” Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.

The March of Automation

Starsky’s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea — having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments — is something of an industry consensus.

“One of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,” said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber’s self-driving truck unit.

As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark’s autonomous trucks.

From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux’s California warehouses.

“It’s a mirror of what we would do if there weren’t a driver inside,” said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.

A few miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.

Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton’s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.

Josh Switkes, the company’s chief executive, said that because Peloton’s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.

“Our basic approach is let’s bring real value to the fleet and society now,” Mr. Switkes said.",Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/self-driving-trucks.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Weekend Update Riffs of the Week

The topic of sexual misconduct resurfaced in a pair of riffs by the “Weekend Update” co-anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che.

Mr. Jost began by saying, “Well, it’s a good weekend to stay inside, since it’s 20 degrees out, and everyone you’ve ever heard of is a sex monster.” (At this moment, the screen showed pictures of Louis C.K., Mr. Spacey, Harvey Weinstein and Mr. Moore.)

Mr. Jost continued:

Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of having inappropriate sexual relations when he was in his 30s with several teenage girls. Now, I’m not saying he’s guilty, but his naughty little cowboy outfit is screaming it. He looks like a guy who shows up in “Westworld” and says, Hey can someone show me where the middle school is? And how are we still surprised that someone who puts the Ten Commandments up everywhere doesn’t follow them? What’s next, it turns out the guy who always jokes about masturbating wasn’t joking about masturbating?

(Here the screen showed another picture of Louis C.K.)

In his own run of jokes, Mr. Che said, “Alabama state auditor Jim Zeigler defended Roy Moore using Mary and Joseph as examples, saying, ‘Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.’ Oh, word? So that’s what you’re going with? Roy Moore was trying to make a Jesus? Oh, O.K. So I guess R. Kelly was just trying to make it rain for 40 days and 40 nights.”

Human Resources Staff Member of the Week

In a desk-side character piece on “Weekend Update,” Cecily Strong played Claire, an especially harried member of NBC’s human resources department, as she attempted to educate Mr. Jost on the company’s sexual harassment policy.

Administering a quiz to Mr. Jost, Ms. Strong asked, “What is the appropriate way to handle a workplace relationship: A) inform someone at H.R.; B) lock her in a room and make her look at it; or C) bully her out of the entire industry?”

When Mr. Jost correctly answered A, Ms. Strong replied, “You’d be surprised how many people get that wrong. It could make you lose your damn mind,” then cackled for good measure.

She also held up a doll dressed in a suit and asked Mr. Jost, “When talking to a co-worker in the office, where should you keep your penis?” (“Just point on the doll where your penis should be,” she explained. “No wrong answers here, just super wrong answers.”)

Ms. Strong told Mr. Jost he had passed but warned, “I’m sure I’ll be back next week and the week after that, forever and ever,” she said. “Because all of this isn’t just a scandal. It didn’t just start last week. It’s just actual reality for half of the population.” She then took a swig of hand sanitizer, glanced at her phone and exclaimed, “George Takei, no!”

Equal Opportunity Offenders of the Week

A sketch in the guise of an advertisement for the Democratic National Committee featured several “S.N.L.” cast members and a couple of beloved alumni playing prominent Democrats celebrating the party’s electoral successes this week. The tone was set by Alex Moffat, playing Senator Charles Schumer of New York, who declared, “We haven’t felt this confident since the day before Trump won.”

The sketch also featured Ms. Strong as Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Ms. McKinnon as Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader. “Together, we’re going to end the spirit of divisiveness in this country by focusing on how we won the governor’s races in two of the 10 states we care about,” Ms. Strong said.

Ms. McKinnon said, “And we learned our lesson from the last election: We can’t just appeal to coastal elites. We need mouth-breathers from Wisconsin.” Ms. Strong added, “And window-lickers from Ohio as well.”

Larry David, who hosted “Saturday Night Live” last weekend, reprised his recurring role as Senator Bernie Sanders while making reference to his own controversial “S.N.L.” monologue. “We’re really going to lace into people if they don’t say what’s politically correct,” Mr. David said. “Like these comics out there who think it’s O.K. to make jokes about concentration camps. That guy should rot in hell.”

Factors That Don’t Correlate

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Comparisons in Other Societies

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises.
Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated.
Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves.
This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr.","We know that love is dangerous, because it requires facing one’s own brokenness and vulnerability. Yet both of our nations are morally broken, imperfect. So we speak with the impassioned words of Mahatma Gandhi: “I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.”

This letter fervently asks more from you and from the United States. The writer James Baldwin, one of our most prophetic voices, wrote: “One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself — that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.” Neither of our nations has much to give the other because each has failed to risk itself. And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises. It serves as an intervention as we face the potential horrors of unspeakable mass death. We stand with our brother Martin Luther King Jr., who refused “to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.”

There are many here in the United States who will say that this letter is absurd, useless, even treasonous. Well, if love is treasonous, then we take joy in it. We revel in speaking out against hatred; inhumanity; divisiveness; discourse mired in immature name-calling; ugly, disparaging remarks; talk of destruction and obliteration; and the potential of miscalculation and nuclear conflagration. We prefer to stand on the “treasonous” side of Jesus, who dared to love.

We are traitors to those who reject mutual respect and who believe that there is no place for love as a binding force greater than mutual bullying and provocation. We are traitors to our country’s divisive rhetoric, filled with militarism, hatred, blood lust and warmongering, just as we stand opposed to yours, which threatens not only us, but also your neighbors — that is, your own brothers and sisters, and even your own people. As men of color, we know the semblance of that threat from within our own country.

To hate requires so little; to love requires doing what may feel impossible, because it means to lay down the sword and stretch out your hands, your arms, your hearts, to each other. Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated. Those people fail to imagine with their hearts. Dr. King said: “We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” And Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, another prophetic American voice of love, asked us, “How many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt.”

That kind of love refuses to hate, it refuses to believe that we are “enemies” by birth. We are brothers and sisters born of a common humanity. We believe in a love that remembers the humanity that binds us together, that opens us to hear the other’s voice, the other’s mourning. Then again, perhaps Baldwin was correct, “There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.” Yet we believe that reciprocal love can take us to that place together and heal our wounds.

David Kyuman Kim: These feel like especially loveless times. We write from the conviction that the values of a love-driven politics can transform how we engage each other not only as nations but also as human beings. Which is to say, a love-driven politics insists that we seek compassion, generosity, kindness, forgiveness and mercy for each other as much as we do for ourselves.

Our president was elected to represent our people, but he has not represented the best of us. He has instead chosen to display only our basest traits. While he is not the first president to speak and act with hubris and arrogance, he has chosen belligerence over diplomacy, bullying over accord, insult over care. He represents a strand and strain of the American experiment that stubbornly holds on to the misguided notion that we are a nation of destiny and superiority, strengthened on legacies of white supremacy and rapacious capitalism. He has exacted those misguided ideals by treating you with disrespect and disregard, all the while belittling you as a leader of your own people, and you, in turn have done the same.

As a Korean-American, I have to acknowledge you both as one of my people and very much not of my people. My mother’s family is from North Korea, and so in some very real ways, you and I are of common stock. But a land does not make for family. If anything, you and your father have shown how land and nation can destroy families and traumatize them for generations. You are the leader of a nation whose people have suffered at the service of a political vision. At what cost has your loyalty to power come to your people, let alone to your humanity?

My mother’s family fled North Korea because of the forces of war that are all too similar to the enmities that are threatening us today. And it was the consequences of the Korean War and the havoc it wreaked on my people in South Korea that eventually drove my family to the United States. And through this migration and growing up in white-supremacist America, I was transformed from our common stock to a Korean-American dedicated to the ways of love.

Indeed, as a Korean brother I have been forged by my inheritance from Christianity and Confucianism. This means that my witness to you is born of traditions of love and ethical responsibility. Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves. This is especially challenging at a moment in which love has been hard to find and discern. For those of us who lament the ascendancy of our current president, we have had to learn how to love ourselves once again.

We write you today not only because of what you are hearing from us — the United States — but, more important, because of all the crucial things you are not hearing. As defenders of civil rights against racism, we come from a tradition not well represented or well understood, yet one that has transformed the course of our nation’s history and the lives and legacies of peoples across the globe.

This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr. This is a tradition that insists that love has the power to bind us together in a common purpose, that love gives us the confidence and courage to stand up to injustice and suffering. It is a tradition that holds us accountable not simply to ourselves but to a vision of human existence that insists that we can be with one another, hold one another up, and fortify one another’s humanity in what Dr. King called “the beloved community.”

We reach out to you from this tradition that holds the value of speaking truth to power with love. This is a calling. It is our vocation. We have no choice but to strive to live up to the examples of Dr. King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, of activists like Fannie Lou Hamer and Grace Lee Boggs. These heroic figures have been exceptions to the insidious rule of an American legacy of white supremacy and imperialism that has left the least among us in utter despair. This tradition of radical love is an American tradition, even though it has drawn deeply and powerfully from people like Gandhi and Thich Nhat Hanh.

We come to you as citizens of an America not yet fully realized, one that insists that the ways of love can be the ways of democracy, that the challenge of loving one’s neighbors and enemies is fundamentally a call for freedom and justice and hope. We write to you with love and an appeal for forgiveness and mercy because history and our lot demand this of us. And our hope is that it will demand the same of our fellow citizens.

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

Early this year, a major public hospital in Rome listed two job openings for gynecologists, specifying that it was seeking candidates who were not conscientious objectors. The Italian Bishops’ Conference denounced the ad as discriminatory, but a local court said it was legal. In August, an administrative court in Rome ruled that medical personnel could not invoke conscientious objection to refuse prescribing birth-control pills or withhold certificates of pregnancy, which women seeking an abortion need. Local media called the decision a “revolution.”

Almost as soon as Law 194 was passed in 1978, the Church and its political proxy then, the Christian Democratic Party, tried to have it repealed. A referendum was held in 1981, but voters rejected the idea — roundly, by a margin of 2 to 1. Having failed to change the law, the Church then set out to exploit its internal contradictions — which it had helped create.

Even as Law 194 guarantees the right to an abortion, it “recognizes the social value of motherhood.” According to Angela Balzano, a researcher in philosophy and bioethics at the University of Bologna, that built-in tension, along with “the loophole provided by the clause on conscientious objection,” was an attempt to mediate between “two irreconcilable positions” in the late 1970s: the abortion-rights agenda of the Radical Party, a leading left-wing party, and the anti-abortion Catholics. She called this “a clear case of judicial antinomy.”

Four decades later, it’s apparent who has benefited from that weakness, and this result is no accident. Pope Francis himself, speaking at a gathering of Italian Catholic physicians in 2014, encouraged doctors to make “brave choices that go against the current,” referring pointedly to conscientious objection and abortion.

Although the Christian Democrats are no longer, Catholicism remains a major political force. The religious movement Comunione e Liberazione (Communion and Liberation), whose stated mission is to promote the “education to the Christian faith” and comes under the pope’s direct authority, has thousands of supporters — some say many thousands — including in hospitals, universities and women’s clinics, and among politicians in center-right parties, like those who opposed Mr. Borraccino’s law in Apulia.

In addition to legalizing abortion, Law 194 called for establishing specialized women’s clinics. But after years of cuts to the state health care system, many clinics today are Catholic, and those refuse to provide even information or basic services to women seeking an abortion. What’s more, they are partly funded with taxpayer money: 0.8 percent of personal taxes are directly allocated to the Church, unless taxpayers specifically ask to opt out. So much for the separation of Church and state.

The law granting women access to abortion has been gutted, Assunta Sarlo, a journalist and activist with the feminist group Usciamo dal Silenzio (Let’s End the Silence), told me, partly “because the religious forces have been able to count on political allies in what remains a strongly Catholic country.” But it’s also, she said, “because the reputation of abortion is such that choosing to be a gynecologist who carries out this type of procedure is akin to career suicide.”

Opinion polls suggest that the vast majority of Italians still support access to abortion. But some three-quarters of the population also call themselves Catholic, and so even for some Italians who support women’s right to terminate a pregnancy, abortion still carries a stigma. And that’s just the kind of tension that the Church has been expert at exploiting — at a great cost to women, as well as the rule of law, in Italy.","Abortion in Italy, a Right Wronged",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/abortion-italy-conscientious-objectors.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Perhaps most significantly, half of the Obama-Other voters are committed to voting for the Democrat in 2018; half are undecided (presumably between voting and not voting at all). Based on my analysis of Voter Study Group data, these voters tend to be much more nonwhite, poorer and less educated than the overall electorate. They’re the marginal voters Democrats need to mobilize to win.

The next graphic measures voters’ attitudes toward economic and cultural issues.

The Fault Line: Culture Wars The three groups of vote switchers are largely left-of-center on economic policy (Obama-Clinton voters are included for comparison). But the Obama-then-Trump segment is much more conservative on social issues — suggesting they won’t be easily won over to the Democratic side. Bars indicate the range of political views held by about 95 percent of the people in each voter group. Centrist How they voted in: Liberal Conservative ’12 ’16 Economic issues Obama Clinton 3rd party/ didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Cultural issues Obama Clinton 3rd party/ didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Bars indicate the range of political views held by about 95 percent of the people in each voter group. Centrist More liberal More conservative How they voted in: 2012 2016 Economic issues Obama Clinton Third party or didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Cultural issues Obama Clinton Third party or didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton

The Obama-Trump voters who plan to stick with Republicans are more consistently conservative on both economic and cultural dimensions, but particularly on the latter (they are still broadly left of center on the economic dimension).

The Republican-voting Romney-Clinton voters don’t differ too much from Democrat-voting Romney-Clinton voters — this group might include those who have always voted Republican; maybe some old liberal Nelson Rockefeller-style Republicans; or maybe some voters who don’t follow politics very closely and don’t realize that the Republican Party is more conservative than them. In the Obama-Other category, the undecideds look a lot like the Democratic voting decideds, squarely in the liberal camp.

Since most of the voters are in all three subgroups (and the national electorate, too) lean left economically, a strong progressive economic message would almost certainly help Democrats. Moving right on economics, by contrast, will not help Democrats with any of these voters and could even risk losing some, demoralizing an energized base, especially younger voters.

On culture, there’s also not a whole lot to be gained by triangulating, particularly if Democrats want to mobilize the Obama-Other category of voters. Besides, if the racially tinged campaign of Mr. Northam’s opponent, Ed Gillespie, is indeed a preview of how Republicans plan to run in 2018, Democrats are going to have a hard time neutralizing cultural issues, and they’re going to struggle to win over rural voters who are motivated by these issues.

Their best bet will be to offer a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters.

The Virginia results suggest Democrats still might also be able to expand their base without attempting to reach these voters with a new economic populism — results that will certainly give comfort to the donor class of the party that gets nervous every time Bernie Sanders begins talking. The inevitable pendulum swing against the Republican Party, Mr. Trump’s deep unpopularity, an energized electorate and the wave of Republican congressional retirements — and the slow but steady demographic shift toward a younger, more diverse electorate — will all give Democrats an advantage that they can ride mostly just by being Democrats and not doing stupid things.

Project this trend forward, and perhaps a just-out-of-reach suburban Atlanta House district that a Democratic nominee, Jon Ossoff, narrowly lost this year becomes a narrow Democratic pickup in 2018.

Still, the better bet for Democrats would be to present a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters.

Nor is Maria Borrallo, the full-time nanny to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

But something about Instagram’s ostensible greater intimacy, perhaps, makes the exclusion more jarring. Ivanka Trump leaves her nanny out of frequent Instagrams of her three children; it’s been noted that she mentions the word “nanny” but once in her book, “Women Who Work.”

One may think parents just want to take credit for all the child care, but there are also potential security concerns. “They don’t want to promote that this might be a nanny for a child of means,” said Seth Norman Greenberg, marketing director at Pavilion Agency, a high-end domestic staffing company based in New York.

A nanny’s immigration or income status can also be a deterrent. In the last nine years, Oliver Quillia, a producer and father of two in the Bronx, has posted exactly one photo on Instagram of his beloved nanny, Lynn, whose last name he withheld for similar reasons. “If it weren’t for the ‘under the table’ pay we give her, I would probably post way more photos of her,” Mr. Quillia, 47, said.

But when oversharing parents omit nannies on Instagram or Facebook, it can indeed be intended to shape perception of their own characters. “I think many of us on social media, probably subconsciously, want to perpetuate this idea that we’re doing it all on our own,” said Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School and a mother of two.

Ms. Petrzela is a self-described “exhibitionist” on Facebook, but it wasn’t until five years after she and her husband hired their nanny, Nancy Peter, that she realized she’d never posted a photo of the woman they consider a “third parent.” (Ms. Petrzela’s husband hadn’t, either, but he’s not active on social media).

“My children respect and love her so much, and I do too,” Ms. Petrzela, 39, recalled thinking. “Why am I making that invisible?”

Ms. Petrzela, who is white, had also considered the racial context between her and Ms. Peter, who is Afro-Caribbean. Though Ms. Petrzela is confident their relationship is respectful, “the history of white families being ministered to by women of color is not a really beautiful history,” Ms. Petrzela said. “Part of me felt hyper-aware about even the impression that any of those dynamics are repeating themselves in our home.”

While Ms. Peter is not on Facebook, she said she appreciates being included. “It makes me feel part of the family,” she said. “I did not give birth to the kids, but I love them very much.” Of other parents who don’t want pictures with their nannies, she said, “It’s not fair. I’m going to tell you the truth: most parents feel that if the children are too close to the nanny, that they’re losing something.”

Lauren Stein, a media executive and mother of two boys in New York, says she praises her live-in nanny (whose name she’d rather not share) “in real life” but worries that posting odes to her on Facebook would only make Ms. Stein look fancier-than-thou and fuel mockery from her relatives.

“A lot of them crack jokes, like, “Oh, Lauren, you’re here without your help? Is that hard for you? Are you surviving?’” Ms. Stein, 35, said.

That class discomfort goes both ways, according to Grace Savage, a former nanny in Los Angeles. “I think that a deeply institutionalized notion of ‘place’ is to blame,” Ms. Savage, 35, said. “The domestic doesn’t feel welcome in the photo, and the employer feels no inclination to extend such welcome.”

According to Ms. Gold, lifting the veil of secrecy and posting more about nannies on Instagram and Facebook would be a new way to value them, while also getting real with other parents about what it takes for working moms and dads to juggle it all.

“It’s great to say, ‘I have help,’” Ms. Gold said.

Andrea Lavinthal, the style and beauty director at People magazine, is a rare parent who does so on social media. Last week, she posted an Instagram Story of her 1-year-old son, Saxon, perched on the lap of his nanny, Ann Marie, who did not want her last name published.

“She’s such a part of the fabric of this squad,” Ms. Lavinthal, 38, said. “I wouldn’t even think about cropping her out.”",Where Are All the Nannies on Instagram?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/style/where-are-all-the-nannies-on-instagram.html

Besides Mr. Flannery and the company’s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, executives from only two G. E. units — jet engines and electrical-power generators — made presentations.

Emphasizing his belief in the vitality of a smaller G. E. — and nodding to products like electric generators, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment — Mr. Flannery accompanied his presentation with slides that said the company would continue to “power the world,” “transport people safely” and “save lives.”

Yet his address also mentioned other businesses he described as “fundamentally strong,” including wind turbines for renewable energy, and the company’s railroad-equipment unit, which is expected to be sold off over the next few years.

G. E. had nearly 300,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year. The impending sales of several businesses and other cost-cutting initiatives will undoubtedly leave it a smaller company.

Yet Mr. Flannery portrayed the path ahead not as one of retreat but as one an opportunity, for G. E. workers and for the company’s investors.

“We will produce results that our owners, and that we, will be proud of.” he said. “This is our time to reinvent the company.”

Since becoming chief executive, Mr. Flannery has moved swiftly to roll back spending. He grounded the corporate jet fleet, stretched out the construction schedule for G. E.’s new headquarters in Boston, closed down several international research-and-development labs and trimmed the work force in units like GE Digital, the company’s ambitious effort to become an industrial-software powerhouse.

Mr. Flannery had previously announced an acceleration of cost-cutting goals established under his predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, who targeted $1 billion annually this year and next. Mr. Flannery doubled the 2018 goal to $2 billion in expenses to be eliminated.

G. E.’s stock price, which had fallen by 35 percent as of Friday, was down more than 5 percent in midday trading on Monday after the announcement that the dividend would be cut.

G. E. last cut its dividend in 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis, when it was the nation’s largest non-bank financial institution. That dividend cut was the first since the Great Depression for a company long revered as a model of enlightened management.

The move announced on Monday reflects the company’s declining cash flow, but it also underscores Mr. Flannery’s decision to further pare back G. E.’s portfolio of businesses. The total dividend payout had been more than $8 billion a year, among the most costly for American corporations. But the cash flow to cover that bill has faltered.

When G. E. reported its third-quarter earnings last month, it said that cash flow for the year would be about $7 billion, down from an initial target of $12 billion to $14 billion.

G. E. executives emphasized that this year’s cash shortfall was attributable to two businesses — the oil-field equipment unit, which showed persistent weakness, and its power-turbine business, which had a surprisingly sharp decline. Both units are expected to improve their performance next year, executives said, lifting G.E.’s cash flow in the process.

Still, Mr. Flannery and his team on Monday cautioned that 2018 would be “a reset and stabilization year.”

And given the slimming-down strategy, G. E. will be a shrunken company, with fewer businesses to contribute cash in the future.",G.E. Cuts Dividend as New C.E.O. Moves to Streamline an Industrial Giant,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/ge-dividend-flannery.html

Nearly all of those watching were hobbyists, logging countless hours outside their day jobs.

“When I put it all together and started mapping it out, I saw how big the scale of it was,” said Jonathan Albright, who met Ms. DiResta through Twitter. Mr. Albright published a widely read report that mapped, for the first time, connections between conservative sites putting out fake news. He did the research as a “second job” outside his position as research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.

Senate and House staff members, who knew of Ms. DiResta’s expertise through her public reports and her previous work advising the Obama administration on disinformation campaigns, had contacted her and others to help them prepare for the hearings.

Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement that researchers like Ms. DiResta had shown real insight into the platforms, “in many cases, despite efforts by some of the platforms to undermine their research.” Mr. Warner is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

One crucial line of the questioning — on how much influence Russian-bought advertisements and content had on users — was the result of work by Ms. DiResta and others with a Facebook-owned tool. “Facebook has the tools to monitor how far this content is spreading,” Ms. DiResta said. “The numbers they were originally providing were trying to minimize it.”

Indeed, at the congressional hearings, the tech companies admitted that the problem was far larger than they had originally said. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said it was a “crazy idea” that misinformation on Facebook influenced the election. But the company acknowledged to Congress that more than 150 million users of its main site and a subsidiary, Instagram, potentially saw inflammatory political ads bought by a Kremlin-linked company, the Internet Research Agency.

Ms. DiResta contended that that is still just the tip of the iceberg. Minimizing the scope of the problem was “a naïve form of damage control,” she said. “This isn’t about punishing Facebook or Twitter. This is us saying, this is important and we can do better.”

In response, Facebook said it had begun organizing academic discussions on disinformation.

“We regularly engage with dozens of sociologists, political scientists, data scientists and communications scholars, and we both read and incorporate their findings into our work,” said Jay Nancarrow, a Facebook spokesman. “We value the work of researchers, and we are going to continue to work with them closely.”

A graduate of Stony Brook University in New York, Ms. DiResta wrote her college thesis on propaganda in the 2004 Russian elections. She then spent seven years on Wall Street as a trader, watching the slow introduction of automation into the market. She recalled the initial fear of overreliance on algorithms, as there were “bad actors who could come in and manipulate the system into making bad trades.”

“I look at that now and I see a lot of parallels to today, especially for the need for nuance in technological transformations,” Ms. DiResta said. “Just like technology is never leaving Wall Street, social media companies are not leaving our society.”

Ms. DiResta moved to San Francisco in 2011 for a job with the O’Reilly Alpha Tech Venture Capital firm. But it wasn’t until the birth of her first child a few years later, that Ms. DiResta started to examine the dark side of social media.

“When my son was born, I began looking into vaccines. I found myself wondering about the clustering effects where the anti-vaccine movement was concentrated,” Ms. DiResta recalled. “I was thinking, ‘What on earth is going on here? Why is this movement gaining so much momentum here?’”

She started tracking posts made by anti-vaccine accounts on Facebook and mapping the data. What she discovered, she said, was that Facebook’s platform was tailor-made for a small group of vocal people to amplify their voices, especially if their views veered toward the conspiratorial.

“It was this great case study in peer-to-peer misinformation,” Ms. DiResta said. Through one account she created to monitor anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, she quickly realized she was being pushed toward other anti-vaccine accounts, creating an echo chamber in which it appeared that viewpoints like “vaccines cause autism” were the majority.

Soon, her Facebook account began promoting content to her on a range of other conspiratorial ideas, ranging from people who claim the earth is flat to those who believe that “chem trails,” or trails left in the sky by planes, were spraying chemical agents on an unsuspecting public.

“So by Facebook suggesting all these accounts, they were essentially creating this vortex in which conspiratorial ideas can just breed and multiply,” Ms. DiResta said.

Her published findings on the anti-vaccine movement brought her to the attention of the Obama administration, which reached out to her in 2015, when officials were examining radical Islamist groups’ use of online disinformation campaigns.

She recalled a meeting with tech companies at the White House in February 2016 where executives, policy leaders and administration officials were told that American-made social media platforms were key to the dissemination of propaganda by ISIS.

It was during that time that she first met Jonathan Morgan, a fellow social media disinformation researcher who had published papers on how the Islamic State spreads its propaganda online.

In “The Exterminating Angel,” based on the 1962 Luis Buñuel film, Ms. Luna plays Leticia, an opera diva who is part of a blue-bloods dinner party, the guests of which find themselves mysteriously unable to leave at the end of the evening. The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G.

Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder.","The deal was done at a crossroads.

There, according to legend, the bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for otherworldly musical prowess — guitar playing, singing and songwriting that would make him an idol, still studied and revered almost 80 years after his death.

Zeke Schein came to a crossroads, too, when he bought an old photo (Slide 1) that he believes is only the third known image of Johnson. Johnson’s family, a prominent forensic expert and musicians who’ve been transformed by the bluesman’s recordings agreed with Mr. Schein. But skeptics questioned the likeness, the date — even Mr. Schein’s motives.

Intent on defending himself and the image, Mr. Schein began a journey to learn more about the sharp-dressed men in the sepia print. He chronicles his search in “Portrait of a Phantom: The Story of Robert Johnson’s Lost Photograph,” a book he co-wrote with Poppy Z. Brite, recently published by Pelican.

He talked about the book at another crossroads, Matt Umanov Guitars, a Greenwich Village landmark where he has worked since 1989. He wrote that the store is such a magnet that “if you sit at the front counter of Matt Umanov Guitars, the world comes to you.” Since we began this conversation Matt decided to close the store after 53 years. Zeke put on his walking shoes, and moved on to Rudy’s, his next crossroads.

Mr. Schein discovered the photo while searching for old guitars on eBay. The 3-inch-by-4-inch print from sheet film wasn’t in great shape – “The photo looked haunted, like it had been to hell and back,” he wrote. But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005. Mr. Schein was familiar with vintage and vernacular photography. He makes photographs as well as plays music, with a deep appreciation of the tools of each form, since before selling guitars, he’d sold cameras and worked in a lab. He immediately thought the image was a contact print from sheet film, likely done with a Speed Graphic, because of the sharpness.

“Looking at the paper,” Mr. Schein said, “I could tell it was that cheaper, crumbly paper that you would see in old photo albums, photos of maybe my grandparents and even early photos of my father would be on that type of paper.” He dated it to the 1930s. Johnson died in 1938.

Photo

“And then if you look at the print, if you see it online, you’ll see that the edges are black,” Mr. Schein said. “It’s not masked. So you’re not seeing white edging on there — you’re seeing what looks like a negative which was laid down flat.” (A negative’s clear edge comes out black on a contact-sheet print.)

Mr. Schein also guessed that the man in the lighter suit in the photo was Johnny Shines, another blues legend who died in 1992. Mr. Schein later learned of a documentary about Johnson, “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” in which Shines said that there was a photo of him and Johnson taken in 1937 by a photographer named Johnnie Mae Crowder in Hughes, Ark., and that it ran in a local newspaper. If the two were posing for a newspaper photographer, she might very well have used a Speed Graphic, which was standard equipment then.

After showing the photo to friends and musicians who, like Mr. Schein, knew intimately the details of the two authenticated photos of Johnson, many agreed that he’d discovered a third image. Trouble was, when he showed the photo to two old Delta bluesmen, David “Honeyboy” Edwards and Robert Lockwood Jr., who’d both known Johnson, neither of them recognized the man holding the guitar.

Skeptics questioned whether the photo was from the 1930s, since it looked as if the man on the right wore a zoot suit, a 1940s fashion fad featuring wide lapels and shoulders and high-waisted baggy pants. But the style was based on the “drape suit” worn by African-Americans a decade earlier; in the 1933 film “International House,” Cab Calloway’s band wore similar suits.

Some also have suggested that the photo was reversed, since the man in the light suit wore his watch on his right wrist and the man in the dark suit has a pocket square on the right side of his jacket, rather than the left. If the photo is flipped, this meant Johnson is holding the guitar as a left-handed player, not a righty. But since the guitar is stringless, it could have been a studio prop, so it wouldn’t matter how Johnson held it.

More people joined the search. Frank DiGiacomo, who wrote about Mr. Schein’s photo for Vanity Fair in 2008, showed a copy to Claud Johnson, Robert’s son, who agreed that it was his father.

A lawyer for the Johnson estate sent a copy of the photo to Lois Gibson, a forensic specialist who had identified the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square at the end of World War II. She said that the man holding the guitar in Mr. Schein’s photo appeared to be Johnson.

The Vanity Fair piece seemed only to spur attacks on the photo and criticism of Mr. Schein, with some accusing him of pushing it for financial gain, even though he’d assigned the copyright to the Johnson estate.

“We do all share a love of that music and we all play it, including writers and historians who decided to attack what I was doing and also question the integrity — my integrity — in what I was doing and that of the Johnson family,” Mr. Schein said. “They were accusing us of only being in it for money, which was never the goal for either of us. I needed to at least explain my position, why I cared so much about trying to put out a musician’s image who affected me.”

Despite years of investigations, more needs to be done. Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder. “I stumbled on this one,“ he said. “I don’t have the skill set to go further than I did.”

But maybe you do.

“In a wild-hopes situation — wildest hopes — I hope someone reads my story and has the knowledge and experience to take my research and what I’ve been able to do a step further.”

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

But this nightmare year has upended assumptions about the durability of the rules, formal and informal, governing our politics. There’s a metaphysical whiplash in how quickly alarm turns into acceptance and then into forgetfulness. It was astonishing when Trump installed Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, a man who had previously run a white nationalist tabloid; now it feels like ages ago that he was even in the White House.

No one lives here for the weather, however. Mr. Rankine, the mayor, said a sunny day “has been known to happen occasionally.”

Fortunately, he added, “Skipton is one of those places which is absolutely beautiful in the rain — as long as you are dressed appropriately.”

Simon Myers, a retired lawyer who serves on Craven District Council, recalled standing outside his home on a day when it was raining so hard that the hill opposite was invisible, then turning to his neighbor and saying, “Do remind me it’s the views that we live here for.”

Craven is an affluent pocket of the north, though not the richest place in the country. To Mr. Myers, that illustrates that wealth and happiness are not synonymous.

“I think it’s about being self-sufficient, valuing your communities, and doing your bit and mucking in together,” he said. “It isn’t because we can afford fancy cars.”

This being Yorkshire, not everyone is buying the notion of Craven as Shangri-La.

“It’s not as wonderful as those who make these claims for it say,” said Mr. Routledge, sipping a pint of local beer, which, incidentally, is roughly half the price of a pint in London.

“The traffic is appalling, there are not enough places to park and it’s too expensive,” he said. “The bus services have been cut back, and it’s a honey pot for commuters into Leeds and Bradford, so a lot of local people can’t afford to live here.”

Mr. Routledge, who lives a few miles away, has ruffled feathers by describing Skipton as “snooty” — a word its residents tend to reserve for a nearby upmarket town, Harrogate.

Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood.","With a leak of intelligence methods like the N.S.A. tools, Mr. Panetta said, “Every time it happens, you essentially have to start over.”

Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency’s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.

Mr. Snowden’s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.

Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.

American officials had to explain to close allies — and to business leaders in the United States — how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.

Inside the agency’s Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency’s arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs — including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.’s leaked tools.

“It’s a disaster on multiple levels,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.”

In response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency “cannot comment on Shadow Brokers.” He denied that the episode had hurt morale. “N.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,” he said.

Compounding the pain for the N.S.A. is the attackers’ regular online public taunts, written in ersatz broken English. Their posts are a peculiar mash-up of immaturity and sophistication, laced with profane jokes but also savvy cultural and political references. They suggest that their author — if not an American — knows the United States well.

“Is NSA chasing shadowses?” the Shadow Brokers asked in a post on Oct. 16, mocking the agency’s inability to understand the leaks and announcing a price cut for subscriptions to its “monthly dump service” of stolen N.S.A. tools. It was a typically wide-ranging screed, touching on George Orwell’s “1984”; the end of the federal government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30; Russia’s creation of bogus accounts on Facebook and Twitter; and the phenomenon of American intelligence officers going to work for contractors who pay higher salaries.

One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers’ identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. “Russian security peoples,” it said, “is becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.”

Russia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.

Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?

Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.

“We have had a train wreck coming,” said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. “We should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.”

America’s Cyber Special Forces

At the heart of the N.S.A. crisis is Tailored Access Operations, the group where Mr. Williams worked, which was absorbed last year into the agency’s new Directorate of Operations.

Photo

T.A.O. — the outdated name is still used informally — began years ago as a side project at the agency’s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington’s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.

The hacking unit attracts many of the agency’s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources — say, a Chinese official’s home computer or a Russian oil company’s network. Much of T.A.O.’s work is labeled E.C.I., for “exceptionally controlled information,” material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.’s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.

The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work “challenging and sometimes exciting.”

T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. “The nature of the business is to move with the technology,” a former T.A.O. hacker said.

Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants — computer code designed to find material of interest — left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.

The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.’s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.

It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.

Like cops studying a burglar’s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 — a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.’s collection, including three so-called ops disks — T.A.O.’s term for tool kits — containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.

Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.

But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.

Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies — hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.’s defenses — because, as one put it, “I know we’ve done it to other countries.”

The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.

He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.

“That feels like a betrayal,” he said. “I was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.”

The Hunt for an Insider

For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. — No Such Agency, in the old joke — was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.

The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library’s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.

The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have Russian hackers lift them from his home computer; and Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.

Mr. Martin’s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.

But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.’s Vault7 breaches.

Then there are the Shadow Brokers’ writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: “Don’t Forget Your Base.” With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the “deep state”; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.

“TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,” the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. “TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.”

The mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique — nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble — the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.

Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.

Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A’s mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including “graybeards” they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.

“Snowden killed morale,” another T.A.O. analyst said. “But at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they’re liars.”

Because the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds. Trust has eroded as anyone who had access to the leaked code is regarded as the potential culprit.

Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.

“How much longer are the releases going to come?” a former T.A.O. employee asked. “The agency doesn’t know how to stop it — or even what ‘it’ is.”

One N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.

But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers’s agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies’ findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral’s time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.

A Shadow War With Russia?

Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials’ strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.

But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.

Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia’s state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.

In the meantime, Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.

Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky’s efforts to find and retrieve the N.S.A.’s secrets wherever they could be found. The T.A.O. hackers knew that when Kaspersky updated its popular antivirus software to find and block the N.S.A. malware, it could thwart spying operations around the world.

So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.

In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group — the company’s name for T.A.O. hackers — and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.

As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.

On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers’ name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.

“We hack Equation Group,” the Shadow Brokers wrote. “We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.”

Inside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency’s hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.

The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.

Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said — because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a “dead man’s switch” to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.

Mr. McConnell made his most recent comments to reporters on Monday at a news conference about the Republican tax plan. He said party leaders were considering a write-in option. Watch the video here.

On Thursday, Mr. McConnell had made a more qualified statement, saying that Mr. Moore should step aside before the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations were true.

Susan Collins of Maine made a similar shift on Monday, dropping her initial “if true” caveat and calling on Mr. Moore to withdraw from the race.

Todd Young of Indiana made the same demand on Monday in his first statement on the allegations, saying that if Mr. Moore did not step aside, “we need to act to protect the integrity of the Senate.”

“After giving Roy Moore ample time to unequivocally deny the disturbing allegations against him, those allegations remain far more persuasive than the denials,” Mr. Young said. “Roy Moore should immediately drop out of the race. The appearance of grossly reprehensible behavior disqualifies him from service in the United States Senate.”

Four other Republican senators — John McCain of Arizona, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Steve Daines of Montana and Mike Lee of Utah — unequivocally renounced Mr. Moore last week.

Mr. McCain was the first, tweeting on Thursday that Mr. Moore should step aside.

Mr. Lee tweeted on Friday, “Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate.” Mr. Daines and Mr. Cassidy quickly followed.

A fifth senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, wrote that Mr. Moore should never have been nominated to begin with.

And Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said in an interview with KCCI-TV on Friday that Mr. Moore “should step aside,” but added: “The trouble is, if he agreed to step aside, his name is still on the ballot. People can still vote for him, and he could get elected.”

‘If true …’

By far the most common reaction has been a call for Mr. Moore to step aside if the allegations were true. That was the first response of more than 30 senators, though none explained what criteria they would use to judge the truth of the accusations.

If the allegations are true, “I don’t think this candidacy is sustainable,” John Cornyn of Texas said, “but we believe in a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and so I think it’s important for the facts to come out.” Texas’ other senator, Ted Cruz, called the reports “serious and troubling” but added, “Judge Moore has the right to respond.”

Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, Michael B. Enzi, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, Orrin G. Hatch, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, James M. Inhofe, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Jerry Moran, Lisa Murkowski, David Perdue, Jim Risch, Pat Roberts, Mike Rounds, Marco Rubio, Richard C. Shelby, Dan Sullivan, John Thune and Thom Tillis also made “if true” statements.

Others, though they included the caveat, seemed more inclined to jettison Mr. Moore. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Mr. Moore should step aside “if there is any shred of truth to the allegations,” and Ben Sasse of Nebraska spoke similarly.

Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Tim Scott of South Carolina said they found the accusations more believable than Mr. Moore’s denials; Rob Portman of Ohio said he assumed they were true because the women making them were on the record. On Monday, Roy Blunt of Missouri released a similar statement.

“The women have a more credible story than Judge Moore,” said Mr. Blunt, who had previously been silent on the allegations. “Alabama voters should have a better choice, and Judge Moore should have better answers to these charges.”

And Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Mr. Moore “should be dealt with very severely” if he behaved as reported.

“Any person who believes these allegations are not that bad,” Mr. Graham told ABC’s affiliate in Columbia, S.C., “I don’t want them to be a part of the Republican Party.”

‘Start thinking about who they’ll write in’

It is too late to replace Mr. Moore on the ballot, but Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Sasse, Mr. Toomey and now Mr. McConnell have floated the idea of a write-in campaign — perhaps by Luther Strange, who holds the seat Mr. Moore is seeking but lost the Republican primary. (Last week Mr. Strange called the report “very, very disturbing” and said he would later have “something to say” about whether he would re-enter the race.)

“If there’s an ounce of truth to any of this, Roy Moore has no place in public life and ought to drop out immediately,” Mr. Sasse said. “Alabamians should start thinking about who they’ll write in.”

Ms. Murkowski, who won a write-in campaign herself after losing a primary in 2010, told Politico on Thursday that she had spoken with Mr. Strange, who told reporters he was researching his options.

But “a write-in is very difficult, let’s face it,” Mr. Toomey acknowledged. “There’s no easy solution to this.”

‘They’re very, very old charges’

Only one senator, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, explicitly declined to suggest that Mr. Moore step down, even with the “if true” caveat. Why, he asked, didn’t the women who spoke to The Post come forward earlier?

“They’re very, very old charges,” Mr. Wicker told Mississippi News Now. “You have to ask, and I think people in Alabama will be asking, why this hasn’t come out in the 40 years’ time with him running for so many offices.”

The fifth-floor sitting room with the piano is the place for making music.
Do the Olafssons ever ask themselves if it was crazy to do expensive renovations on an ever-expanding place they don’t own?
“When I was growing up, I knew some of these people through my father, who was a novelist,” Mr. Olafsson said.
“And then we were like, ‘What are we going to do on the fifth and the sixth floor?’” Mr. Olafsson recalled.","With the approval of the owner, who has become a good friend, the Olafssons broke through ceilings and built floating wood staircases to connect the units. Along the way, they added a laundry room and did away with one bathroom and three kitchens, moving their own kitchen one flight up to capture as much sunlight as possible.

Name: Olaf Olafsson Age 55 Occupation Media executive and novelist Housing Works “I like writing here. You know how it is: If something works with your writing, you don’t want to change it.”

“One of the problems with townhouses is that the kitchen is usually on the ground floor, and that’s always the darkest place in the building,” said Mr. Olafsson, who, like his wife, was born and raised in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Granted, there is duplication of space: Each floor has a sitting room. The third-floor sitting room is the spot for doing puzzles and, thanks to the recent acquisition of a turntable, for listening to music. The fourth-floor sitting room is for watching television. The fifth-floor sitting room with the piano is the place for making music. But the family tends to do most of its sitting in the kitchen, which is outfitted with one of Mr. Olafsson’s favorite possessions, a Viking stove. Of course.

Do the Olafssons ever ask themselves if it was crazy to do expensive renovations on an ever-expanding place they don’t own? Yes, they do. Often.

“I wouldn’t call this a perfect situation,” Mr. Olafsson acknowledged. “You probably wouldn’t design it this way if you were starting from scratch. And it may not have been the wisest financial move. But we don’t think about that much.”

He needn’t add that hope springs eternal. The owner has promised the Olafssons first dibs on the building should he ever decide to sell.

Midcentury modern is the dominant theme, as represented by the kitchen table, by the desk and the Eames chair in Mr. Olafsson’s study, and by a Scandinavian side table, a bright-red Saarinen womb chair and an Eames lounge chair. But this is design without dogmatism. Deeming the effect too stark and off-putting, the Olafssons got rid of two very nice white midcentury sofas in the third-floor sitting room, replacing them with a pair of simple loden-green ones from Crate and Barrel.

Books are everywhere. So is Icelandic art, which the couple avidly collects. Among the paintings are works by Kristjan Davidsson, Jon Engilberts, Georg Gudni and Hordur Agustsson. “When I was growing up, I knew some of these people through my father, who was a novelist,” Mr. Olafsson said. “It’s always fun, in addition to having art you really like, to know the artist. You can still sort of relate to them through their work, though many of them have passed away.”

Four years ago, the Olafssons almost bought a six-story townhouse on the Upper West Side. What a prize: 7,000 square feet for them to divide and arrange as they pleased. “We were thinking we could finally have everything exactly the way we wanted,” Mr. Olafsson said.

The contract was to be signed on a Monday. The preceding Friday, the couple’s architect gave them a floor plan of their future home along with, quite literally, a homework assignment: Figure out what rooms you want to put where.

“We sat down at the kitchen table, and we were so excited,” Mrs. Olafsson said. “We were like, ‘Oh, the kitchen will be here and the living room will be here.’ We would have the perfect little entryway for guests, the bedrooms up here, a little office for Olaf up there. And I was thinking, ‘Maybe I’ll get a nice laundry room and maybe an exercise room because I like to exercise.’”

Things were moving along nicely. “And then we were like, ‘What are we going to do on the fifth and the sixth floor?’” Mr. Olafsson recalled. “‘We’re going to be talking to each other through an intercom. We’re going to be searching for each other.’ And our two sons were old enough that they were going to be out of the house soon.”

The couple looked across the table at each other, then looked again at the floor plan and the paperwork: 7,000 square feet; two years of construction. What were they thinking? They decided to stay put.

“We’re creatures of habit, I guess, but we like it here,” Mr. Olafsson said. “It’s home.”",The Ever-Expanding Rental,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/realestate/olaf-olafsson-ever-expanding-rental.html

Besides Mr. Flannery and the company’s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, executives from only two G. E. units — jet engines and electrical-power generators — made presentations.

Emphasizing his belief in the vitality of a smaller G.

Yet his address also mentioned other businesses he described as “fundamentally strong,” including wind turbines for renewable energy, and the company’s railroad-equipment unit, which is expected to be sold off over the next few years.

G. E. had nearly 300,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year. The impending sales of several businesses and other cost-cutting initiatives will undoubtedly leave it a smaller company.

Yet Mr. Flannery portrayed the path ahead not as one of retreat but as one an opportunity, for G. E. workers and for the company’s investors.

“We will produce results that our owners, and that we, will be proud of.” he said. “This is our time to reinvent the company.”

Mr. Flannery had previously announced an acceleration of cost-cutting goals established under his predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, who targeted $1 billion annually this year and next. Mr. Flannery doubled the 2018 goal to $2 billion in expenses to be eliminated.

G. E.’s stock price, which had fallen by 35 percent as of Friday, was down more than 5 percent in midday trading on Monday after the announcement that the dividend would be cut.

G. E. last cut its dividend in 2009 in the throes of the financial crisis, when it was the nation’s largest non-bank financial institution. That dividend cut was the first since the Great Depression for a company long revered as a model of enlightened management.

The move announced on Monday reflects the company’s declining cash flow, but it also underscores Mr. Flannery’s decision to further pare back G. E.’s portfolio of businesses. The total dividend payout had been more than $8 billion a year, among the most costly for American corporations. But the cash flow to cover that bill has faltered.

When G. E. reported its third-quarter earnings last month, it said that cash flow for the year would be about $7 billion, down from an initial target of $12 billion to $14 billion.

G. E. executives emphasized that this year’s cash shortfall was attributable to two businesses — the oil-field equipment unit, which showed persistent weakness, and its power-turbine business, which had a surprisingly sharp decline. Both units are expected to improve their performance next year, executives said, lifting G.E.’s cash flow in the process.

Still, Mr. Flannery and his team on Monday cautioned that 2018 would be “a reset and stabilization year.”

And given the slimming-down strategy, G. E. will be a shrunken company, with fewer businesses to contribute cash in the future.",G.E. Cuts Dividend as New C.E.O. Moves to Streamline an Industrial Giant,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/ge-dividend-flannery.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

(If all cars had V2V, they could blaze through complex intersections without stopping at all, modifying their speeds and headings to slide into gaps.)
Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions.","In his 31-year career delivering frozen patties, ketchup packets, ice cream and such to McDonald’s, Baskin-Robbins and other restaurants across the country, Dave Mercer logged more than three million miles, many of them in rigs he termed “bad news”: boxy, twin-stick-shift trucks that belched smoke and had no heating, air conditioning or radio. But they were sleek compared with the 18-wheelers his father drove before he was born. His father used to say that going uphill he could walk faster than his load; sometimes he would stand out on the running board to cool off and steer one-handed through his open door. “You’re not going to stop technology,” Mercer told me, when I asked him why he had decided to finish his professional life by test-driving trucks full time for a four-year-old Silicon Valley start-up. We were standing on the side of I-280 in Mountain View, Calif.; Mercer, wearing a Hawaiian shirt and dark glasses, had just finished demonstrating a system that a company called Peloton Technology plans to introduce in commercial fleets next year. “I wanted to come over and be a part of this before I retired,” he said. “I can tell some of the younger drivers. ... ” In lieu of finishing his thought, he punched his co-pilot, a quiet computer engineer, in the shoulder. Hundreds of hours riding shotgun with Mercer — panoramic views of the horizon, cars flowing streamlike down below — had inspired him and several of the company’s other engineers to get a commercial driver’s license. “I want to be part of that, too,” Mercer said.

Someday cars will drive themselves and coordinate with one another and smart cities and roadways to eliminate traffic jams and accidents — including the fatal one that happens in the United States every 15 minutes — while reducing fuel consumption and effectively giving back to Americans an annual per-capita average of 335 hours in which, for better or worse, they can use their hands and eyeballs in other ways. When and in what shape this utopian future will arrive, though, remains a persistent mystery. What is certain is that those who play the largest roles in solving it will be in a position to dictate — as those who control infrastructure always have been — which people and places they will empower and which they will upend.

An intelligent automated future, however, depends on the maturation of two entirely separate sets of technologies. The first — and the one that has drawn most of the investment and media attention in the last five years — will allow vehicles to drive themselves without any input from their surroundings. The other set of technologies will connect vehicles to their surroundings and to one another, in order to optimize the functioning of the vehicular ecosystem as a whole. Ultimately, these two types of systems will have to complement each other, yet neither can be implemented all at once. In the meantime, the process of developing and deploying them often puts them at odds. Indeed, the two systems are, in a sense, philosophically opposed: libertarian self-reliance in a race with socialist collectivity to be the first to improve traffic flow.

In Silicon Valley and elsewhere, where numerous start-ups are competing with software giants like Google and Uber in the “self-driving” category, Peloton has left high-level automation out of its immediate business plan. Rather, it has staked its early success — and the money of investors like UPS, Volvo and Intel — on a cooperative technology known as “vehicle-to-vehicle communication,” or V2V, which makes use of a shortwave portion of the radio spectrum that the Federal Communications Commission set aside in 1999 primarily for traffic-safety messaging. A signal can zip through this bandwidth thousands of times faster than the second or two it might typically take a driver to react. This valuable swath of ether (worth billions to the telecommunications industry, which is currently lobbying the F.C.C. to “share” it) facilitates unlimited potential applications, not just for sending data among vehicles but also for syncing them with traffic lights and other features of the environment. Currently, vehicles using it — the vast majority belonging to research pilot projects — broadcast encrypted information 10 times per second to any receivers within 1,000 feet that can decode it. This means that, unlike vehicles that are automated but not connected, they can “see” beyond their actual field of view: an accident just over the crest of a hill, an oncoming car around the corner. “It will save lives, and everybody knows that,” says Harry Lightsey, the executive director for emerging-technologies policy at General Motors, maker of the 2017 Cadillac CTS, the first commercially available car in the United States to carry the technology. “A delay in rolling out V2V will cost lives, and that’s a tragedy.”

It has been nearly two decades since the F.C.C. allocated bandwidth to be used primarily by V2V. So why does talk about the future of transportation tend to be dominated by fully automated vehicles? One reason is that most people simply assume automation includes connectivity to others on the road. It is also hard to explain what V2V is: Like the internet, it describes a medium with many possible uses, not a stand-alone product. Nor is there a single definition in play, really; though V2V typically refers to systems that operate in the F.C.C.-dedicated bandwidth, it can technically mean any type of connection among vehicles, or between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) or “everything” (V2X). Like the telephone’s, too, its value is contingent upon its dissemination — early customers, with no one to “call,” must buy into an abstraction.

Peloton believes that trucking companies are the natural place to start: They can outfit entire fleets at once and reap significant benefits from small improvements. Moreover, most of the 279 billion annual miles trucks travel are on highways, which are far more predictable than city streets and therefore an easier environment in which to usher in new driving features. Thus, the trucking industry is poised to be among the first to adopt both V2V and automated technologies on a grand scale, possibly becoming the arena in which they will compete with each other most ferociously for initial relevance and public acceptance.

On the day I met Mercer, he and Jake Gregory, a veteran F.B.I. agent who drove trucks in college and directed safety operations for a small fleet after leaving the bureau, were demonstrating Peloton’s first V2V application, called “platooning,” in a pair of 18-wheelers. (“Peloton,” the French word for “platoon,” also designates the main pack of cyclists in a road race.) They eased out onto I-280 with Mercer in the lead. I rode with Gregory, whose cab had been retrofitted with theater-style seats where a bunk bed used to be. These were occupied by Steve Boyd, a Peloton founder, who oversees external affairs; Oliver Bayley, the head of user experience design; and Rod McLane, the company’s marketing manager.

The specialties of these — user experience and public relations — were reminders of the “social problem” (as Bayley put it) that nags at Peloton. Their product is ready, and they expect to outfit hundreds of commercial trucks with it in 2018. But legislators, the general public and, crucially, truck drivers still fear it, often confusing it with automation, which many see as a threat to drivers’ jobs. (Even companies about to put it in their fleets decline to be named.) This unease is reflected in the rejection of the terms “self-driving” and “autonomous” in recent recommendations from SAE International, which publishes industry standards. Boyd, a former assistant press secretary for the White House, explained: “ ‘Autonomous’ is: You get into the truck and say, ‘I want to go to the office,’ and the truck says, ‘I want to go to the beach.’ ”

Gregory flipped a switch on the dash, and a screen — mounted where a car’s rearview mirror usually is — blinked on. “Platooning not authorized in this area,” it said. The system, Gregory said, was calculating the weight of Mercer’s truck ahead: “It takes a few minutes for it to establish mass.” The software also used a cellular signal to check with a cloud-based server run by Peloton engineers to see if Gregory was in an appropriate location: a divided highway accessible by only on-off ramps, more easily negotiated than crossings.

The system chimed, and the message changed: “Ready to platoon.” Gregory pressed a button that allowed Mercer’s truck to take control of his throttle and braking systems over the V2V bandwidth. It began to reel Gregory’s truck in until they were exactly 66 feet apart. By maintaining that gap, it created a slipstream that reduced carbon emissions and saved fuel by an average of 7 percent: 10 percent for the follower and 5 percent for the leader. (A team led by researchers at Purdue University, with a grant from the United States Department of Energy, believes it can help Peloton increase the average to 20 percent, which the team estimates would be worth up to $20 billion a year to the trucking industry.)

While continuing to steer, Gregory removed both feet from the pedals and planted them on the floorboard. Mercer slowed at an exit ramp, and Gregory’s truck automatically did, too, beeping at him to resume control. When I first heard about platooning, I imagined it would feel more death-defying, but though the size of the gap had initially unsettled Mercer and Gregory, it attracted little notice on the highway; oblivious passenger-car drivers frequently cut in, dissolving the platoon. In practice, the exercise felt more like an elaborate cruise-control upgrade than the opening bell in a transportation revolution. Bayley agreed: “It’s disappointing!”

Critics of V2V, especially those who are solely invested in full automation, dismiss platooning as mere high-speed tailgating. The major added safety benefits, they point out, come from the fact that, in order to platoon, trucks must be equipped with advanced safety features. Peloton readily agrees that its application, whose requirements include air disc brakes and state-of-the-art collision-avoidance, is an incentive for fleets to upgrade. V2V proponents, on the other hand, hope to leverage renewed federal interest in their systems to expand projects that have been gestating for decades. The Department of Transportation, under the outgoing Obama administration, proposed requiring that all new passenger vehicles be equipped with V2V — at least symbolically moving toward the realization of those goals. Earlier this month, however, reports suggested that the Trump administration might be inclined to shelve the proposal. “It’s important to get our government leaders to commit to this,” says Larry Head, an engineering professor at the University of Arizona, who is collaborating on V2I applications with Peloton. “We can’t wait five years. We’re ready now.”

To connect in any way is to cede control and reconfigure vulnerability. The history of civilization is one of trading pure independence — living alone in a cave, say — for comfort of one kind or another: companionship, enhanced productivity, protection. On balance, it is hard to argue that this exchange has not worked out in our favor. But the benefits of communing also exact steep prices — war, climate change, economic inequality — that are suffered individually. Since the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869 transformed the American landscape and economy, public transportation and infrastructure have given physical shape to moral questions that arise when we are forced to choose between self-interest and the greater good. In 1967, the British philosopher Philippa Foot posed a thought experiment that became known as the “trolley problem.” A runaway trolley is headed for five people tied to its track. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley to another track, where it will kill a single person. Is it more ethical to pull the lever or not?

As a society, we routinely make comparable decisions: when we let football players give one another brain damage in the interests of public entertainment; when a surgeon refrains from killing one terminal patient and transplanting his organs into five patients whom they might save. The trolley problem heightens individual culpability by bestowing absolute decision-making power on one person and demanding that she select not between actions but consequences, which in real life are rarely inevitable. Arguably, in doing so, the dilemma tends to reveal our natural inclination to accept fate over premeditation in situations with no happy outcomes, even if planning might partly mitigate an otherwise inevitable tragedy.

In recent years, the trolley problem has frequently been adapted to discussions about entirely automated cars, which respond to contingencies with binary logic. Suppose a distracted mother pushes a stroller with her baby in it out in front of such a vehicle — should the car be programmed to hit them or swerve into a tree? Azim Shariff, the director of the Culture and Morality Lab at the University of California, Irvine, was an author of a 2016 report in Science that described a series of surveys he and colleagues conducted in which participants overwhelmingly approved of autonomous vehicles, as the study terms them, that would “sacrifice their passengers for the greater good” and “would like others to buy them.” Unsurprisingly, however, they expressed a preference to ride themselves in autonomous vehicles that protect their passengers “at all costs.”

Engineers tend to scoff at the trolley exercise. (“I think the vehicle’s going to stop,” Larry Head told me.) But Shariff says this response takes the problem too literally. “That particular scenario may never come up, but the fundamental ethical trade-off that it’s revealing, apportioning risks among people on the road, is going to happen all the time,” he said. “It already does.” Inching closer to a cyclist in the right lane to move farther from a semi on the left, for instance, prioritizes your safety over the cyclist’s. Leaving that “decision” up to your subconscious becomes its own ethical choice, he added, once “the luxury of deliberation” embodied by the preprogrammed car exists. Human error contributes to an estimated 95 percent of crashes; in theory, automated and connected cars can eliminate our mistakes. “If you recognize that one option is safer,” Shariff says, “and you choose the other option, that’s a moral decision.”

At the moment, V2V merely transfers information without dictating how it is used. But as its reach expands, potentially linking drivers, carmakers and telecommunications companies with state, city and local governments and other private and public interests in a vast network orchestrating the use of what are essentially lethal weapons, questions of responsibility become more complicated. V2V-enabled vehicles would broadcast their size, speed, acceleration and braking activity and location (down to the lane), according to the latest standards. Who will be allowed to access that data? Will it remain anonymous, as automakers currently intend? Who will defend the network against hackers and keep up-to-date the critical software that collects, analyzes and translates that data into best practices for each of its users? Do drivers have the ultimate right to control their cars — even if they want to speed, say — or should the network be programmed to prevent them from doing so? Should it matter whether they’re flooring it because they’re drunk or delivering a pregnant woman in labor to the hospital?

Of course, governments and standards organizations already confront similar utilitarian questions. Early airbags were designed to protect men of average height and weight at the expense of those outside the bell curve; when ambulances run red lights to save a dying patient, they increase the risk of death for everyone around them; a turn-only lane might be safer for bicyclists but worsen vehicle congestion or put a store out of business. Still, each of these decisions can be modified on the micro level by human behavior. The ambulance driver’s experience and his reactions to traffic conditions might mitigate his accident risk. An algorithm applies norms uniformly. Those presets would need to function nationwide, which would require countless entities with conflicting interests and values to submit to a single interpretation of what is best for most people. (Until a majority of cars are fully automated and connected, such a network would most likely behave as the Waze navigation app does, delivering information to human or automated drivers for them to interpret.)

Unfortunately, as a species, humans are notoriously inept at acting in our own long-term interest. Imagine an algorithm for hurricane evacuation that moves cars faster than human drivers would — “balancing the risk of a more-damaging accident from the higher speed against the benefit of getting people out of the evacuation zone faster,” William Whyte, a prominent automotive cybersecurity consultant, wrote to me in an email. “That would be an algorithm that on average worked better than current practice but, when it failed, would fail worse. I think that people would probably feel uncomfortable with that in the same way that they feel uncomfortable on planes — there’s a combination of lack of control plus the fact that if things go wrong, they go very wrong, which triggers all the ways that people are very bad at risk assessment.”

Automation thrives in the absence of regulation; V2V depends on it. The United States Department of Transportation has long helped sponsor V2V research projects: Among the largest is a collaboration between the University of Michigan and the city of Ann Arbor that plans to have 3,150 V2V-equipped cars and 70 connected traffic lights operating there by January. Tampa, New York and the state of Wyoming have won more than $40 million from the agency to implement V2V and other connected-vehicle projects within the next year. At least 41 states have considered legislation surrounding the deployment of automated or V2V technology; at least nine have changed their following-distance laws to permit platooning.

Without federal help, however, the upfront cost of connected infrastructure can be prohibitive for small towns and cities. Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an affiliate scholar at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society, recently challenged a group of students to come up with ways to secure public funding for vehicle-to-infrastructure technology that would enable more governments to afford it. One idea was to use the technology at intersections to collect traffic data and sell it to the developers of automated systems to improve their algorithms; another was to use the dedicated bandwidth in cars to create a meshlike internet network for rural areas, eliminating the need to put down expensive fiber cable.

Perhaps the most provocative idea, Smith told me, was a “crash bounty.” He explained: “We’ve posited that V2I can improve safety — what if you could come up with a scheme for monetizing that? If you could prove you had prevented a crash, you could bill the people who otherwise would have been injured or killed: ‘Good news, we’re 80 percent sure that we saved you from an injury that would have cost you tens of thousands of dollars, so, insurance company, pay up $40,000 and be happy with that.’ ”

To get a sense of how V2V stands to improve the system as a whole, it helps to understand how cities cope without it. To that end, on a recent Monday morning, just after rush hour, I joined Wilson Aleman and Al Vilar, who have been engineers at the Boston Transportation Department for a cumulative five decades, in the Traffic Management Center on the seventh floor of City Hall. Aleman wore a Red Sox cap. Vilar wore glasses with small eyepieces and thick lenses that gave him the look of a jeweler examining a precious stone.

In front of them, a bank of screens displayed live video of various intersections: cars double-parking on narrow, curving roads; pedestrians disregarding stoplights. Aleman could remember when the video screens used to be a board with a real-time LED map on it — and when the department received postmarked letters of complaint instead of tweets, emails and phone calls. Over the last two decades, Boston has connected 68 percent of its lighted intersections to the Traffic Management Center, allowing engineers to adjust the signaling patterns in real time. The department estimates this has reduced travel times by about 15 percent and emissions and crashes by 8 percent each; it also yields economic benefits of approximately $14 million each year, compared with the $318,000 it cost to implement. Still, much of the traffic data — which helps to determine optimal signal timing as well as the city’s future investments — comes from people logging car movements by hand. Widespread V2V would give traffic departments like Boston’s a wealth of detailed information about key locations. (If all cars had V2V, they could blaze through complex intersections without stopping at all, modifying their speeds and headings to slide into gaps.) Maintenance, however, would be a significant challenge.

Aleman showed me his computer monitor, where the connected lights were represented on a city map as red or green dots. The red dots were ones that weather, construction or local hardware issues had taken offline. He pointed to two reds very close together on Commonwealth Avenue that could strand cars between them and block cross-traffic. “Those are the ones I like to attack,” he said. “Those are important to me.” The phone rang. It was a communications specialist who was elbow-deep in a control box on one of Aleman’s corners, working on a surge protector. “Maybe if you unplug one at a time?” Aleman suggested.

On another phone, Vilar was patiently discussing the timing of a new light on Endicott Street at Keany Square with one of the street’s residents. “We’ll get it so it’s working better; right now it’s working safer because there’s less cars coming at you.” He paused. “They’re ready to march on City Hall, I know.” One-way, residential Endicott begins as an offshoot of I-93 North and ends where the causeway and the Charlestown Bridge converge as six lanes. The light makes it slower to turn left. But, Vilar explained once he’d hung up, “we can’t make it beautiful, because then it will siphon off cars from the causeway.”

He pointed to the Endicott video feed where, sure enough, a line of cars was forming. “See, now it’s like 14 cars deep, people honking — you want it to be more serene, especially when you’re eating dinner,” he said. But say those cars weren’t there, and I-93 was backed up, and Google Maps began suggesting Endicott as a shortcut. “So now you’ve got a guy who just got off there, maybe he’s enraged, instead of going 30 he’s going 40, a kid runs out into the street because he’s not used to the traffic being there. ... ” Vilar said. “You want to make it so it’s moving. You want him to think: I’ll be O.K. I don’t want to get off this street. I’ll stay.” A V2V network could make these sorts of intricate adjustments instantly and indefatigably, but it would do so without Vilar’s empathy for the harried commuter or the family conversing over supper.

“Sometimes people call,” he said, “and they just want to rant, and you’re just a punching bag for those people, and that’s part of the job.” Vilar grew up in the North End; he, his wife and his children still live nearby. “The woman who just called, she’s almost like an aunt to me,” he said. “She has my number.”

Traffic may be impersonal, but we experience it intimately. Its smells, sounds and movements are as fundamental to our daily passages as the weather. The transition from horses to cars transformed the nature of cities, Ann Norton Greene writes in her 2008 history, “Horses at Work”: “In the name of safety and efficiency, urban Progressives moved children into supervised urban playgrounds, installed new traffic regulation devices, placed policemen on the streets and encouraged changes that turned streets from spaces in a neighborhood to spaces through a neighborhood.” Vehicles, in this milieu, served as a “protected, private space, an extension of the private home.”

More than a century later, in the context of platooning, privacy seems to be able to foster community as much as disrupt it. The dedicated channel over which one truck controls others allows the drivers to converse exclusively with one another, as opposed to using their C.B. radio, which is rife with vulgar chatter. Dave Mercer used to keep his turned off unless he needed news about road conditions. But during the test run, he and Jake Gregory exchanged frequent notes on moves they planned to make or vehicles that the other couldn’t see; Mercer described it as “Jake and I looking out for each other on the road.”

Might the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues in this way reform the macho trucking culture, increasing the diversity of drivers, only 5.1 percent of whom are women? Or might including more varied perspectives in the design process result in even more innovative applications of V2V? The homogeneity at leading technology companies is well documented. Still, it seems notable, considering how infrastructure and power reinforce each other, that of the several dozen engineers, academics and standards developers I spoke with whose thinking is shaping the future of V2V, most were white and all but one was male.

Artificial systems evolve — just as natural systems do — by applying strict rules to events that are often swayed by chance, and the results are frequently surprising. Relinquishing control of our vehicles to algorithms may ultimately transform us from drivers to passengers who tranquilly observe our surroundings from within our bubble or ignore them altogether in favor of watching a movie or checking email. Then again, by the time that sort of algorithm is ready, more and more of us may choose to depend on ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft for personal travel and delivery services, or even 3-D printing for goods we once needed a car to go get and pay for. “I have three daughters; they’re totally uninterested in driving,” Jack Pokrzywa, director of global ground vehicle standards for SAE International, told me. “When I got my license, I was 17. I was in seventh heaven.”

For those of us for whom a visit to the D.M.V. was a rite of passage, it’s easy to forget that, before Americans found freedom inside a motor vehicle, they found it on foot and astride horses, in covered wagons and trains, on ships, buses, planes, bicycles, roller skates. They found it in pure motion, on a journey to someplace beyond what they could imagine. Where it began and where it ended was still theirs to decide. Likewise, automated connected vehicles stand to make travel safer, maybe even boring, but somebody still has to get in and tell them where to go.",How to Make Cars Cooperate,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/09/magazine/tech-design-autonomous-future-cars-v2v-traffic-peloton.html

In fact, there was no such surge in income after Congress slashed the corporate tax rate in the 1980s; nor was there in Britain as it cut its corporate tax rate in recent years.

So what would true reform look like? First, it would not blow a $1.7 trillion hole in the budget over the next decade, which is what the House plan would do, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Second, it would make the system fairer and more efficient. If Republicans worked with Democrats, they could reach a compromise to lower the top corporate tax rate to between 25 percent and 28 percent, eliminate loopholes and reduce the incentive businesses have to take on debt, rather than to use equity to expand. Under current law, interest is deductible for tax purposes while dividends are not.

Real reform would also include a minimum tax on profits earned abroad by American corporations in the year those profits are earned, minus a credit for taxes paid to other countries. Businesses can now defer taxes on such profits indefinitely, as long as they do not bring the money back to the United States. Big companies like Apple, General Electric and Microsoft have kept an astonishing $2.6 trillion in profits offshore, hoping Congress will lower the tax rate or give them a tax holiday to repatriate the money at ultralow rates. The House bill would let companies bring those profits home at 7 percent (for money invested in hard-to-sell assets) or 14 percent (for cash). A plausible compromise would let businesses repatriate all past profits accumulated overseas at a somewhat discounted rate, say 15 percent to 16 percent. All of this money could be used to rebuild America’s dilapidated infrastructure.

While the outlined changes would solve an immediate problem, Congress also needs to consider longer-term obstacles to tax avoidance by multinational companies. One smart idea that deserves more study is a proposal by economists like Kimberly Clausing, a professor at Reed College. She argues that the United States and other countries ought to tax profits that corporations earn from sales inside their borders, similar to the way American states now tax corporate profits. Each country would control its tax rates, deductions and credits. But companies would lose the ability to game the system by booking profits through subsidiaries registered in zero- or low-tax countries like Bermuda and Luxembourg, where they might be making few sales.

Eventually, Congress will need to do more than just patch the tax system. Even without the Republican tax cut plans, the Congressional Budget Office expects the federal deficit to grow to 5.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, up from 3.2 percent in 2016, thanks in part to the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq war. Lawmakers will need to consider new sources of revenue, including a value-added tax, a carbon tax and a financial transactions tax. Each would broaden the tax base and achieve important policy goals, like encouraging savings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing risks in the financial system.

The Republican proposals do none of these things. They do, however, reward the wealthy. Among the worst offenders is the proposed corporate tax cut, which is larger than needed and does nothing to make the system more efficient.

THE MORNING SCHOOL run proceeds, at first glance, like any number of demographically adjacent — affluent, socially progressive, private — school runs the world over: There are lithe yoga moms, dads with beards and the occasional man bun, kids with Messi jerseys and top-heavy backpacks. There are hurried embraces and pods of parents, to-go lattes in hand, swapping information and gossip. This boisterous procession — from filing past the security guard to the mass exodus when the first-period bell sounds — takes 10 minutes before calm descends.

But at Bali’s Green School , if you look past the familiarities of this ritual, incongruities begin to emerge, as in a spot-the-differences puzzle from a children’s workbook. First, that bell is a gong. Second, there is the incontrovertible fact that the school is in the jungle — some 20 acres of rolling terrain abutting the Ayung (Bali’s longest river) in the district of Abiansemal, about a half-hour southwest of Ubud. Then there’s the fact that almost all of the structures — even the basketball backboards — are made of bamboo. These are no simple huts, but grand, occasionally towering wall-less structures, graceful and whimsical, that resemble some southern extension of “The Lord of the Rings.” Sometimes, during the rainy season, the rain will fall so hard on the roof that the teachers (prefaced with the Balinese honorifics pak or ibu ) temporarily halt lessons because they can’t be heard. Shoes are optional. Students read from the well-stocked (if mildew-prone) library, but they have also built bridges and bamboo bikes — as well as the school playground.

While some schools might employ the word “green” in the context of their LEED-certified building or cafeteria recycling effort, this place takes green to another level. Instead of SUVs, kids might show up in used-cooking-oil-fueled Bio Buses (another project led by students, one of whom recently represented Indonesia at the 2017 Miss World pageant). School lunch is cooked with sawdust fuel from a local bamboo farm, and served on ingka , or straw baskets with a compostable banana-leaf lining. There is a menagerie of rabbits, pigs and chickens. (The fourth-graders took out a loan to buy the chickens, and now raise them and sell their eggs, in a typically immersive Green School introduction to economics.) There’s a food-generating aquaponics facility, and an aviary for the endangered Bali starling. There is the occasional snake — the music teacher found a bright-green viper under the mixing board one morning — but there’s a “snake man” who can be summoned to remove particularly dangerous ones. A mud pit, not far from the kindergarten, is for mepantigan , a Balinese martial art, often practiced in nearby rice fields. Even after the kids have gone to class, one still finds surprising numbers of parents milling about, enticed by the open-air cafe (the best coffee for miles), the biweekly on-site farmer’s market or the chocolate-matcha macaroons at Living Food Lab , a raw restaurant run by a Finnish school parent. Not to mention the Wi-Fi.

And, on a day like the one on which I had arrived, there was a rare Balinese ceremony. Today was the first day of resi gana , a purifying ritual (celebrated every 25 years) for the land upon which the school sits. The teachers, rather than wearing their customary shorts and T-shirts, were in sarongs. Holy men and Balinese royalty had been invited. One element of resi gana — and here, in a fascinating estuarial swirl of cultures, was where the norms of a progressive educational institution met Bali’s uniquely animistic strain of Hinduism — involves animal sacrifice. “They don’t teach you this in administrative school,” said Leslie Medema, the head of school, a straightforward South Dakota native. Through some diplomacy, she was able to arrange for the actual sacrifices to occur off campus. I had absorbed all this information — which I instantly stereotyped as “The Mosquito Coast”-meets-Left Coast — in the first hour of my visit. Stretch this — all this — over the course of a semester and you can begin to imagine what the Green School experience might be like. In the library, I had seen a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book; it seemed the best way to describe what was happening all around. As Melinda Chickering, the school’s academic adviser, told me, “This isn’t for everyone. Some kids are super sensitive. There’s a lot of sound, a lot of color, there are animals. There are a lot of variables here.” Heather Blair, a 2016 Green School graduate now at the New School in New York, says that when she used to lead tours of the school, “people couldn’t even comprehend that it was a school in front of them.” Like visitors to a temple, she says, they would take pictures.

But the element that truly distinguishes Green School is its very premise. Begun a decade ago by John and Cynthia Hardy, jewelry designers and longtime Bali residents, it was intended to do nothing less than create a future generation of “green leaders,” even as it would defy — in form and function — what we know as school itself. In a much-viewed 2010 TED Talk , John Hardy, clad in sarong and sandals, speaks passionately about his own early troubles as a student (owing, in part, to his undiagnosed dyslexia) and how his school differs from a traditional educational institute. That talk, and, more importantly, word of mouth, has lured more than one parent to Bali from as far afield as Malibu, Budapest and São Paulo — and often, unlike “The Mosquito Coast,” it was the kids prompting the decision to come. The Green School was not simply the default option, as it is with other international schools, for expat families employed by nearby multinationals. Today, its student body (consisting of 435 students, from pre-K to high school, across 35 nationalities) has more than quadrupled from its original size. The school has become a sort of bamboo beacon, a pilgrimage site for progressive educators, a stop for TED-circuit global luminaries from Ban Ki-moon to Jane Goodall. “We’re the little school in the jungle that got big,” Medema said.

Its popularity offers the provocative suggestion that the next generation of leaders requires not necessarily math or literature or history — though Green School teaches those too — but a wider set of tools, ranging from adaptability to teamwork to the sort of problem-solving that flourishes under conditions of constraint, which will prove useful in a world whose resources will only continue to diminish. It is a prep school meant to do more than merely prepare students for college, but also equip them with survival skills for an unknown new world, in which proficiency with alternative fuels and sustainable building practices — and the experience of living in a nontraditional, unpredictable environment — might be more useful benchmarks than SAT scores.

FOR ALL ITS idealistic trappings, Green School was founded, initially, on a pragmatic concern. “I wanted to stay in Bali,” John Hardy told me, “and I didn’t have anywhere to send the kids.” John, who grew up in Canada, moved to Ubud in 1975. He met Cynthia in Bali in the ’80s, and their two daughters attended Green School. (Hardy’s other two children, from a previous marriage, were too old to attend by the time the school was founded, though his eldest, Elora, has a Bali-based company that specializes in building with bamboo and helped design several structures at the school.) The local Balinese schools were all about learning “by rote,” he said; at the other end, the traditional expat-driven international schools were a “monoculture” of privilege. The Hardys enlisted local friends and acquaintances, along with some international recruits, and in 2008, Green School was born.

It is not hard to see in John and Cynthia Hardy something of the spirit of Rudolf Steiner — the polymathic, charismatic Austrian whose principles informed the school he created in 1919 for the children of the workers in a German cigarette factory called Waldorf-Astoria. (The name lives on in more than 1,000 Waldorf schools worldwide.) While the Hardys abandoned an early idea to actually start a Steiner school — too much dogma, John told me — the influence remains. Not simply in the Green School’s emphasis on “holistic” (i.e., not strictly academic) development and “experiential” learning, but in highlighting the aesthetics of the classroom. (Steiner once called the schoolroom a “veritably barbaric environment.”)

Kate Druhan, a pragmatic, droll Australian and former human resources manager who serves as the school’s board of management chair, told me the school has cherry-picked its curriculum — a dose of Australia here, some International Baccalaureate there, with a dash of Singapore Math for good measure — and stressed what she called “integrated thematics” across subjects; when learning about ancient Egypt, for example, students will explore its history, but they might also use the pyramids to study geometry. But what most distinguishes Green School from other expat-driven international schools found the world over is its strong connection to the local community, and its emphasis on doing . “At most schools,” Medema said, “you learn about making a bridge in a book. At progressive schools, you maybe make it out of matchsticks or carve it out of soap. At Green School, you actually just go and make it.”

That the school’s model is still in flux may be in the very nature of progressive education, which, going back to Steiner and other pioneers, has defined itself against not only reigning pedagogy, but, to a certain extent, against current society. (For example, Steiner wanted his schools to be free from rigid class boundaries.) But it is not always clear what that means; as Druhan told me, she prefers the word “progressive” to “alternative,” because “you can go in all kinds of directions.” With technology, for example, Medema said, “a lot of parents will come here thinking, I don’t want my kid near any wires — I thought Green School was zero tech.” Another group, she continued, wants facilities that are top-notch, “but in the jungle.”

Ambitiously idealistic experiments often collapse under the weight of their own internal contradictions, and it is certainly possible to find these at Green School: Here are mostly Western, affluent families, many of them temporarily abandoning their comfortable lives for a metaphysical gap year of voluntary simplicity (or life rebalancing or spiritual reawakening) in an exotic stage-setting, at a school whose annual tuition (roughly $15,000 a year for a sixth-grader), while a bargain compared to New York City private-school standards, is far beyond the reach of the average Balinese. (Hardy’s original vision of having at least 20 percent of the school comprised of Balinese scholarship students was, Druhan noted, easier to scale when the school had 90 students. Today, about 9 percent of the student body are on scholarships.) Still, as much as any parent who’s unsure whether his child is getting the best education (in other words, all parents), I surveyed with envy the kids merrily clambering down jungle paths, the river gurgling in the background and the colorful shrines bedecking the hillsides, thinking grimly of my daughter encased in her sealed-window institutional public school building, shunted to the school gym to watch movies on days with a little bit of bad weather.

Faced with a problem involving the school’s hydropower system, the students were working with master’s students at the University of Cologne in Germany to design and build a new system that will combine solar and hydro power. On sunny days, surplus solar power will pump river water up to a holding tank. On cloudy days, that water will be released downhill, powering a turbine. Green School’s students scuba dive with CoralWatch and spend summers as oil-rig hounding “kayaktivists” and attend U.N. climate conferences; they start fashion companies like Nalu (which dedicates a portion of sales to help children buy school uniforms in India and Indonesia) and lobby the Balinese government to reduce the scourge of plastic bags on the island. “They really do want kids to go off and change the world, as clichéd as that sounds,” Blair told me.

BUT EVEN AMID this backdrop of plucky inventiveness and rational reuse, this armature of sustainable skills, was there not only an impulse toward betterment but a small whiff of dystopia — a prep school prepping for a world that is increasingly out of whack? Is the old paradigm really over?

According to Green School parents I spoke to, it is. A variety of “digital nomads,” early retirees, midcareer rebooters and Steiner evangelists, they spoke of being on a shared mission. Regan Williams, who first enrolled as a boarding student (a rarity here; as Medema told me, “You can go to jail for life in Bali for doing teenage stuff”), inspired the rest of her family to come over from Santa Barbara, Calif. Her father, Rob Williams, wrote me over email, “the families are bonded by the fact you have to be a little nuts to move to the middle of the jungle in Bali. … Everyone is sweaty and has bug bites. … Our kids are challenged, engaged and happy.” Alan Fleischmann, a doctor retired from the Mayo Clinic, told me over beers one night that he and his wife Kara chose Green School for their 6-year-old daughter after an exhaustive global search: “We’re trying to work out how you educate for a life in 20 years’ time — what are the skills she might need, and where do you get them?” This being Bali, other factors entered the decision-making process as well. He and his “witchy” wife, as he lovingly termed her, tuned in to Bali, and received a portent of sorts. “You can argue it’s coincidence, but we had a dramatic indication that Mother Bali wanted us here.” As for his daughter’s education, Fleischmann considers skills like memorization largely useless. “I’ve never studied tropical medicine,” he said, though he is often pressed to consult in Bali. “Fifteen minutes on my phone and I know as much as anyone.” At Green School, he said, he saw examples of “project-based management” — “how do you get through something using critical thinking. All that emphasis is not found in a lot of other places.”

Many families, Medema told me, come on the vacation and end up staying for the education. Michael Diamond, a.k.a. Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, who enrolled his two sons (Davis, 15, and Skyler, 13) this year (he and his ex-wife take turns living in Bali), first visited the school at the insistence of Skyler, whose friend had recently enrolled. Diamond was struck by how different it felt from the “traditional boarding school model — you go here because your grandfather went here and then you’re going to go to Yale and then work at this law firm and charge people $500 an hour to argue about nothing.” The sense I had from many Green School parents, echoing the school’s idea of nurturing and developing the whole student, was not only the hope that the school would help make their children better citizens, but would leave them better placed to navigate a world in which values and norms were changing. That the old prep school model might be lacking is not necessarily a progressive thought; the head of Manhattan’s elite Trinity School recently warned in a letter to parents that his institution was in danger of becoming a “credentialing factory,” helping to produce a “cognitive elite that is self-serving, callous and spiritually barren.”

When I asked Druhan if she could sum up Green School in one moment, she paused. One of her strongest memories was when her young son was doing the “rice thematic”— rice being of central economic and cultural import in Bali. His class had gone out in the fields to learn how to grow rice. He raved about the farmer. “He said, ‘Mum, he’s like a scientist! He has so much knowledge, and he doesn’t have even any instruments.”’ The students went on not only to harvest the rice, but cook an elaborate dinner in an underground fire pit, which they served to the farmers, parents and teachers. “That was everything that’s good about Green School in one moment: The hands-on learning, the respect for school values, the connection to the community.” As a tear brimmed, she changed tack. “Then there are other moments,” she said, with a wry smile. “I sat down with my coffee the other day and there were six parents talking about what the best coffee enema was — exactly how it works and the condition of how it came out.

Still, he is taking no chances — his bulging war chest makes him a particularly imposing front-runner.

He will add to it this week as he heads to California, with stops in San Francisco and Beverly Hills, and an itinerary typical of his big-money fund-raising calendar. Donors will be asked for as much as $50,000 to rub shoulders with the governor at the home of Jeff Shell, the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. Other boldfaced names on the invitation include the CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves; the Disney chief, Bob Iger, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks Animation.

Even if Mr. Cuomo ends his 2018 re-election with a sizable surplus, he cannot use his state account to fund a potential presidential campaign because those funds are not transferable. But Mr. Cuomo’s vast network of large donors would be the envy of most politicians, and his patrons could always spend millions on an independent super PAC.

Nonetheless, the overwhelming reliance on big checks makes Mr. Cuomo an outlier even among the best fund-raisers in the country.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, famous for his connections to wealthy donors as a top fund-raiser for the Clintons, raised over $1 million from contributions of $100 or less in his 2013 campaign. Mr. Cuomo has raised around $164,000 in such contributions in his 2010, 2014 and 2018 campaigns — combined.

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas — a Republican who has the most campaign money in the country, $41 million — has raised over $2.8 million from nearly 75,000 contributions of $200 or less since his 2014 re-election, according to his campaign officials.

Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California and a leading Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, has one of the largest campaign treasuries in the nation, with $16 million. In the first six months of 2017, he had 34,096 donors who gave $200 or less, according to his campaign.

Mr. Newsom’s median donation during that period was $10; Mr. Cuomo’s was $2,500. Mr. Newsom raised over $668,000 from such donors, compared to roughly $5,000 for Mr. Cuomo.

“The governor has received contributions of all sizes from thousands of supporters, and these varying donations help bolster his strong progressive agenda to improve the lives of all New Yorkers.” said William J. Mulrow, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign chairman. “We look forward to building on that record in the third term.”

Mr. Cuomo’s campaign account has grown by over $23.6 million since the start of 2015 but only roughly $30,000 came from individual donors who gave less than $200, the federal threshold for disclosure.

“Small-dollar fund-raising and online fund-raising has been a nonnegotiable for both Obama campaigns, for Bernie and Hillary,” said Betsy Hoover, the director of digital organizing for President Obama’s 2012 campaign. “It’s hard to imagine what a serious presidential looks like that doesn’t get that kind of buy-in and participation from a broader swath of donors.”

In the first six months of this year, Mr. Cuomo raised over $5 million, but reported fewer than 100 total small donors who collectively gave less than $5,000. Over that same period, Mr. Cuomo earned far more in interest and dividends on his deposited donations; over $100,000 was paid on June 30.

“It shows who he does appeal to — which is powerful, vested, moneyed interests,” said Stephanie Miner, a Democrat and the mayor of Syracuse who is contemplating challenging Mr. Cuomo in a primary.

If she were to run, Ms. Miner said her campaign would follow “the Bernie Sanders, Howard Dean, Daily Kos model” of seeking small contributions online.

Mr. Cuomo has long resisted investing capital to create a formidable digital footprint for his campaigns, according to past advisers.

“Governor Cuomo set out a transformational plan to restore New York to greatness and has spent three and half years making that plan a reality,” his home page says.

Mr. Cuomo has been governor for nearly seven years.

“Politics changed in the last few years and Andrew Cuomo hasn’t shown that he’s noticed,” said Zephyr Teachout, the then-little-known professor who challenged Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination in 2014. “The deep, legitimate anger at big corporate monopolies is not something Andrew Cuomo understands. In fact, that’s his donor base.”

Past and present advisers to Mr. Cuomo say the governor has long been in his element wooing the wealthy for large checks. In September, he hosted a fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden during a Paul McCartney concert.

In December, Mr. Cuomo is throwing a birthday fund-raiser that will feature former President Bill Clinton and a performance by Jon Bon Jovi. Top-tier access to the event, which includes a private reception with the governor, will cost $50,000.

Mr. Cuomo did hold a relatively rare “grass-roots” event last Thursday at Hudson Terrace in Manhattan with $100 tickets and a “limited number” of $50 spots available.

One reason small donations are so critical for federal races is the far more restrictive giving limits. Presidential candidates can only raise money in $2,700 increments for the primary; in New York, Mr. Cuomo can raise up to $65,100 for his re-election.

Joe Trippi, who served as campaign manager for Mr. Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign, which pioneered raising smaller contributions online, said Mr. Cuomo still has the time and resources to cultivate a small-donor network.

“The requirement to do that is a message that energizes people and they’re excited about,” he said. “We haven’t seen that from him yet.”

Mr. Cuomo has a long way to go to catch up to past presidential contenders’ small donor programs.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hillary Clinton’s campaign raised 18 percent of its funds from donations less than $200; Mr. Obama raised 32 percent of his funds from such donors in 2012. Mr. Sanders raised 87 percent, according to his campaign.

Mr. Cuomo? Just above 0.1 percent.

“You would think, having watched the last three presidential cycles, that if he’s serious about that, that will change,” Mr. Trippi said. “It’s almost like when he updates the website that’s when you know he’s running.

The offering comes with coffee or tea, followed by a croissant and seasonal fruit and rounded out with your choice of a buttermilk waffle, smoked salmon and bagel stack, truffle eggs, or avocado toast.

The prix fixe lunch, which includes a starter and main courses like the Fifth Avenue salad, with Maine lobster, grapefruit and poppyseed dressing, and an olive-oil poached salmon, with caviar and smashed potatoes, costs $39.

But the imposition of money bail has remained a thorny problem and resulted in inequities: Those who can afford to pay it often emerge from custody within days or hours of being charged, while the poor are forced to languish behind bars, at times for months or years, and face a host of collateral consequences, losing their jobs, apartments, sometimes even their children.

There are currently community funds helping to bail out indigent pretrial inmates in at least 10 cities — among them Seattle, Boston and Baltimore. But Ms. Steinberg said that she has been raising money for the national fund for about the last two years and has so far secured nearly $30 million of her $50 million goal from donors like the music industry executive Jason Flom and the billionaire business magnate Richard Branson.

The chairman of the Bail Project’s board will be Michael Novogratz, a longtime hedge fund manager who now runs Galaxy Investment Partners. In an interview last week, Mr. Novogratz said that he decided to take part in the project after learning from Ms. Steinberg that on any given night, almost 450,000 poor defendants are locked in jails nationwide without even having been convicted of a crime.

“It leaves you outraged,” he said. “Even with $50 or $60 million, we’re only going to put a dent in things and hopefully change attitudes about cash bail. It’s a monster problem.”

The Bail Project plans to deploy two experts called “bail disrupters” to each of the cities it will work in and have them serve in a partnership with local public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates to interview and discover potential clients. Aside from paying bail on behalf of the poor, the national fund, Ms. Steinberg said, will also seek to address a lack of data on the issue by collecting information on what sorts of defendants end up held on bail, as well as on the socioeconomic costs of pretrial detention.

According to one report released last month by the Prison Policy Initiative, which advocates for inmates, women who could not make bail had a median annual income of slightly more than $11,000. This month, the Pretrial Justice Institute, which studies bail and works to reform the system, released a national report card grading states on their bail programs: 17 states received F’s; only one state, New Jersey, received an A.

New Jersey is indeed among a handful of states, like Georgia, Texas and New Mexico, that have recently sought to curtail — and in some cases end — the practice of imposing money bail. But these separate efforts at reform have occasioned a coordinated pushback from the bail industry, which fears its profits are in jeopardy.

Ms. Steinberg said that 96 percent of the people in the Bronx whose bail was paid by her local fund in the last 10 years returned to court for all of their appearances. If that statistic could be replicated nationwide, she added, the national fund could exist in perpetuity as the money given to help clients close their cases returns to the kitty for future use.

Ms. Steinberg also noted that remaining in jail without paying bail can affect the results of criminal proceedings. In New York, she said, more than 90 percent of those who cannot pay bail and stay locked up until their cases are concluded end up pleading guilty. But more than half of her clients in the Bronx who were freed on bail, she said, had their cases dismissed by prosecutors once they were released.

For all its depiction of a world spinning off its axis, “Albion” affords the pleasures of a vintage, soul-searching British novel.","This may sound like a joyless prospect. But it’s amazing how quickly the traffic of the stage passes when you’re in the hands of expert craftsmen.

Neither Mr. Graham’s “Labour of Love” (at the Noël Coward Theater in the West End) nor Mr. Bartlett’s “Albion” (at the Almeida in Islington) is likely to be the work for which either dramatist will be best remembered. But seen at a moment in which the center of a classically self-contained world no longer seems to be holding, these fraught works exude a paradoxical reassurance.

There is warming solace, after all, in people gathering to hear their collective identity crisis discussed in such well-spoken terms. (This is true even for uneasy Americans like me, whose own viciously conflicted nation has been keeping them awake at nights.)

Theatergoers here will recognize such plays as part of a long tradition of literary introspection. It is one that stretches back to at least the days of that other Queen Elizabeth, when Shakespeare’s characters tear out their hair over their imperiled country’s divisions, and has been sustained by 20th- and 21st-century writers including John Osborne, David Hare and Caryl Churchill.

What’s more, though their subjects may be absolutely of the moment, “Labour of Love,” an anxious comedy, and “Albion,” a state-of-the-nation drama, are both old-fashioned in form. This is not necessarily to be expected of either of their creators.

Mr. Bartlett is the author of the future Shakespearean history play “King Charles III”; Mr. Graham wrote the interactive “Privacy,” about reality-fracturing practices in the age of surveillance. Despite a few postmodern flourishes and some teasing structural game playing, their latest offerings are unlikely to disconcert habitual watchers of “Masterpiece” television.

Directed by Jeremy Herrin (“Wolf Hall,” “People, Places & Things”), “Labour of Love” is a detailed examination of the history of the British Labour Party. But wait. It is also a spirited battle-of-the-sexes comedy in the vein of “Much Ado About Nothing” and the films that pitted Katharine Hepburn against Spencer Tracy.

In this case, though, the salt-of-the-earth Tracy character is a woman, Jean Whittaker, a longtime stalwart of the local party in a working-class mining town. The patrician Hepburn type is a rising politician, with a public school accent and impeccably tailored suits.

That’s David Lyons (a top-form Martin Freeman, of “Sherlock” fame). He has been delivered, more or less by central party fiat, into a “safe seat” in the constituency where Jean (the wonderful Tamsin Greig) has worked as the office manager for the outgoing member of Parliament (who happens to be her husband). She has no intention of sticking around.

But of course she does, and leftist Old Labour (think Tony Benn) butts heads with centrist New Labour (think Tony Blair), amid plenty of sparks and quips over 27 years. I should note that the play begins on an election night in 2017, when it seems as if David is going to lose, and works backward to the day he arrived to first assume his Parliamentary position in 1994.

That’s the first act, anyway. The second act reverts to conventional chronology, beginning in 1994 and picking up where each scene in the previous act ended. The structure embodies the play’s central and cleverly executed motif of mirror images.

I’m making the plot sound more complicated than it feels. Interspersed with time-capsule video montages that show the changing faces of British government, the production moves with the barbed breeziness of an Alan Ayckbourn comedy.

Yes, Labour policies, strategies, economics and even iconography are discussed at length. But as he demonstrated in his gripping parliamentary procedural docudrama, “This House,” Mr. Graham has a gift for finding the human crackle in ostensibly dry political business.

It is a battle to which Mr. Freeman and Ms. Greig lend a deliciously combustible chemistry. And though the divided Britain of 2017 inspires lamentations about a party — and a nation — at war within itself, “Labour” dares to end on a note of guarded but cheering optimism.

The same can hardly be said of “Albion,” which is directed by Rupert Goold and stars a splendid Victoria Hamilton (of Netflix’s “The Crown”). The titular setting is the once magnificent garden of an English estate, long since fallen into disuse and decay.

Albion once belonged to the uncle of Audrey Walters (Ms. Hamilton), the self-made head of a home furnishings empire and a bereaved mother whose soldier son was killed in Iraq. She is determined to restore it to its former glory. She is also, of course, hoping to resurrect an England of long ago, of material solidity and a clear-cut social structure.

It isn’t a spoiler to say that this project is inevitably doomed. An end-of-days tone of Chekhovian melancholy pervades the show from its opening moments.

And Mr. Bartlett borrows unapologetically from both Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard” and “The Seagull” for his portrayal of the characters here. They include Audrey’s benignly parasitic husband (an excellent Nicholas Rowe); her best friend, a swaggering and emotionally destructive novelist (Helen Schlesinger); and Audrey’s dangerously impressionable daughter (Charlotte Hope), who has artistic leanings of her own.

The fact that there is no place in contemporary Britain for the Albion of yore is explored in clashes among classes and generations. These are enacted in dialogue that, by Mr. Bartlett’s standards, often feels surprisingly banal, as if recycled from a century’s worth of country house dramas.

But Mr. Goold’s production, featuring a deceptively simple design by Miriam Buether, has been most engagingly staged. (The ways in which the garden comes to life is a marvel.) And the acting, especially from Ms. Hamilton, is passionate and persuasive.

For all its depiction of a world spinning off its axis, “Albion” affords the pleasures of a vintage, soul-searching British novel. In asking the question of who will inherit what remains of the British Empire, it brings to mind one literary classic in particular. And when I turned on the television the next night, there on the screen was a new adaptation of that very work.

I mean E. M. Forster’s 1910 masterpiece, “Howards End.” Watching this latest incarnation of one of my favorite books, I found it exasperating, poignant and comforting that more than a hundred years ago, Forster was posing the same questions about his country’s identity and purpose that haunted the plays I had just seen.","On London Stages, Britain Considers Its Divided Soul",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/theater/labour-of-love-albion-london.html

Recipe: Braised Chicken With GochujangMany of the Finger Lakes cabernet franc wines exhibited restrained fruit, whispers of spice and musky smoke in a brooding package.","For the Finger Lakes, though, it was a sound decision. The critical acclaim for its rieslings has fed a growth in production and the arrival of new producers.

By 2011, the last year for which New York kept records of grape acreage, riesling was by far the region’s most planted of white vinifera grapes, the European species that accounts for all the familiar fine-wine grapes. Even so, the region still has many acres of hybrid and native American grapes, like concord and Niagara, a legacy of its history both as a producer of cheap fortified wines and of small wineries that did the bulk of their business selling directly to visitors.

Still, few regions in the world flourish with only one signature wine. For as long as riesling has prospered in the Finger Lakes, winemakers there have debated what its red counterpart ought to be.

I’ve had charming pinot noirs, made in a fresh, delicate style rather than with opulent fruit. I’ve had intriguing teroldegos and blaufränkisches. Yet the most consistently good and distinctive reds I’ve had from the Finger Lakes have been cabernet francs.

In the last five years or so, I have seen more cabernet francs from the region. It has not been a lot — cab franc acreage accounts for less than a third of riesling acreage — but enough to notice.

As with riesling, focusing on cab franc is not at all a marketing no-brainer. It’s the other cabernet, the one without a clear identity and name recognition. The easy path is not necessarily the best path, as was true with riesling, so maybe cabernet franc, too, makes sense.

Seeking a deeper understanding of Finger Lakes cabernet franc, the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles primarily from the 2014 and ’15 vintages, with one ’16 thrown in. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Christy Frank — who, with her husband, owns Copake Wine Works in Columbia County, N.Y. — and Thomas Pastuszak, wine director of the NoMad.

Thomas and his wife, Jessica Brown, also happen to own a small Finger Lakes label, Terrassen Cellars, that makes cabernet franc. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, was unaware of the connection and included a bottle in our blind tasting. To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, we did not include it in our rankings.

As we tasted through the 20 bottles, a clear profile of Finger Lakes cabernet franc emerged. These wines were pale in color, savory and spicy, more than sweetly fruity. Indeed, the fruit flavor tended more toward the tart end of the spectrum, leavened with herbal and mineral touches.

These wines spoke plainly of cool-climate viticulture, a phrase often bandied about by regions that have little claim to it. Yet it is a true description of conditions in the Finger Lakes, where alcohol levels only occasionally rise above 13 percent, compared with the 14 percent to 15 percent seen regularly in California. The best cabernet francs were light- to medium-bodied with almost delicate textures and lively acidity, the sort that would go especially well on the Thanksgiving table.

“People are looking for more food-friendly wines,” Thomas said. “Cool-climate cabernet franc will appeal to those seeking mineral-driven, acid-driven, more firmly tannic wines.”

It’s certainly a lovely, desirable style, though perhaps not mainstream American yet.

“Up in Copake, a lot of people want something local,” Christy said. “But they also want something that’s big and rich, so it’s a fine line.”

As a sommelier, Thomas has tried to pique his customers’ interest in NoMad’s excellent selection of Finger Lakes wines.

“I used to say, ‘Think of a lighter version of cabernet sauvignon,’” he said. “Now I say, ‘A spicier version of pinot noir.’ It’s been more successful in terms of peoples’ expectations.”

Our top wine, a 2014 from Lakewood Vineyards, epitomized the prevailing Finger Lakes style. The wine was fresh, with an almost crunchy texture and nuanced, savory flavors of flowers, herbs and spicy fruit. By contrast, our No. 2 bottle, a 2015 Le Breton from Schneider & Bieler, was darker and more concentrated than many of the other wines. It nonetheless was well balanced, with the typical tart, herbal flavors.

No. 3 was the 2014 Wisdom from Inspire Moore, a deliciously saline, savory mouthful, with flavors of both tart and sweet fruit. No. 4 was the 2014 North Block Six from Atwater Estate, floral and herbal, with a kind of tense energy to it.

Other wines well worth trying include the savory 2014 Hermann J. Wiemer; the floral, earthy 2015 Damiani; the spicy, refreshing 2016 Hosmer and the delicate but deep 2015 Keuka Lake Vineyards.

Almost any of these bottles is an excellent value. None of our favorites cost more than $25.

A few cabernet franc-based wines like Bloomer Creek’s excellent White Horse were not included in our tasting because they didn’t meet the 75 percent threshold for using the name of the grape on the label. Perhaps we were being arbitrary, but it was how we narrowed the field.

The focus on riesling and cabernet franc is not to say that the Finger Lakes do not produce many other fine wines. I’ve had good chardonnays and gamays. I’ve enjoyed pinot noirs. And the sommelier Pascaline Lepeltier has recently teamed with Nathan Kendall, of N. Kendall, to make Chëpìka, an intriguing pétillant naturel made of the native grapes Catawba and Delaware.

It’s the kind of experimentation that suggests a serious exploration of the region’s potential. It will only get better from here.

Recipe: Braised Chicken With Gochujang

Many of the Finger Lakes cabernet franc wines exhibited restrained fruit, whispers of spice and musky smoke in a brooding package. The wines could handle food with some complexity and heat, so I turned to a slow braise, which infuses meat with deep flavor and produces a warming, stewlike dish. It’s the cooking method of choice when the weather brings a chill. The process is what I call the usual three-step affair (brown chicken parts or meat, add other ingredients and some liquid, cover and slowly simmer). But I gave the chicken a bit of heat, unpacking the Korean condiment gochujang with sake, ginger, garlic and some well-mannered poblano chiles. The finished dish would welcome a pillow of steamed rice alongside. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Most recently, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all admitted that the Russian government had used their platforms last year to pose as American voters and spread divisive propaganda. Under fire from Congress, all the companies pledged to police their sites more carefully in the future.

Born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, Mr. Awlaki spent half his life in the United States and spoke excellent English. As a popular young imam in Denver, San Diego and a Washington, D.C., suburb, he recorded lecture series that were eventually best sellers among Western Muslims — notably his 53-CD boxed set on the life of the Prophet Muhammad.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president of Iran from 2005 to 2013, introduced a program to build low-income housing, including in Pol-e Zahab. After the quake on Sunday, his political opponents said that many of the buildings had been poorly constructed, but his defenders said that the buildings were on fault lines, and that nothing could have been done.

Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, roughly 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage.

Ali Namiq, a resident of the town Darbandikhan, Iraq, said a building was flattened by the quake. “The building fell on a seven-member family,” he told Reuters. “We managed to rescue only five out of them, while the two others were killed. It was the first time for me to see an earthquake. It is a divine act that no one can prevent.”

In the town of Kalar, Iraq, the quake sent items tumbling from shelves in a supermarket, causing shoppers to flee.

The quake occurred about 20 miles south of the Iraqi city of Halabja, where Saddam Hussein’s government launched a poison gas attack that killed more than 5,000 people, mostly Kurds, on March 16, 1988, in the closing days of the Iran-Iraq war.

The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Karbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake.

Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people.

“Whoa, whoa — this is not the press statement,” Mr. Duterte said. “We are in a bilateral meeting.”

“You are the spies,” he told the reporters, as Philippine security personnel jostled some of them roughly. The remarks elicited a hearty laugh from Mr. Trump before the journalists were led out of the room.

Mr. Roque later said Mr. Trump focused during the roughly 40-minute session on concerns about tariffs being imposed on American vehicles but not Japanese cars. Mr. Duterte, for his part, thanked the United States for its help in dealing with the conflict in Marawi, the southern city where Philippine forces clashed with militants trying to seize territory.

On the streets of Manila, meanwhile, a phalanx of about a hundred riot police officers with shields and truncheons clashed Monday with about 300 protesters as they marched near the American Embassy.

The protesters carried anti-American placards and a likeness of Mr. Trump with a Hitler-like mustache. They were later pushed back with water cannons.

White House officials have said that Mr. Trump has a “warm rapport” with Mr. Duterte, with whom he has spoken and exchanged letters since taking office, and that he wants to mend the American-Philippine alliance after strains during the Obama administration.

“President Trump specifically said he has always been a friend of the Duterte administration, unlike the previous administrations of the United States,” Mr. Roque said on Monday. “He stressed that he can be counted upon as a friend of the Duterte administration.”

Mr. Trump raised eyebrows in April by inviting Mr. Duterte to the White House during what American officials called a “very friendly conversation” on the phone in which the president praised the Philippine leader’s efforts to rid his country of drugs.

Mr. Duterte has been accused of ordering thousands of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in what human rights groups condemn as a bloody campaign that has targeted many who may have nothing to do with narcotics.

On Sunday evening, he made a public show of his affection for Mr. Trump, grabbing a microphone during the gala dinner to sing the Philippine love ballad “Ikaw,” a serenade he said he had performed “upon the orders of the commander in chief of the United States.” A Philippine official later tweeted about the song, reportedly a favorite of Mr. Duterte’s, which includes the lyric, “You are the love I’ve been waiting for.”

Mr. Trump’s encounter earlier in the day with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia was somewhat scratchier, albeit in a mostly playful way. As the two leaders stood alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, Mr. Trump repeated his vow to eliminate trade deficits that he said the United States ran with “almost everybody.”

“Except us,” Mr. Turnbull interjected.

“Except with you,” Mr. Trump agreed, to titters in the room. “You’re the only one. And if I check it, I’ll probably find out that was …”

“Oh, no,” Mr. Turnbull said. “It’s real.”

The United States, in fact, has run a $10.3 billion trade surplus with Australia in the nine months of this year and has consistently exported more to Australia than it has imported for the last decade.

Since taking office, Mr. Duterte has pivoted away from the United States, a longtime treaty ally, and toward China. The separation took on a more personal flavor before last year’s meeting of the group, known as Asean, in Laos. Then Mr. Duterte used a slur to refer to President Barack Obama when he was asked how he would react if Mr. Obama raised human rights concerns with him. The episode prompted Mr. Obama to cancel a formal meeting with Mr. Duterte at the summit meeting, though the two did talk informally.

Still, Mr. Duterte continued to distance himself, calling for a “separation” between the countries and threatening to scrap an agreement that allows American troops to visit the Philippines.

Trump administration officials have said Mr. Trump wants to improve relations with the Philippines as a bulwark against China’s expansionism in the South China Sea. The Philippines has clashed with China over disputed reefs and shoals in the waterway, which the two countries share, and Mr. Trump has used this month’s Asia tour to offer to, as he said on Sunday in Hanoi, “mediate or arbitrate” such disagreements.

But neither side mentioned the issue in their readouts of the meeting on Monday, and Mr. Duterte has played down the disputes this week, saying that China’s rapidly expanding economy has overtaken that of the United States and that a territorial confrontation would not be worthwhile.

“Today, China is the No. 1 economic powerhouse, and we have to be friends,” Mr. Duterte told Asean leaders on Sunday.

He said that while “the other hotheads” would like confrontation, “the South China Sea is better left untouched.”

PARIS — If you thought it was challenging for women to come forward and accuse Harvey Weinstein of rape, consider accusing the Islamic theologist Tariq Ramadan. Emboldened by the enormous response in France to the #MeToo wave that was born in Hollywood, two Frenchwomen decided last month to sue Mr. Ramadan for rape and sexual abuse. One of the women, Henda Ayari, has gone public. The second has described her ordeal to journalists but has remained anonymous. And for good reason: Henda Ayari has had to appeal for help after becoming the target of a vicious campaign of insults and slander on social networks, mostly from Muslim extremists. Mr. Ramadan, a grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, denies the accusations.

It is not only that the Swiss-born Mr. Ramadan, 55, who has taken a leave of absence from Oxford University, where he has taught contemporary Islamic studies (a chair financed by Qatar), is a prominent figure on the intellectual and religious Islamic scene in France. What makes his accusers particularly brave is that they, like him, are practicing Muslims. By the very fact of having spent time alone with him, they have, in the eyes of rigorist teachings of Islam, violated the rules of modesty that women are required to follow.

The sexual revolution that liberated Western women in the 20th century has yet to occur in most of the Muslim world. But we may be seeing a beginning, six years after the crushed hopes of the Arab revolutions. In North Africa, at least, and in the Arabic communities within France, the seeds of women’s rebellion are bearing fruit slowly. Tunisia, the one Arab country that did not turn its back on the Arab Spring, is breaking barriers.

“In Arabic, revolution means whirlwind,” the Tunisian film director Kaouther Ben Hania, a woman, recently told the French public radio channel France-Inter. “So it turns everything upside down, it changes everything, and overnight we find ourselves talking about everything, while under the dictatorship we did not talk. I would never have been able to do this movie before the revolution.”

Just released in France and in her country, Ms. Ben Hania’s movie “The Beauty and the Dogs” is a harrowing tale of a 20-year-old student raped by two policemen in Tunis after being caught walking on a beach with a boyfriend at night. The film concentrates on the night that follows, during which Mariam, the student, tries stubbornly to file a complaint, which would require getting a doctor to examine her and policemen to take her testimony. Gradually, as hours pass and she encounters more obstacles, her violated dignity leads to a political awakening. Threatened with arrest at dawn, she does not give in. In the end, Ms. Ben Hania explains, “it is the policemen who are afraid of her.

I know what you’re thinking — psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces — but I am being literal. When we ponder America’s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies’ independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse.

The battle isn’t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn.

But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn’t about military strategy I wasn’t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people’s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals’ heads and hearts.

George Washington is everyone’s touchstone for the Revolution, and I made him mine as well. To orient myself alongside the commander of the American Army in New York, I began at “the commons,” now City Hall Park, joining municipal workers on the benches at lunch hour. On July 9, 1776, as British soldiers were gathering on Staten Island and preparing to attack Manhattan, Washington arrayed his troops here and had the newly minted Declaration of Independence read aloud to them. The men were so roused up they charged southward and pulled down the statue of King George at what is now Bowling Green.

But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments.","When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order.

But the N.F.L. installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals.

The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men. But as a result, the players now accuse the nation’s richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all.

“Players will be shorted what they earned,” said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinson’s disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing. “This is not a settlement. This is about paying sick men as little as possible.”

Stewart, who was in the league from 1989-93 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinson’s diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L. benefit plans. But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.

Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, planned to meet with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs’ chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently.

“Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up,” said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the league’s legal cases. “Unfortunately, the N.F.L. has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.”

Orrin Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise. He said that players are now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement.

He said the bulk of the claims that have been sent back to players were for missing paperwork. But another group of claims have been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined.

Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion. But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.

“It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork,” Brown said. “But there’s nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this. The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.”

The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each — though most will likely receive far less — for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field. A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they can submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously.

Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had “growing pains” because of unanticipated problems. In this case, some former players have “pushed the envelope,” he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records.

By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address “some funny things that didn’t look right,” and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Seeger said.

Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L. of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.

“Is this working perfectly? No,” Seeger said. But “if there aren’t sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem. The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion. Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.”

Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation. The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts.

“I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics,” said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players. “There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims. Basically, they’re saying you need to start all over again, even if you have a pre-existing diagnosis” recognized by an N.F.L. benefit plan.

All 35 claims Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of “deficiencies,” he said. Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited.

Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L. players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies.

“The settlement was sold by the N.F.L. and Seeger as quick pay,” Luckasevic said. “This was something everyone feared. This is the N.F.L. disability plan version 2.0.”

The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it denies that stricter requirements were added after the deal was made final.

“There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized,” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims.

The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L. under one of it regular disability plans. The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral.

Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L. will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits.

Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable. He was found to have Parkinson’s disease in 2009, when he was 43.

Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement. But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.

The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football.

After Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis. But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four.

In the settlement, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award. But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then.

Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career. But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing — often with the aid of painkillers — so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day.

In many ways, the N.F.L. case is different from many settlements, experts said. Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt. In the N.F.L. settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S.

Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players’ lawyers — many of whom receive a percentage any settlement — have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L. to be alert to fraud, experts said.

Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million. But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments. In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L. insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims.

But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud.

Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he has handled, defendants have a right to try to prevent fraud. But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlement.

“It’s not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door,” said Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L. case. “All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.”",Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/sports/football/nfl-concussion-lawsuit.html

The Supreme Court on Monday also agreed to decide whether a Minnesota law that bars political buttons and badges at polling places on Election Day is constitutional. Voters affiliated with the Tea Party said the law infringed on their right to free speech.

The case, Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, No. 16-1435, started when Andrew Cilek was temporarily prevented from voting while wearing a T-shirt that said “Don’t Tread on Me” and bore a Tea Party logo. He also wore a button that said “Please I.D. Me.”

He and others challenged the law on free speech grounds, saying that the government may not bar apparel that merely conveyed a philosophy rather than an endorsement of a particular candidate, party or ballot measure.

The Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, upheld the law. “Even if Tea Party apparel is not election-related, it is not unreasonable to prohibit it in a polling place,” Judge Duane Benton wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. “In order to ensure a neutral, influence-free polling place, all political material is banned.”

In 1992, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that barred soliciting votes and distributing campaign material within 100 feet of polling places.

The challengers in the Minnesota case argued that the state’s law is broader, crossing a constitutional line.

“‘Speech-free zones’ cannot be reconciled with the First Amendment’s free speech clause,” the challengers told the justices in their brief seeking review. “Although this court has permitted campaign-free zones that prohibit campaign materials and active solicitation, it has never endorsed a ban on all political speech.”

The Navy SEALs’ potential role threatens to tarnish SEAL Team 6, the famed counterterrorism unit that carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Until now, the biggest unanswered question in the case has been why Sergeant Melgar was killed. But new clues are emerging on that front.

An American service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said he was under the impression that the sergeant had stumbled on some sort of money-skimming scheme involving the Navy commandos. A retired senior enlisted sailor who served in SEAL Team 6 said Sergeant Melgar discovered the scam and threatened to report the Navy commandos to the authorities. Sergeant Melgar’s suspicions were first reported in the Daily Beast.

Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the sergeant’s death remains under investigation. A spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Ed Buice, declined to comment on the homicide investigation.

Special Operations troops from a range of units can earn qualifications that let them recruit sources for intelligence and pay them. These individuals may handle payments from small cash bags up to storage lockers filled with currency.

Cash from funds to pay informants has a way of going missing, military officials said. Skimming money from funds, which in Mali could be as much as $20,000 at any given time, is relatively easy because the service members are often dealing with sources who are illiterate and cannot sign their names to a receipt. This allows an unscrupulous person to create a bogus receipt with the equivalent of an “X” for a signature, military officials said.

One of the first missions to draw broad public attention to the secretive Navy SEAL Team 6 unit was its dramatic rescue in April 2009 of Capt. Richard Phillips after Somali pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama cargo ship. Snipers from the unit’s Red Squadron shot and killed three of the pirates in a small rescue boat.

The criminal complaint against the surviving pirate, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, describes how Captain Phillips gave roughly $30,000 in cash from the safe aboard the Maersk to the pirates, money that soon disappeared. Captain Phillips later recalled leaning against a sack with the money inside on the lifeboat. When Navy personnel searched the lifeboat, all they found were guns, ammunition, cellphones and radios. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service gave the SEALs polygraph tests about the missing money but could never prove where the $30,000 had gone, and the case was closed. No SEAL from that mission is involved in the Mali case.

Much is unknown about what happened around 5 a.m. June 4 in the house that Sergeant Melgar shared with another Army Green Beret and the two Navy commandos.

The SEALs were in the country on a clandestine mission to support French and Malian counterterrorism forces battling Al Qaeda’s branch in North and West Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as smaller cells aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The Americans helped provide intelligence for missions, and had participated in at least two such operations in Mali this year before Sergeant Melgar’s death. Over all, about two dozen American troops operate in Mali at any given time, mostly to help on training and counterterrorism missions.

SEAL Team 6, formally known as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, has over the past decade carried out kill-or-capture missions in Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, as well as the one that killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.

According to one version of events surrounding the death in Mali, from a military official, one of the SEALs put Sergeant Melgar in a chokehold. When the sergeant passed out, the commandos frantically tried to revive him. Failing that, they rushed him to an emergency clinic, where he was pronounced dead.

The service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said that the sergeant’s chain of command immediately grew suspicious when the initial incident reports said the death was the result of a drunken accident. His friends and superiors knew Sergeant Melgar did not drink.

One of the SEAL commandos under investigation is Petty Officer Tony E. DeDolph, a former professional mixed martial arts fighter, according to two military officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. His identity was reported by The Intercept.

Petty Officer DeDolph and the second Navy commando, who has not been identified, were flown out of Mali shortly after Sergeant Melgar’s death and were placed on administrative leave at the unit’s headquarters in Dam Neck, Va.

Sergeant Melgar, a graduate of Texas Tech University who joined the Army in 2012, was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., the same unit whose soldiers were attacked by a much larger and heavily armed group of Islamic State fighters near the border between Niger and Mali on Oct. 4.

Sergeant Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Tex., was about four months into what military officials said was a six-month tour in Mali. He was part of a small crisis-response team in Bamako assigned to help provide intelligence about Islamic militants in Mali to the United States Embassy to help protect its personnel against attacks. The sergeant also helped assess which Malian Army troops might be trained and equipped to build a counterterrorism force.

“We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members,” the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July. “While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn’t worth it.”

The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats — and, by definition, two middle seats — rather than three.

But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isn’t enough space. “The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight you’re going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 — no way can you do four-three,” he said.

Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding. But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.

“We’ve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller,” he said. “We’ve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems,” leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.

“The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space that’s left over for the passenger,” Mr. Pozzi said.

Or, as the case may be, for more passengers. “Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two,” said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com. “The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldn’t.”

“Now,” he added, “you’re cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space. It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.”

On American Airlines’ new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches. Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running. The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch. A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.

“If you just go by inches, it’s kind of an old measure. We’re kind of basing it on comfort level and the way we’ve engineered our seats,” he said. “While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.

But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort. One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch. The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A. in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as “the incredible shrinking airline seat.”

Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns. Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.

“Obviously, if you’re squeezed into a very confined space, it’s going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency,” Mr. Hudson said.

“The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds,” he said. “Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.”

The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary. Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, “All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.”

But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.

“It won’t be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety,” Mr. Counter said.

Mr. Harteveldt agreed. “There may be a legitimate issue around safety,” he said. “That’s why we’re now starting to see this topic bubble up.”",Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/airline-seat.html

Meet Marla Maples, the mistress Ivana refers to as “the showgirl.” Ivana divulges nothing of what was said in the heat of the ensuing battle with her husband back at the chalet, one of the many frustrating cloth-drops over the parrot cage in this book. The marital rupture inflicted a string of indignities on Ivana as the New York tabloids engaged in dueling headlines, the most infamous being Maples’s “Best Sex I Ever Had” boast on the front page of The Post. With her faint air of Zsa Zsa Gabor and madcap aplomb, Ivana aerated Trump’s persona during their marriage — gave his brash, crass excess a dash of dynasty dazzle and camp. Once their partnership was sundered, Ivana took her blithe esprit and comic malaprops to enjoy the high life elsewhere (“In 2006, my yacht was parked at Cannes for the film festival, and I was having a party with two hundred people on it”), a pity since she might have been a more inspiriting first lady than the inscrutable, animatronic Melania. As someone who grew up in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and witnessed Russian tanks crushing the Prague Spring, Ivana would have been more sensitive and perhaps even resistant to Russian interference than our current White House has been. Hurt and humiliated as she was by Donald’s infidelity, however, Ivana remains a loyalist, proclaiming, “I believe he’ll be a great president,” perhaps the first in a family dynasty. Of Ivanka, she suggests, “Who knows? One day, she might be the first female — and Jewish — POTUS.” I’vana throw up.

The subtitle to Jerry Oppenheimer’s “The Kardashians: An American Drama” evokes the panoramic scope and muted trumpets of a Ken Burns epic, but crack open the book and the whiff of cheese is unmistakable. It’s almost comforting knowing that we are in the able, busy hands of a veteran journeyman with few pretensions to subtlety, scene-painting and the stately march of history. The author of biographies of the Clintons, Rock Hudson, Anna Wintour, Martha Stewart, Barbara Walters and other two-legged notables, Oppenheimer doesn’t doodle around — he hacks away. The prologue kicks off with a classic bit of ooga-booga involving a Christian prophetess who told the then-obscure lawyer Robert Kardashian that, in his words, “one day my name, the Kardashian name, would be known around the world.” And, lo, the curse came to pass. On June 17, 1994, the day that the white Ford Bronco chase covered live from coast to coast entered American lore, Robert Kardashian — friend, legal defender and personal exculpator of the former football great and “Naked Gun” co-star O.J. Simpson — read aloud his client’s rambling letter of professed innocence concerning the slashing homicides of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman to a locust swarm of international press. He was identified on TV screens as “Robert Kardashian, Simpson Friend,” and from that moment the “Kardashian” name has become pop culture’s most persistent rash. Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob and their half sisters, Kendall and Kylie … all those freaking Kardashians, but the K who counts the most is, of course, Robert’s then-wife, Kris: Kristen Houghton Kardashian and the future Kris Jenner — schemer, dreamer, mother, impresario and “cougar extraordinaire.” It was she who would convert Kardashian from an instant household name into a self-perpetuating media brand and meme.

It can’t be said that Oppenheimer is in Kris’s corner as she bops her way to the top. Even as a high schooler she’s tagged as a “shallow opportunist,” and the chapter where the teenage Kris meets her first lover, a 28-year-old professional golfer, is titled “Hole in One.” Her marriage to Robert in 1978 would have been a parodic misalliance under balmier circumstances. For most readers, Ira Levin’s 1972 best-selling novel “The Stepford Wives” was a satire and cautionary tale; for the future Mrs. Kardashian, the 1975 thriller movie it inspired was a training manual. While dating Kris, Robert insisted that she listen to instructional audiocassettes to stock the bare pantry of her mind with knowledge, mistakenly assuming she would be an obedient helpmate. Unfortunately for this, Kris’s favorite mini-series was “The Thorn Birds,” that passion-tossed ’80s show about forbidden love in the kangaroo outback.

Despite these premarital misgivings, they wed and dutifully reproduced, but this Beverly Hills housewife was never going to relegate herself to hostess duty. Living large and spending big, Kris outfitted herself with fake boobs after seeing Nicole Simpson’s new pair (“I thought, I want two of those, please!”), and cheated on her husband with a young soccer player (“You can be a good mother and still be a tramp,” as one interested bystander puts it, words to live by). Divorce follows, and Robert Kardashian’s life becomes one sad, long, dribbling anticlimax. Basking in the celebrity glory of membership in O. J.’s dream team, after the shocking acquittal he found himself shunned, mocked and blackballed, and a couple of marriages later he died at age 59 from esophageal cancer. Meanwhile, Kris flourishes still, her subsequent union with the former Olympian Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn) supplying a second-stage booster rocket to the Kardashian brand.

Kim’s infamous sex tape with her then-boyfriend Ray J provided the initial liftoff. Modestly titled “Kim Kardashian, Superstar,” it surfaced in 2007, the same year that the reality series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” debuted on E!, executive-produced by the inescapable Ryan Seacrest and with Kris presiding as the “momager” of this ever-expanding family enterprise. One sympathizes with Oppenheimer as he tries to keep track of all these loose marbles, but his chronicle of the Kardashian Kids carries unpleasant racial overtones to which he appears tone-deaf. He mentions Khloe’s marriage to “the 6-foot-10 black pro basketball player Lamar Odom,” cites Kim’s divorce from Damon Thomas, “the first of her three African-American husbands,” and later circles back to Khloe, who “apparently had a real thing about romancing giant-size African-American hoop stars” (my agog italics). Composing himself, Oppenheimer covers the controversy over the Kardashians’ appropriation of black culture and iconography, as epitomized by Kim’s bare-backsided cover shot for Paper magazine (the one that “broke the internet”), but by then it’s too late in the book to be affecting a furrowed brow and going all Charlie Rose on us.

In the epilogue, Oppenheimer notes that all is not ducky in Kardashiana. The ratings for “Keeping Up” (now in its 14th season) are eroding and Kardashian mugs on the covers of slick magazines have become newsstand underperformers. During Fashion Week in 2016 Kim was robbed of $11 million-worth of jewelry by masked gunmen who broke into her Paris hotel suite and left her gagged — a crime that aroused suspicion that it was all a publicity stunt (it wasn’t, according to follow-up reports) and a hardy chorus of schadenfreude across social media. Oppenheimer floats the scenario that the wily Kris has one last shazam! act to pull: a daredevil leap for the biggest prize of all, the presidency. Citing Trump’s 2016 victory, he draws the obvious, dreary parallels between their reality-TV roots and social media reach, and explains that Kris and her family “have a big following among young African-American men, a bloc that eluded Trump, and have huge support among millennial women 18 to 34, and support in the transgender community — especially if Caitlyn, a staunch Republican, plays ball and stumps for her ex-wife if she, indeed, runs for elective office as she’s suggested.”

Please, stop. First Ivanka’s name is floated, now Kris’s, as if the most powerful office in the shrinking free world is a glorious bauble awarded after long devotion to celebrity, self-enrichment and the family brand, public service be damned. Why keep feeding their ravenous egos? Shouldn’t their brazen success be enough for them? It’d be nice if the first woman president were someone who’d actually done some good.","In ‘Raising Trump’ and ‘The Kardashians,’ Two Portraits of Modern American Matriarchy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review/the-kardashians-jerry-oppenheimer-raising-trump-ivana-trump.html

While many Republicans in the House and the Senate have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to repeal the mandate, they have been wary of injecting the treacherous politics of health care into the debate over taxes.

In some cases Mr. Trump’s tweets on taxes have sowed confusion about the direction he wants to chart for the legislation.

The president said previously that he wanted Republican negotiators to allow for a higher individual tax bracket to make sure that the bill was sufficiently progressive. The House plan would keep a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires and the Senate plan has a top rate of 38.5 percent for high earners. But now Mr. Trump wants to lower the top rate while also giving deeper cuts to the middle class.

Although Mr. Trump must sign the eventual legislation, Republican lawmakers have shown a willingness to break with his wishes. Mr. Trump originally called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, but Senate Republicans appear to have settled on a 20 percent rate that will be delayed by a year. Senate Republicans also have ignored Mr. Trump’s desire to fully eliminate the estate tax and, for now, they have not addressed the special treatment of “carried interest” that gives hedge fund managers and private equity partners lower tax rates on their income.

Mr. Trump’s latest suggestions come as the Senate Finance Committee is due on Monday to begin debating the bill and considering amendments, a process that should continue all week.

Most of the region’s fishermen, who have been out of work since the ban, poach totoaba swim bladders, which fetch $3,000 to $10,000 per kilogram, said Andrea Crosta, the director of a group that investigates the totoaba trade. An equivalent catch of shrimp might earn a fisherman $200 at best.

“If you’re out here on the water, you’re not risking jail time to catch shrimp,” said Dave Bader, a spokesman for Vaquita CPR.

After the death of the captured vaquita, the scientists agreed to shut down the program. “The evidence today is vaquita are not good candidates for being protected in this way,” Dr. Smith said. “It’s heartbreaking.”

The scientists had hoped to keep the animals in captivity temporarily, and possibly even breed them, until gill nets were eliminated from their habitat. While any wild animal is expected to experience some stress when captured, the group had hoped the vaquita could cope with being handled. (Last month, the scientists released a vaquita calf they had pulled from the waters when they determined it was too young to be separated from its mother.)

Other conservationists had been critical of the plan. “I was telling them that this was going to happen, you’re going to stress out the animals,” said Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd conservation group, which also works to protect vaquitas. “They are very elusive, they are very shy; you’re going to kill one of them.”

Mr. Crosta said that while he admired the work of the biologists, they couldn’t possibly solve a problem “that starts in San Felipe and ends in a shop in China.” The fate of the vaquita, he said, was “entirely in the hands of law enforcement.”

In the past two years, Sea Shepherd and local groups have recovered more than 25,000 yards of gill nets from the gulf, weighing about 50 tons. Now that efforts to capture the vaquitas have failed, conservationists say hauling in the poachers’ nets is the best bet to save the species from extinction.

The Mexican government, conservationists say, also needs to crack down on illegal fishing, while providing sustainable alternatives for the community. Financial compensation from the government often never makes it into the hands of the fishermen, diverted by corruption, Mr. Crosta said.

There’s no magic formula for getting into a selective college, but over a decade covering admissions for The Chronicle of Higher Education, I’ve picked up a thing or two. These takeaways, based on hundreds of interviews with admissions deans over the years, may help you navigate the process.

Admissions decisions aren’t all about you.

When colleges choose applicants, they’re juggling competing goals, like increasing diversity and bringing in more revenue. Admissions officers aren’t looking for students who fit just one description — say, those who’ve earned all A’s or won the most awards. So don’t take rejection personally.

Grades and test scores still carry the most weight.

Colleges often say they want to get to know the real you, but that’s probably true only if your academic accomplishments (and the rigor of courses you’ve taken) pass muster.

You’re more than a number.

After colleges identify a big batch of students with outstanding credentials, differences among them become more important, admissions deans say. Among some of the attributes they tell me they would like to see evidence of (in essays, extracurricular activities, recommendations) are: leadership, risk taking, emotional intelligence, fire for learning, critical thinking, curiosity, empathy, optimism, grit, perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles.

Express your authentic self.

Overwhelmed by slick, boastful essays, colleges are eager for what they call “authentic” glimpses of applicants — their experiences, passions and goals. Some deans believe they’ll get deeper insight through alternative formats like videos, pictures, audio files or documents (an Advanced Placement English paper, maybe). A handful of prestigious schools, including Yale, the University of Chicago, Pomona College, Reed College and the University of Rochester, recently introduced this option. As with essays, too much polish is no good, deans say, so you might think twice about hiring a professional videographer. At Yale, about 400 applicants (out of nearly 33,000) for this year’s freshman class sent in something in an alternative format. In at least one case, the submission — a video showing leadership and impact on others — was, the dean told me, a “difference maker.”",10 Things to Know About Getting Into Your Dream College,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/education/edlife/admissions-tips-on-getting-into-dream-college.html

A. Before you crunch numbers, decide if you want to be a landlord. Are you prepared to take a call at 3 a.m. when the heat fails during a blizzard in January? If the dishwasher won’t work properly, you will be expected to fix the problem immediately. If the rent is late (or does not arrive) you will have to chase the tenant for the money, and maybe even take the case to housing court.

“Being a landlord isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants in Manhattan.

Generally, renters do not maintain homes the way owners do. Consider the finicky dishwasher: If you own the house and the dishwasher is on its last legs, you might hold out until you can afford a new stainless steel model that matches the newer refrigerator. But a tenant will expect a functioning dishwasher pronto, and so, chances are, you will swap out the aging one with a cheap white model.

“I’ve had people who’ve rented their homes and they come back and it’s never the house they left,” said Allison Maguire, a sales associate for Halstead in Montclair, N.J. “No one takes care of a rental as if it’s their true home.”

To make your decision, research the rental market, as its fluctuations are not necessarily tied to the sales market. With the help of a broker, estimate how much rent you could fetch: Would it be enough to cover the mortgage and taxes? Consider other expenses, too, like landscaping services, and insurance. Ask your accountant about tax implications. Factor in vacancies and repairs. You may need to hire a property manager if, for example, you move out of the area.

Tally your estimated profit for the number of years you anticipate renting out the house. Then compare that figure with the cash you would walk away with should you sell your house today. Is the potential payoff worth the headache of being a landlord? It might be. But being a landlord is a job, and you have to decide if it is one you want.

This kind of turn-the-other-cheek diplomacy depends on American submission and an eventual Russian awakening to the moral failing of their assault, neither of which is going to happen. It depends on Putin having a heart and a guiding sense of morality, both of which are in question.

John McCain rightly issued a blistering rebuke of Trump, writing in a statement:

“There’s nothing ‘America First’ about taking the word of a K.G.B. colonel over that of the American intelligence community. There’s no ‘principled realism’ in cooperating with Russia to prop up the murderous Assad regime, which remains the greatest obstacle to a political solution that would bring an end to the bloodshed in Syria. Vladimir Putin does not have America’s interests at heart. To believe otherwise is not only naïve but also places our national security at risk.”

The truth here is that we are seeing in real time how the president’s personal paranoia impedes our national policy and our national interests. The uncomfortable fact here is that Trump is pursuing his own interest, not American interests. And, on the question of Russia attacking our elections, Trump and Putin’s interest align against the facts and against America.

That alone is beyond inexcusable. Trump is betraying this country by trying to curry favor with his new comrade.

They both have an interest in casting doubt on whether Russia attacked our elections. Putin wants to be seen as innocent and Trump wants to be seen as legitimate, and neither is completely true.

Let’s say this again, as a clear declaration: Russia attacked our elections. They stole emails that were published and broadcast ad nauseam. They created and distributed propaganda on social media designed to exacerbate our divisions, content that was seen by nearly half the country.

We may never know precisely how all the Russian efforts influenced our elections — which of these might have influenced the vote of individuals or conversely turned other voters off of the process altogether so that they just stayed home — but saying that it had no effect defies logic and is indeed laughable.

We don’t know if the Russian election meddling was dispositive, but we know that it was disruptive.

Clapper and Brennan shot back at Trump on CNN on Sunday morning, claiming that the president was being played. Clapper said: “The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country.”

On Sunday, Trump tried, pathetically, to take back the slap in the face he had delivered to this country and its intelligence agencies, saying of Putin: “I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership.”

Again, like Neo dodging bullets in “The Matrix,” Trump bends over backward to dodge making this simple, factual statement: Russia attacked our elections when he was elected, and they must pay for their crime so that this never happens again.

Trump won’t acknowledge the crime because Trump was the beneficiary of the crime. Trump won’t insult Russia because it may well be that he was installed by Russia. Trump is as much a Russian project as an American president.

This means that he is compromised, in capacity and function, and that means that Trump’s fear of dishonor places the rest of us in danger of future attacks and exploitation. Trump is Putin’s dupe. ☐",Siding With the Enemy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/trump-putin-russia.html

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

This relationship held even when he excluded the United States, indicating that it could not be explained by some other factor particular to his home country. And it held when he controlled for homicide rates, suggesting that mass shootings were better explained by a society’s access to guns than by its baseline level of violence.

Factors That Don’t Correlate

If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States, the number of mental health professionals per capita and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.

A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues. And Mr. Lankford, in an email, said countries with high suicide rates tended to have low rates of mass shootings — the opposite of what you would expect if mental health problems correlated with mass shootings.

Whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact. Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country.

Racial diversity or other factors associated with social cohesion also show little correlation with gun deaths. Among European countries, there is little association between immigration or other diversity metrics and the rates of gun murders or mass shootings.

A Violent Country

America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. In Canada and Britain, it was 5 per million and 0.7 per million, respectively, which also corresponds with differences in gun ownership.

Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime, a notion ingrained, in part, by a series of films portraying urban gang violence in the early 1990s. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries, according to a landmark 1999 study by Franklin E. Zimring and Gordon Hawkins of the University of California, Berkeley.

Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.

They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.

More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across virtually every axis: among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities and when controlling for crime rates. And gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders, according to a recent analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries.

This suggests that the guns themselves cause the violence.

Comparisons in Other Societies

Skeptics of gun control sometimes point to a 2016 study. From 2000 and 2014, it found, the United States death rate by mass shooting was 1.5 per one million people. The rate was 1.7 in Switzerland and 3.4 in Finland, suggesting American mass shootings were not actually so common.

But the same study found that the United States had 133 mass shootings. Finland had only two, which killed 18 people, and Switzerland had one, which killed 14. In short, isolated incidents. So while mass shootings can happen anywhere, they are only a matter of routine in the United States.

As with any crime, the underlying risk is impossible to fully erase. Any individual can snap or become entranced by a violent ideology. What is different is the likelihood that this will lead to mass murder.

In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.

By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.

Beyond the Statistics

In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America’s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths.

This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America’s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan’s. That gap between 150 and 300 shows that gun ownership statistics alone do not explain what makes America different.

The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.

Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States.

Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.

The Difference Is Culture

The United States is one of only three countries, along with Mexico and Guatemala, that begin with the opposite assumption: that people have an inherent right to own guns.

The main reason American regulation of gun ownership is so weak may be the fact that the trade-offs are simply given a different weight in the United States than they are anywhere else.

After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.

That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.

“In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,” Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. “Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.”",What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.

Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.

There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck’s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.

At one point the computer’s “vision” briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn’t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.

“Sometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I’m used to the truck driving,” Mr. Runions said.

Starsky’s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions’s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky’s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.

Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.

“One driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,” Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.

The March of Automation

Starsky’s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea — having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments — is something of an industry consensus.

“One of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,” said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber’s self-driving truck unit.

As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark’s autonomous trucks.

From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux’s California warehouses.

“It’s a mirror of what we would do if there weren’t a driver inside,” said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.

A few miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.

Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton’s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.

Josh Switkes, the company’s chief executive, said that because Peloton’s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.

“Our basic approach is let’s bring real value to the fleet and society now,” Mr. Switkes said.",Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/self-driving-trucks.html

The biannual fashion weeks hosted in New York, London, Milan and Paris have dominated the industry calendar for decades. In recent years, however, a clutch of new contenders have emerged, including Dubai, where Arab Fashion Week begins tomorrow.

The five-day event is a predictably glitzy affair, showcasing talent from the 22 countries that make up the Arab League. Plenty of emerging Western designers are also on the schedule, keen to cater to the valuable Middle Eastern client base. Above, Saudi designer Sadeem Alshehail, background, after her fashion show in Dubai last month.

Expect a broad mix of both Western-style ready-to-wear and modest clothing from the catwalk collections. As a growing global chorus of women demands attire that is in tune both with Islam and the societies around them, designers are responding with flowing printed tunics and colorful head scarves. Interestingly, designers from abroad are often the more conservative.

Modest fashion is becoming a commercial phenomenon. The global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $368 billion by 2021, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report. With its blend of trends from all over the world, Arab Fashion Week is playing a considerable role in reshaping perceptions of 21st-century Muslim female identity in ways that go far beyond the veil.

The initial reports to Sergeant Melgar’s superiors in Germany said he had been injured while wrestling with the two Navy commandos, according to three officials who have been briefed on the investigation and who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service took over the case in late September from Army criminal authorities after the status of the two Navy commandos was changed from “witnesses” to “persons of interest,” meaning officials were trying to determine what the commandos knew about the death and whether they were involved.

The Navy SEALs’ potential role threatens to tarnish SEAL Team 6, the famed counterterrorism unit that carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Until now, the biggest unanswered question in the case has been why Sergeant Melgar was killed. But new clues are emerging on that front.

An American service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said he was under the impression that the sergeant had stumbled on some sort of money-skimming scheme involving the Navy commandos. A retired senior enlisted sailor who served in SEAL Team 6 said Sergeant Melgar discovered the scam and threatened to report the Navy commandos to the authorities. Sergeant Melgar’s suspicions were first reported in the Daily Beast.

Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the sergeant’s death remains under investigation. A spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Ed Buice, declined to comment on the homicide investigation.

Special Operations troops from a range of units can earn qualifications that let them recruit sources for intelligence and pay them. These individuals may handle payments from small cash bags up to storage lockers filled with currency.

Cash from funds to pay informants has a way of going missing, military officials said. Skimming money from funds, which in Mali could be as much as $20,000 at any given time, is relatively easy because the service members are often dealing with sources who are illiterate and cannot sign their names to a receipt. This allows an unscrupulous person to create a bogus receipt with the equivalent of an “X” for a signature, military officials said.

One of the first missions to draw broad public attention to the secretive Navy SEAL Team 6 unit was its dramatic rescue in April 2009 of Capt. Richard Phillips after Somali pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama cargo ship. Snipers from the unit’s Red Squadron shot and killed three of the pirates in a small rescue boat.

The criminal complaint against the surviving pirate, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, describes how Captain Phillips gave roughly $30,000 in cash from the safe aboard the Maersk to the pirates, money that soon disappeared. Captain Phillips later recalled leaning against a sack with the money inside on the lifeboat. When Navy personnel searched the lifeboat, all they found were guns, ammunition, cellphones and radios. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service gave the SEALs polygraph tests about the missing money but could never prove where the $30,000 had gone, and the case was closed. No SEAL from that mission is involved in the Mali case.

Much is unknown about what happened around 5 a.m. June 4 in the house that Sergeant Melgar shared with another Army Green Beret and the two Navy commandos.

The SEALs were in the country on a clandestine mission to support French and Malian counterterrorism forces battling Al Qaeda’s branch in North and West Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as smaller cells aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The Americans helped provide intelligence for missions, and had participated in at least two such operations in Mali this year before Sergeant Melgar’s death. Over all, about two dozen American troops operate in Mali at any given time, mostly to help on training and counterterrorism missions.

SEAL Team 6, formally known as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, has over the past decade carried out kill-or-capture missions in Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, as well as the one that killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.

According to one version of events surrounding the death in Mali, from a military official, one of the SEALs put Sergeant Melgar in a chokehold. When the sergeant passed out, the commandos frantically tried to revive him. Failing that, they rushed him to an emergency clinic, where he was pronounced dead.

The service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said that the sergeant’s chain of command immediately grew suspicious when the initial incident reports said the death was the result of a drunken accident. His friends and superiors knew Sergeant Melgar did not drink.

One of the SEAL commandos under investigation is Petty Officer Tony E. DeDolph, a former professional mixed martial arts fighter, according to two military officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. His identity was reported by The Intercept.

Petty Officer DeDolph and the second Navy commando, who has not been identified, were flown out of Mali shortly after Sergeant Melgar’s death and were placed on administrative leave at the unit’s headquarters in Dam Neck, Va.

Sergeant Melgar, a graduate of Texas Tech University who joined the Army in 2012, was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., the same unit whose soldiers were attacked by a much larger and heavily armed group of Islamic State fighters near the border between Niger and Mali on Oct. 4.

Sergeant Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Tex., was about four months into what military officials said was a six-month tour in Mali. He was part of a small crisis-response team in Bamako assigned to help provide intelligence about Islamic militants in Mali to the United States Embassy to help protect its personnel against attacks. The sergeant also helped assess which Malian Army troops might be trained and equipped to build a counterterrorism force.

I knew that he was the District attorney in Elowah County. I did not understand what that meant, but I knew that he was an important person and I always treated him with respect.

When he was at the restaurant he would speak to me and would sometimes pull the ends of my long hair as I walked by him. I had red hair down to my waist. He would complement me on my looks. I did not think anything of it. I did nothing to encourage his flirtatious behavior. I was accustomed to men flirting with me because I was well developed and I competed in beauty pageants. I did not attach any significance to Mr. Moore’s behavior towards me and I did not respond to any of Mr. Moore’s flirtatious behavior for two reasons: First, I had a boyfriend. Second, even if I had not had a boyfriend I was not interested in having a dating or sexual relationship with a man twice my age.

I turned 16 on November 14, 1977. About a month later I received my yearbook from Southside high school where I had spent my freshman and sophomore years. I happened to bring my yearbook to work with me to the restaurant on December 22, 1977. I put it down at the end of the counter. Mr. Moore happened to notice it and asked if he could write in your yearbook. I felt flattered and I said “yes”. He wrote in my yearbook as follows:

I took the yearbook home with me at the end of my shift that day. I felt honored that Mr. Moore, who was such an important person, would write in my yearbook.

A week or two later I was working at the restaurant. My shift ended at 10pm when the restaurant closed. It was a cold night and I went outside to wait for my boyfriend to pick me up and drive me home. My boyfriend was late. Mr. Moore exited the restaurant at the same time as I did. He noticed that my boyfriend was not there and he offered me a ride home.

I trusted Mr. Moore. He was the District attorney. I thought that he was simply doing something nice by offering to drive me home. I did not want to wait outside in the cold so I agreed.

I wanted to call my boyfriend but this was before cell phones and I had no way to contact him. My home was only about two and a half miles away. I planned to call my boyfriend after I got home to let him know that I had gotten a ride home and that there was no need for him to pick me up.

Mr. Moore was wearing brown hush puppies on his feet. He drove a two door car. I believe that it was an old car, but I do not recall the model. I got into his car in the passenger seat. He began driving. I thought he would get on the highway, but instead he drove to the back of the restaurant. I was not immediately alarmed as there was an exit from the back of the restaurant to the street and he could drive from there to my house without getting on the highway. However, instead of driving to the street he stopped the car and parked his car in between the dumpster and the back of the restaurant where there were no lights. The area was dark and deserted. I was alarmed and I immediately asked him what he was doing.

Instead of answering my question, Mr. Moore reached over and began groping me, putting his hands on my breasts. I tried to open my car door to leave, but he reached over and locked it so I could not get out. I tried fighting him off, while yelling at him to stop, but instead of stopping he began squeezing my neck attempting to force my head onto his crotch. I continued to struggle. I was determined that I was not allow him to force me to have sex with him. I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought that he was going to rape me. I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop. I had tears running down my face.

At some point he gave up. He then looked at me and said, “you are a child. I am the District attorney of Etiwah County. If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you.” He finally allowed me to open the car door and I either fell out or he pushed me out. I was on the ground as he pulled out of the parking area behind the restaurant. The passenger door was still open as he burned rubber pulling away leaving me lying there on the cold concrete in the dark.

I got up and tried to pull myself together. I was making my way to the front of the restaurant when my boyfriend arrived. It was late and it was dark. I did not say anything to him as to what had occurred as he had a violent temper and I was afraid that he would do something that would get him into trouble. When I got home I went to my room. The following morning my neck was black and blue and purple. In the days following I covered the bruising on my neck with makeup. I did not tell anyone about what had happened. I was scared. I felt that if I told anyone Mr. Moore would do something to me or my family. I decided to keep what happened to myself.

The day after Mr. Moore assaulted me I called the restaurant and quit my job. I never went there again.

About two years later I told my younger sister what Mr. Moore did to me. About four years ago I told my mother what happened. Before I married my husband, John, I told him what Mr. Moore had done to me.

My husband and I supported Donald Trump for President. This has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats. It has everything to do with Mr. Moore’s sexual assault when I was a teenager.

I thought that I was Mr. Moore’s only victim. I would probably have taken what Mr. Moore did to me to my grave, had it not been for the courage of four other women that were willing to speak out about their experiences with Mr. Moore. Their courage has inspired me to overcome my fear.

Those two foods have snaked their way into the Australian restaurant zeitgeist like no other in recent years, as edible Americana has become ubiquitous here. But these two giants of Southern cookery are also culinary emissaries of Korean culture. And as ambassadors go, you can’t get much more charming and irresistible than sizzling meats and crispy chicken served with plenty of beer.

There is so much more to Korean food, however, than these greasy darlings, and there are very few places in Melbourne to explore that vast deliciousness. You can get a decent bibimbap here and there, and kimchi shows up on cafe menus almost as often as dukkah these days. Much harder to find are bubbling caldrons of jjigae, turned blazing scarlet from kimchi and chiles, dotted with pork and bulbous clouds of soon tofu.

In my book, these stews are some of life’s most elemental and necessary dishes.

Not until I found Joomak.

It was no easy feat: Joomak, opened in 2010, is in the basement of a personality-less Swanston Street office building in Melbourne’s Central Business District, with no street signage indicating that you are in the right location. You enter the building feeling wholly unsure of yourself before descending a flight of stairs that lead to a heavy wooden door. Though the name of the restaurant is above the staircase, and a note on the basement door explains that the business is cash-only, it is not until you step into the room that you are entirely sure you have found the place. It does not help that both map apps on my phone put Joomak down a nearby alley, where I encountered other bewildered would-be customers searching for an entrance between Dumpsters.

That won’t work this time.

This kind of turn-the-other-cheek diplomacy depends on American submission and an eventual Russian awakening to the moral failing of their assault, neither of which is going to happen. It depends on Putin having a heart and a guiding sense of morality, both of which are in question.

John McCain rightly issued a blistering rebuke of Trump, writing in a statement:

“There’s nothing ‘America First’ about taking the word of a K.G.B. colonel over that of the American intelligence community. There’s no ‘principled realism’ in cooperating with Russia to prop up the murderous Assad regime, which remains the greatest obstacle to a political solution that would bring an end to the bloodshed in Syria. Vladimir Putin does not have America’s interests at heart. To believe otherwise is not only naïve but also places our national security at risk.”

The truth here is that we are seeing in real time how the president’s personal paranoia impedes our national policy and our national interests. The uncomfortable fact here is that Trump is pursuing his own interest, not American interests. And, on the question of Russia attacking our elections, Trump and Putin’s interest align against the facts and against America.

That alone is beyond inexcusable. Trump is betraying this country by trying to curry favor with his new comrade.

They both have an interest in casting doubt on whether Russia attacked our elections. Putin wants to be seen as innocent and Trump wants to be seen as legitimate, and neither is completely true.

Let’s say this again, as a clear declaration: Russia attacked our elections. They stole emails that were published and broadcast ad nauseam. They created and distributed propaganda on social media designed to exacerbate our divisions, content that was seen by nearly half the country.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

We may never know precisely how all the Russian efforts influenced our elections — which of these might have influenced the vote of individuals or conversely turned other voters off of the process altogether so that they just stayed home — but saying that it had no effect defies logic and is indeed laughable.

We don’t know if the Russian election meddling was dispositive, but we know that it was disruptive.

Clapper and Brennan shot back at Trump on CNN on Sunday morning, claiming that the president was being played. Clapper said: “The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country.”

On Sunday, Trump tried, pathetically, to take back the slap in the face he had delivered to this country and its intelligence agencies, saying of Putin: “I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I am with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership.”

Again, like Neo dodging bullets in “The Matrix,” Trump bends over backward to dodge making this simple, factual statement: Russia attacked our elections when he was elected, and they must pay for their crime so that this never happens again.

Trump won’t acknowledge the crime because Trump was the beneficiary of the crime. Trump won’t insult Russia because it may well be that he was installed by Russia. Trump is as much a Russian project as an American president.

This means that he is compromised, in capacity and function, and that means that Trump’s fear of dishonor places the rest of us in danger of future attacks and exploitation.

Can You Draw the Starbucks Logo Without Cheating? Probably Not. Image The Apple logo hanging on the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. In a recent consumer study, people had a difficult time recreating even some of the corporate world’s simplest and most ubiquitous logos. Credit Andrew Burton/Getty Images

The Apple logo was green. The symbol for Foot Locker was a sneaker. And Starbucks? The famous siren on every frappuccino and chai latte was not exactly the friendliest-looking sea dweller.

When 156 people were recently asked if they could draw some of the world’s most iconic brand logos from memory, some of their recreations were laughably off the mark. But something wasn’t so funny for the companies that have tried to sear their brands into the minds of consumers everywhere: For 10 iconic brands including Wal-Mart, Burger King, and Ikea, the overall percentage of near-perfect drawings was just 16 percent.

That means fewer than one-fifth of the participants could remember the correct positioning of the familiar blue-and-red rectangle of Domino’s, or the three black stripes of Adidas. Even Target — whose emblem involves a simple red bull’s-eye above the brand name — confused people: 41 percent forgot the number of circles.

“People spend so much on marketing to get people to recognize and remember their brand,” said Nelson James, co-founder and chief operating officer of the e-commerce site Signs.com, which led the study. “We just wanted to know — does it work?”

The answer is that being able to recognize a logo and being able to recreate it appear to be vastly different things. Although participants thought they had a good grasp on the designs, expressing confidence that they could redraw them without seeing them, their actual reproductions proved otherwise.

Logos are what companies use to help customers identify the brand, and choices like design, color and font are “critical,” Mr. James said. “Having these logos where you can’t correctly recall details means something.”

In an age of digital saturation, perhaps many of these carefully constructed logos are not as memorable as we think. A study conducted in 2014 by psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles similarly asked 85 participants if they could draw the familiar Apple logo from memory. More than half the subjects even identified themselves as strictly Apple users. Yet only one could draw the icon perfectly, as scored by a 14-point rubric.

Should Apple be worried? Not necessarily. Dr. Alan Castel, a psychology professor who was one of the authors of the study, said that the inability to accurately recall such daily ephemera as a brand logo really might be a beneficial quirk of our memory system.

“We don’t burden our memory with things we don’t need to know,” Dr. Castel said. He referred to a famous study in 1979 by the psychologists Raymond Nickerson and Marilyn Jager Adams, in which participants were asked to draw the face of a penny. Most struggled.

“It’s rare that you really need to recall something from memory,” Dr. Castel said. “You simply recognize it, you see it on an item or a computer. You like it, you buy it.”

Still, in recent years, brands like Uber, YouTube, and Dropbox have redesigned their logos, trying to make them more simple, more intuitive or more easily recognizable. In 2014, Airbnb announced its new logo, which it calls the Bélo, in a video that noted that the design was easy for customers to draw.

Image Airbnb redesigned its logo to be easy to draw, in hopes that customers would use it in their own homes. Credit Matthew Millman for The New York Times

Paul Stafford, co-founder of DesignStudio, the agency that led the rebranding effort, said that Airbnb envisioned people renting out their homes and putting their own spin on the Bélo — on everything from magazines to bathrobes and shampoo bottles, like a hotel.

“We had to create something that was so simple that everybody could draw it and interpret it themselves,” Mr. Stafford said. “They also wanted people to be sharing it. Right down to the people tattooing the mark on their arms.”

Mr. Stafford, however, said that he did not think that being able to draw a logo necessarily indicates how well it resonates.

People often see logos so much that they feel like they know it. But they rarely critique it or study it enough to reproduce fine details — a phenomenon that psychologists like Dr. Castel call “inattentional amnesia.” When something is seen frequently, the information ends up being more easily ignored or forgotten. For instance, Dr. Castel said he would be curious how accurately people could recall the fine details of a stop sign.

“We know it’s red, but the more subtle features — the exact shape of it, whether there’s a white border around it — these are things we often miss, even though we’ve seen it millions of times,” he said.

Perhaps the most surprising result of the Signs.com study was the company that fared best: Ikea. The Swedish furniture maker with the distinctive blue-and-yellow logo plastered across its giant retail stores was redrawn near-perfectly by 30 percent of the participants.

Asa Nordin, who is a senior coordinator of Ikea trademarks at Inter Ikea Systems, said the unique shape, colors, and longevity of the logo — it has been around since 1983 — most likely contributed to its memorability.

“The logo is merely the symbol for what the Ikea brand promises and delivers,” Ms. Nordin said in an email. “The logo shall mirror that ‘promise’ as near as possible, as well as stand out from its surroundings. To be consistent and unique is clearly a strength of a logo.”

The hardest logo to draw was Starbucks, which was redesigned in 2011. It is also arguably the most complex.

“Simplicity is key,” Mr. James said. “That’s not necessarily a new concept. But this definitely corroborates that idea.”

But is any logo overwhelmingly memorable? Mr. James is now curious. Initially, he resisted putting an overly straightforward and ubiquitous symbol in his study, like those of McDonald’s or Nike.

“We thought it was too simple,” Mr. James said. “But, I wonder.”

This wish was at once selfless and self-protecting: Beau couldn’t bear the thought of his illness derailing his father’s political aspirations. Biden understood this. He went with it. The whole family did. Dreaming of 2016, he writes, sometimes became a kind of performance, a family diversion: “It was as if we were all keeping up an elaborate and needful charade.”

This charade also happened to suit Biden. Entertaining a presidential bid during those dark days gave him meaning, “a way to defy the fates.” And part of him obviously wanted to run.

Biden’s life was full of surreal juxtapositions during Beau’s illness. One minute, he was sitting at his son’s bedside in the hospital; the next, he was in a specially designated room nearby, talking to the prime minister of Iraq. The work focused him, allowing him to contain his feelings. But those feelings would heave to the surface in private. On March 29, 2015, as Air Force Two was taking off, he wrote in his diary that he felt buoyed and hopeful. A few hours later, he added three staccato sentences. Just landed. 6:07. I feel so goddam lonely.

These flashes of vulnerability are part of what makes “Promise Me, Dad” memorable; so, too, are the small, tender interactions between Biden and his dying son. “Guess who was at the office today?” Biden asked Beau one night. Elton John. “You remember when I used to drive you and Hunt to school? That song we would all sing together, the three of us, as loud as we could?” Beau couldn’t answer by then; he was no longer capable of speech. But he smiled. So Biden sang as much of “Crocodile Rock” as he could remember.

Soon after he was first elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden’s wife, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. He has a great, unwanted body of expertise in coping with loss. “Promise Me, Dad” shows that he’s willing to make use of it. Imparting what he knows about bereavement is part of his legacy now.

He gives his philosophy of the eulogy. He shares tricks he’s learned about how to bear up and survive the earliest days of mourning. When he speaks at funerals and memorials, he writes, he often gives his private phone number to the grieving. “When you’re down and you feel guilty for burdening your family and friends,” he tells them, “pick up the phone and call.” Some do.

It’s to Biden’s credit that you don’t really question these anecdotes. He may be a bit excitable, a bit of a windbag. But anyone who’s ever covered Congress (I did, for a while) can discern on the page what was discernible in real life: the bartender aspect of Biden’s character, the natural convener who reads customers well enough to put them at ease. He’s always understood that the political is personal.

Which leads to the inevitable question: Is “Promise Me, Dad” secretly a campaign book?

The way he repeatedly recounts his accomplishments and expertise certainly suggests he’s thinking about a 2020 run, as does the way he finds multiple excuses to invoke his middle-class bona fides. His advisers, he pointedly tells us, concluded in 2015 that his reputation as a “gaffe machine” was no longer a liability. “Authenticity matters,” one of them wrote.

The suggestion being that he’s Trump minus the Trump.

For Biden, the heart of 2015 contained a paradox. He faced tremendous pressure inside his own home to run for president, for Beau’s sake. But outside his home, the pressure for him to run didn’t reach its peak until after Beau died, the very moment he was least able to handle the strains of a national campaign. Yet that was when many of his former colleagues from the Senate urged him to jump in. That was when George Clooney got in touch and offered to raise money.

And then Hillary Clinton lost — in many of the states where Biden appeared to poll well.

It must have been a powerful formula for regret. Even if, as Barack Obama suspected, Clinton had the nomination sewn up. Obama had discouraged Biden from making the leap from the start.

So Biden ends his book outlining the agenda for the 2016 presidential campaign he never ran. It’s an unrealized story, vibrantly alive on the page but not in the world. Just like Beau. It’s all tied up with Beau.","In Joe Biden’s Memoir, Private Grief and Its Effect on a Public Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review-joe-biden-promise-me-dad-memoir.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.
The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said.
Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq.
“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

Photo

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

Media reporters and male competitors routinely trivialize her accomplishments. Never once during her tenure does she work up the nerve to ask for a proper raise, even after Vanity Fair becomes profitable and Harper’s Bazaar starts to court her. (She eventually enlists the help of a superagent.) Even she suffers from a self-esteem gap.

When Brown was first offered the job to rescue the recently revived (and incompetently revived) Vanity Fair, in 1983, she was just 29 years old. The magazine was an outpost of confusion in those days, and Condé Nast was a castle of paranoia, its towers filled with schemers hoping to avoid defenestration.

It took a while for Brown to master the politics of this byzantine kingdom, and it took a while for her to arrive at the formula that would ultimately be responsible for the magazine’s success: A mix of celebrity chronicles, foreign reportage, true-crime stories, profiles of power brokers and extravagant photo spreads — all sitting side by side in the back of the same limo.

If these diaries have a theme, it’s status anxiety. There was no finer moment than the ’80s to explore status anxiety. The book teems with gossip from that bygone era, with the Kissingers, Reagans and a thousand high-haired socialites in starring roles. (Along with our current president. “It feels, when you have finished it, as if you’ve been nose to nose for four hours with an entertaining con man, and I suspect the American public will like nothing better,” Brown writes in 1987, having just decided to excerpt “The Art of the Deal.”)

There’s swing in Brown’s voice and vinegar in her pen. Walter Mondale is “a decent, intelligent, slightly boring fellow who would make an excellent prime minister of Norway.” Michael Huffington, the ex-husband of Arianna, is “a tall glass of water with a weak smile.” Almost everything she shares about the Kissingers is perfect. The best, perhaps: when a friend cattily asks, “Have you noticed their dining room is an exact replica of the State Department’s?”

For legacy-media freaks, “The Vanity Fair Diaries” is a bound volume of crack. Tina Brown’s moment wasn’t just predicated on the excesses of Wall Street. It was predicated on the excesses of the magazine business, of a time when editors still had time and money to burn. A crisis in Brown’s world was being seated at the wrong table at the Four Seasons, or being forced to coordinate coverage of Andy Warhol’s death by speakerphone because the person best suited to do it was off in Gstaad.

Yet after reading these diaries, I still wonder how much of an audience exists for them. Pages upon pages are filled with stories about dinners with doyennes who, even in their day, were only a big deal in one or two ZIP codes. Many of its barons are long forgotten, dead or disgraced. The dish about Condé Nast’s kings and queens regnant will be tasty to those who know them, but will anyone beyond their own (dwindling) clan even care?

Tolstoy can ask you to remember hundreds of characters. I don’t think Tina Brown can.

Brown also never satisfactorily reconciles why she wanted to insert herself into the endless cocktail surf of the ’80s. She professes to be an introvert, and she repeatedly laments New York’s materialism, posturing and social churn. Yet she often writes these plaintive entries from her beach house in the Hamptons. “Why do I keep seeking out the very things I deride?” she asks.

Her reply — “perhaps because I was born to chronicle them” — suggests that large parts of her desires remain unexamined. She lived and celebrated these values as much as she chronicled them. “Vanity Fair’s fifth anniversary party!” she writes on March 1, 1988. “Maybe the best party in Manhattan since Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball.”

To me, Brown’s truest and most heartfelt confessions are about her maternal guilt and ambivalence. She’s beset by fears that her jet-engine work drive will never be compatible with a sane family life. “The weekend was hard, with G” — her toddler son, George — “being very difficult and Harry chained to his computer as bloody always,” she writes in 1989. “Two workaholics don’t make a rightaholic, particularly when it comes to raising kids.”

Knowing that her son has Asperger’s syndrome — Brown has written about it in recent years — makes certain entries especially painful. Gradually, we see her realize that her son is perseverating, mixing uneasily with other kids, missing crucial developmental milestones. Before he’s properly diagnosed, a neurologist chalks up his differences and delays to his premature birth. “Was it my fault for working too hard and long?” Brown asks herself. Your heart dissolves. It’s so hard to imagine a high-powered father asking himself this same question.

Brown may have been a complicated feminist figure. But she was also a trailblazer, willing to take risks and get battered and bruised in the arena. In 1992, she took over The New Yorker and had the temerity to transform it. She even dared to add photographs. I hope she also kept a diary during those years.

While many Republicans in the House and the Senate have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to repeal the mandate, they have been wary of injecting the treacherous politics of health care into the debate over taxes.

In some cases Mr. Trump’s tweets on taxes have sowed confusion about the direction he wants to chart for the legislation.

The president said previously that he wanted Republican negotiators to allow for a higher individual tax bracket to make sure that the bill was sufficiently progressive. The House plan would keep a top rate of 39.6 percent for millionaires and the Senate plan has a top rate of 38.5 percent for high earners. But now Mr. Trump wants to lower the top rate while also giving deeper cuts to the middle class.

Although Mr. Trump must sign the eventual legislation, Republican lawmakers have shown a willingness to break with his wishes. Mr. Trump originally called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate, but Senate Republicans appear to have settled on a 20 percent rate that will be delayed by a year. Senate Republicans also have ignored Mr. Trump’s desire to fully eliminate the estate tax and, for now, they have not addressed the special treatment of “carried interest” that gives hedge fund managers and private equity partners lower tax rates on their income.

Mr. Trump’s latest suggestions come as the Senate Finance Committee is due on Monday to begin debating the bill and considering amendments, a process that should continue all week.

The repeal of the individual mandate was not on the list of 355 amendments that the committee released on Sunday night.","Trump Again Wades Into Tax Debate, Suggesting Repeal of Obamacare Mandate",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/trump-taxes-obamacare-individual-mandate.html

Jones also has been accused of pushing the chief executive of Papa John’s, a pizza chain and a league sponsor, to discredit the commissioner and of leaking false information about the details of Goodell’s contract negotiations. Two weeks ago, John Schnatter, the Papa John’s chief executive, claimed that player protests during the national anthem had hurt his company’s sales.

Jones has denied that he is seeking revenge for Goodell’s decision to suspend Elliott for six games for violating the league’s personal conduct policy. Rather, Jones has said that he is trying to make Goodell’s contract talks more transparent in light of what he calls recent missteps by the league office, including how it has handled the protests by players.

Jones wants all owners to be able to sign off on the details of Goodell’s new contract, which would begin in 2019, even though the owners voted unanimously in May to allow the compensation committee to negotiate the specifics of the deal.

The six people on the committee – the owners of the Chiefs, Falcons, Giants, Patriots, Steelers and Texans – have spoken regularly with other owners about the status of the negotiations, and Blank briefed all owners on the contract talks at leaguewide meeting in mid-October.

The fight between Jones and the committee has raised the tension in other ways. Owners who would normally shake hands before their teams face off on game day are now avoiding Jones.

Suspending an owner for conduct detrimental to the league is an extraordinary step, but it has happened. Major League Baseball forced Marge Schott and George Steinbrenner to give up control of their clubs for periods of time. More recently, the N.B.A. forced Donald Sterling to sell the Los Angeles Clippers after he was heard making racist remarks on an audiotape.

The commissioner would have to impose the penalties, and is reluctant to do so without a groundswell of owners pushing him to take action, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.

Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated.
Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves.
This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr.","We know that love is dangerous, because it requires facing one’s own brokenness and vulnerability. Yet both of our nations are morally broken, imperfect. So we speak with the impassioned words of Mahatma Gandhi: “I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.”

This letter fervently asks more from you and from the United States. The writer James Baldwin, one of our most prophetic voices, wrote: “One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself — that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.” Neither of our nations has much to give the other because each has failed to risk itself. And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises. It serves as an intervention as we face the potential horrors of unspeakable mass death. We stand with our brother Martin Luther King Jr., who refused “to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.”

There are many here in the United States who will say that this letter is absurd, useless, even treasonous. Well, if love is treasonous, then we take joy in it. We revel in speaking out against hatred; inhumanity; divisiveness; discourse mired in immature name-calling; ugly, disparaging remarks; talk of destruction and obliteration; and the potential of miscalculation and nuclear conflagration. We prefer to stand on the “treasonous” side of Jesus, who dared to love.

We are traitors to those who reject mutual respect and who believe that there is no place for love as a binding force greater than mutual bullying and provocation. We are traitors to our country’s divisive rhetoric, filled with militarism, hatred, blood lust and warmongering, just as we stand opposed to yours, which threatens not only us, but also your neighbors — that is, your own brothers and sisters, and even your own people. As men of color, we know the semblance of that threat from within our own country.

To hate requires so little; to love requires doing what may feel impossible, because it means to lay down the sword and stretch out your hands, your arms, your hearts, to each other. Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated. Those people fail to imagine with their hearts. Dr. King said: “We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” And Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, another prophetic American voice of love, asked us, “How many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt.”

That kind of love refuses to hate, it refuses to believe that we are “enemies” by birth. We are brothers and sisters born of a common humanity. We believe in a love that remembers the humanity that binds us together, that opens us to hear the other’s voice, the other’s mourning. Then again, perhaps Baldwin was correct, “There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.” Yet we believe that reciprocal love can take us to that place together and heal our wounds.

David Kyuman Kim: These feel like especially loveless times. We write from the conviction that the values of a love-driven politics can transform how we engage each other not only as nations but also as human beings. Which is to say, a love-driven politics insists that we seek compassion, generosity, kindness, forgiveness and mercy for each other as much as we do for ourselves.

Our president was elected to represent our people, but he has not represented the best of us. He has instead chosen to display only our basest traits. While he is not the first president to speak and act with hubris and arrogance, he has chosen belligerence over diplomacy, bullying over accord, insult over care. He represents a strand and strain of the American experiment that stubbornly holds on to the misguided notion that we are a nation of destiny and superiority, strengthened on legacies of white supremacy and rapacious capitalism. He has exacted those misguided ideals by treating you with disrespect and disregard, all the while belittling you as a leader of your own people, and you, in turn have done the same.

As a Korean-American, I have to acknowledge you both as one of my people and very much not of my people. My mother’s family is from North Korea, and so in some very real ways, you and I are of common stock. But a land does not make for family. If anything, you and your father have shown how land and nation can destroy families and traumatize them for generations. You are the leader of a nation whose people have suffered at the service of a political vision. At what cost has your loyalty to power come to your people, let alone to your humanity?

My mother’s family fled North Korea because of the forces of war that are all too similar to the enmities that are threatening us today. And it was the consequences of the Korean War and the havoc it wreaked on my people in South Korea that eventually drove my family to the United States. And through this migration and growing up in white-supremacist America, I was transformed from our common stock to a Korean-American dedicated to the ways of love.

Indeed, as a Korean brother I have been forged by my inheritance from Christianity and Confucianism. This means that my witness to you is born of traditions of love and ethical responsibility. Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves. This is especially challenging at a moment in which love has been hard to find and discern. For those of us who lament the ascendancy of our current president, we have had to learn how to love ourselves once again.

We write you today not only because of what you are hearing from us — the United States — but, more important, because of all the crucial things you are not hearing. As defenders of civil rights against racism, we come from a tradition not well represented or well understood, yet one that has transformed the course of our nation’s history and the lives and legacies of peoples across the globe.

This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr. This is a tradition that insists that love has the power to bind us together in a common purpose, that love gives us the confidence and courage to stand up to injustice and suffering. It is a tradition that holds us accountable not simply to ourselves but to a vision of human existence that insists that we can be with one another, hold one another up, and fortify one another’s humanity in what Dr. King called “the beloved community.”

We reach out to you from this tradition that holds the value of speaking truth to power with love. This is a calling. It is our vocation. We have no choice but to strive to live up to the examples of Dr. King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, of activists like Fannie Lou Hamer and Grace Lee Boggs. These heroic figures have been exceptions to the insidious rule of an American legacy of white supremacy and imperialism that has left the least among us in utter despair. This tradition of radical love is an American tradition, even though it has drawn deeply and powerfully from people like Gandhi and Thich Nhat Hanh.

We come to you as citizens of an America not yet fully realized, one that insists that the ways of love can be the ways of democracy, that the challenge of loving one’s neighbors and enemies is fundamentally a call for freedom and justice and hope. We write to you with love and an appeal for forgiveness and mercy because history and our lot demand this of us. And our hope is that it will demand the same of our fellow citizens.

Wishing you peace and love,

Though only 39 percent of plans had very narrow networks of primary care physicians — covering less than 10 percent of those in their markets — 57 percent of plans had very narrow networks of psychiatrists.
And parents might have no idea until a child is ill.“A beneficiary needing more specialized care may only then discover the less attractive features of their health plan,” Mr. Polsky said.
And these resources can’t overcome another challenge some people face — a lack of access to broad network plans.
Insurers that wish to offer narrow network plans could be required to also offer broad network ones.","That confusion is understandable. A study of 2016 marketplace offerings in 13 states found that only two provided indications of network size. Eight of them, as well as HealthCare.gov, provided a way to look up whether a doctor was in a plan’s network, but only two could filter plans to show only those with providers a consumer selects.

“To our surprise, we also found that few marketplaces could indicate which hospitals were in plans’ networks,” said Charlene Wong, a pediatrician and researcher at the Margolis Center for Health Policy at Duke University and lead author of the study. “In addition, none of these tools indicated network breadth by specialty.” This means that a “broad” network plan might actually be quite narrow for some specialists, without consumers knowing.

A crop of new studies shows some of the specialties for which networks are likelier to be narrow, and suggests that what consumers don’t know might hurt them. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that plans with more narrow networks systematically excluded oncologists affiliated with higher-quality cancer centers. In part, this is how the plans offer lower premiums, because higher-quality cancer centers may demand higher payments. But it’s pretty likely consumers don’t know that they may be trading quality for price.

“Unless you already have cancer, it’s pretty unlikely you’ll check the quality of oncologists covered by health plans when making an enrollment decision,” said Daniel Polsky, a health economist with the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the study.

Another study by Mr. Polsky and colleagues, published in Health Affairs, found that many marketplace plans offer relatively few choices of mental health care professionals. Even plans with wide primary care networks can have narrow mental health ones, the study found. Though only 39 percent of plans had very narrow networks of primary care physicians — covering less than 10 percent of those in their markets — 57 percent of plans had very narrow networks of psychiatrists.

Marketplace plans also tend to be narrower for pediatric specialists than for adult specialists, according to other work by Dr. Wong and Mr. Polsky. And parents might have no idea until a child is ill.

“A beneficiary needing more specialized care may only then discover the less attractive features of their health plan,” Mr. Polsky said. “The priority should be improved provider network transparency at the time a plan is purchased.”

Scrutinizing the extent and quality of a plan is daunting. To find out which doctors are covered by a plan, you could consult its provider directory. But such directories are known to be error prone — listing physicians not in networks or failing to list those who are. Ideally, marketplaces would provide a sense of the breadth of a plan’s network. The marketplaces could directly provide metrics for how many doctors are covered, by specialty and by reasonable distance from your house, for example. First steps toward doing so have been planned but have yet to be widely adopted.

Assessing hospital quality with online tools is also something consumers can do, but it takes effort, particularly if comparing networks of hospitals across plans. There are fewer ways to assess physician quality, but some sites like Yelp and RateMDs.com may be worth a look. None of these tools are integrated into websites that consumers use to shop for marketplace or Medicare Advantage plans, however.

And these resources can’t overcome another challenge some people face — a lack of access to broad network plans. Health insurance markets are local, and a recent Health Affairs study found that Hispanic Americans, for example, live in areas with plans less likely to have very broad networks.

What can be done? Insurers that wish to offer narrow network plans could be required to also offer broad network ones. This would provide a fuller menu of options to more consumers. Additionally, online marketplaces could start to provide much clearer indications of the extent and quality of doctors included in plans’ networks, not just over all but by specialty. Consumers still may not avail themselves of the information, but at least it would be more readily accessible.","Kept in the Dark About Doctors, but Having to Pick a Health Plan",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/upshot/obamacare-doctors-health-plan-enrollment.html

1977年，“性骚扰”这个词还没有法律上的定义，也几乎没有进入公共词汇。而如今，虽然相关讨论已经出现了深刻的转变，但是重读《女士杂志》的那篇文章，似曾相识之感依然萦绕不去。

“我们到目前为止所看到的只是冰山一角，”文章说，“而这座冰山非常庞大、极具破坏性。”

40年后，随着对哈维·韦恩斯坦(Harvey Weinstein)等人的指控继续扩散，感觉就像我们已经撞上了这座冰山。人们争相用各种灾难隐喻来描述这个时刻：海啸、飓风、雪崩、山崩——不过最关键的是，许多有权势的男人的事业以惊人的速度分崩离析。

很多女性，也有一些男性，比以往任何时候都更公开、更有力地说出了自己的故事，它们发生在关闭的门后，甚至是在工作室和新闻编辑室等工作场所的开放空间里。各个公司纷纷重申零容忍政策，匆匆组织相关培训。

“在1970年代的女性运动中，有一个词叫‘醒悟时刻’，”史学家芭芭拉·伯格(Barbara Berg)说。她是2009年出版的《美国的性别歧视：依然活跃，正在毁灭我们的未来》(Sexism in America: Alive, Well and Ruining Our Future)一书的作者。“现在就是醒悟时刻。就像是说，‘够了’。然后就会产生雪球效应：一旦你看到女性对权力说出真相，而不是被告知，‘这就是你必须忍受的’，那么其他女性也会受到鼓励，挺身而出。”

然后就是希尔。伯格称，希尔在电视上指证自己在公平就业机会委员会（偏偏是这个机构）的前上司托马斯，这个行为实际上“教育了一代美国人，让他们知道了什么是性骚扰”。支持职业女性的团体“早九晚五”(9to5)的热线电话几乎立刻被打爆了。

“人们几乎觉得有点困惑，”该团体的负责人1992年接受《纽约时报》采访时说。“你是说这是性骚扰？你是说我可以为此做点什么？”

从“我相信”到#metoo

值得注意的是，当时的运动口号（不是写在Facebook和Twitter上，而是写在徽章和保险杠贴纸上）不是“我也遇到过这种情况”，而是“我相信安妮塔”，这是一个表示团结的讯息，而不是自我暴露。

希尔之后是琼斯，她对克林顿的起诉被驳回。还有些人虽然在法庭上胜诉，后来却陷入困境：海军上尉葆拉·库格林(Paula Coughlin)被几名醉酒军官性侵，她后来遭到排挤，最终只得辞职。遭到律所合伙人骚扰的律师秘书蕾内·威克斯(Rena Weeks)后来再也没有工作过。

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.
Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said.
“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

As a result, legislators have resigned or have been removed from posts, sexual harassment policies have been revised, women’s caucuses have been formed and broad investigations have kicked into gear.

So far, many of the accused have held on to their seats — if not their stature. Some of the accusers have raised questions about whether they are witnessing the beginning of a systemic change or a short-lived political Band-Aid.

“Now they’re doing this because — why?” asked Denise Rotheimer, a political activist and Republican candidate for the Illinois House of Representatives. She complained last year that State Senator Ira Silverstein, the chairman of the Democratic majority caucus, had sent her midnight messages and asked numerous personal questions when she tried to work with him on a bill. “Because the media grabbed onto this? Because now it’s public? Because there’s nothing different from my complaint in November last year to my testimony this year.”

Ms. Rotheimer testified late last month at a state legislative hearing on a fast-moving measure addressing sexual harassment; within a day Mr. Silverstein had resigned his leadership position, though he disputed the charges, according to The Chicago Tribune. (Messages left with his office were not returned.) Lawmakers then moved quickly to appoint an interim legislative inspector general to lead the office charged with receiving and investigating complaints, after the position had sat vacant for about three years.

The upheaval in Illinois is one of many in recent days. And with so many allegations, the speed of repercussions has picked up.

This month, the speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, Jeff Hoover, was reported to have secretly settled with a staff member over claims of sexual harassment. The Republican governor, Matt Bevin, and eight of Mr. Hoover’s fellow Republicans in the House demanded his resignation. Last week, Mr. Hoover stepped down as speaker, though he remained in his House seat. Three other Republican lawmakers — who were also named in the Oct. 25 settlement, The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., reported — were removed from their committee leadership posts pending an investigation.

The president of the Florida Senate ordered an independent investigation and took a powerful chairmanship post from State Senator Jack Latvala, a fellow Republican, who last week was accused of inappropriately touching or making derogatory comments by several women who work at the State Capitol.

On Wednesday, MinnPost, an online news site, reported that several women had described Minnesota State Senator Dan Schoen, a Democrat, making unwanted advances or even grabbing them, prompting immediate calls for his resignation from his fellow lawmakers, including the Senate minority leader and Gov. Mark Dayton, both Democrats. (Mr. Schoen, in a statement, said the allegations were “either completely false or have been taken far out of context.”)

And The Denver Post reported on Friday that Representative Steve Lebsock, a Democrat in the Colorado House, had been accused of sexual harassment by his colleague and fellow party member Faith Winter. House Speaker Crisanta Duran, also a Democrat, quickly urged Mr. Lebsock to step down, and he later apologized for “offending” Ms. Winter.

Both political parties have had to reckon with sexual misconduct allegations as an urgent threat to their power.

“This is a real issue and you want to do the right thing,” said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois at Springfield. In Illinois, Democrats have controlled both chambers in the State Legislature since 2003. “But it is also a potentially very damning political issue when the Democrats have been in charge.”

That dynamic is now in play in Kentucky, where Republicans won complete control of the Legislature last year for the first time in nearly a century. The Democrats they ousted were only two years removed from a sexual harassment scandal that led to the resignation of a Democratic state representative, John Arnold.

So when the Republican House majority leader, Jonathan Shell, insisted on the caucus’s full support for Mr. Hoover in the days after news broke of the sexual harassment settlement, the partisan backstop was unlikely to hold.

“I’m not going to condone or justify inappropriate behavior between membership and staff,” said Representative Robert Benvenuti, a Republican who was a member of the panel investigating Mr. Arnold in 2014.

This month, he was among the eight lawmakers publicly demanding the resignation of Mr. Hoover and others. Mr. Hoover admitted to the settlement in a news conference last week, though he said that the behavior — consisting of “inappropriate text messages”— was consensual and that he was stepping down as speaker mainly to keep the Legislature’s focus on a hotly debated pension crisis.

Whip-smart and unassuming, with meticulous handwriting and an erstwhile fondness for Tetris, Ms. Jones seems suited to a new era — of transformation but also of restraint — at Vanity Fair and Condé Nast.

“In Radhika, we are so proud to have a fearless and brilliant editor whose intelligence and curiosity will define the future of Vanity Fair in the years to come,” Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue and Condé Nast’s artistic director, said in a statement.

A compendium of culture high and low, politics and distinctive visuals, Vanity Fair was resuscitated in 1983, after a 47-year absence, to add some swank and intelligence to the Condé Nast stable in the days before the company had purchased The New Yorker. Its pages have featured the combative essays of Christopher Hitchens, the dishy features of Dominick Dunne and the high-production portraits of Annie Leibovitz — but the magazine has also remained a holdout as its publisher looks to become leaner and less tied to its print titles.

Mr. Carter has said he mulled leaving the magazine earlier this year but for the election of a longtime foil, Donald J. Trump. (The magazine saw a spike in subscriptions after Mr. Trump tweeted last year that the magazine was “Way down, big trouble, dead!”) He had balked at Condé Nast’s belt-tightening and resisted efforts inside the company to consolidate its design, research, photo and copy teams.

It was not a good time at Condé Nast, or anywhere else in the cash-strapped magazine industry, to scoff at cost-cutting. The company expects to bring in $100 million less in revenue this year than it did in 2016, and it is in the middle of laying off 80 employees. This month, it said it was reducing the print frequency of titles like GQ, Glamour and Architectural Digest and shuttering the print edition of Teen Vogue.

To follow Mr. Carter’s long run, executives sought an editor who could carry on Vanity Fair’s journalistic traditions and travel seamlessly between the spheres of Hollywood, Washington and New York. At the same time, the new editor would be charged with taking the title beyond its printed form — and with fewer resources — according to an executive briefed on the selection process.

Guessing Mr. Carter’s replacement became a parlor game at media industry parties. Among the names that surfaced were Adam Moss, the editor of New York magazine; Janice Min, who revitalized Us Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, a columnist at The New York Times and a host of CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

The decision was ultimately up to Robert Sauerberg, the chief executive of Condé Nast, who oversaw the search along with Ms. Wintour. David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, was also heavily involved.

It was Mr. Remnick who brought in and championed Ms. Jones, the executive said, and she eventually won over the others.

“We didn’t need a name for the sake of a name or a celebrity,” Steven O. Newhouse, a nephew of the late Samuel I. Newhouse and a top executive at Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications, said in an interview. “We really wanted someone who could do the job and be a worthy successor to Graydon, and I think we found someone.”

“She has vision and energy and a very active mind,” Mr. Newhouse added, “and I think that’s what Vanity Fair needs.”

Ms. Jones was the only candidate Mr. Newhouse met.

A product of Ridgefield, Conn., by way of New York and Cincinnati, Ms. Jones graduated from Harvard College and received a doctoral degree in English and comparative literature from Columbia University. She has lived in Taipei and Moscow, where she got her start in journalism as the arts editor at The Moscow Times, an English-language newspaper. (Her Russian, she said, is rusty.)

Many editors in her position would proclaim their love of magazines, particularly the one they are about to sit atop, but Ms. Jones was characteristically candid.

“It’s hard for me to exactly figure out when I became obsessed with magazines,” she said.

Did she read Vanity Fair growing up?

“On and off,” she said.

She declined to describe her plans for Vanity Fair. “I need to get oriented first — there’s a lot to take in,” she said. She also demurred when asked about any writers she was considering. “I’m just really interested in discovery,” she said.

Ms. Jones, who joined The Times last November, is not the first person to make the move from Times books coverage to the top editorial position at Vanity Fair. In 1981, as Condé Nast announced its plan to revive the Jazz Age title, it appointed Richard Locke, an editor at The New York Times Book Review, to run it. “We take risks,” Alexander Liberman, then Condé Nast’s editorial director, said when asked about the selection.

Mr. Locke was replaced by a Condé Nast veteran, Leo Lerman, four issues into his run.

Those who know Ms. Jones believe she will thrive, citing her academic background as well as the breadth of her interests. Before she joined The Times, she was a deputy managing editor at Time magazine, where she transformed the Time 100 franchise into an eclectic mix of celebrities and unheralded visionaries. After the issue’s corresponding annual gala, she would host an all-night karaoke party at a Midtown dive. At The Paris Review, the literary quarterly able to make a young writer’s career, she served as managing editor.

“She once referred to herself as a ‘formerly shy person,’ as someone who had to learn how to speak out,” said Nancy Gibbs, who recently stepped down as the top editor at Time. “She doesn’t come on incredibly strong. She doesn’t overpower you with her ideas — she’s a different kind of presence.”

In his quarter century at Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter parlayed its editorship into elite social status. A party host, producer of documentary films and Broadway shows, political commentator and restaurateur, he became part of the celebrity fabric. On his watch, Vanity Fair’s annual post-Oscar party became one of the year’s most glittery, star-studded affairs.

It is perhaps inevitable that Ms. Jones will invite comparisons with Mr. Carter, just as he had to live up to the expectations of readers who had grown to love the version of Vanity Fair created by his predecessor, Tina Brown. Some in the media world are already scrutinizing her experience for signs she will not measure up, particularly when it comes to Mr. Carter’s ability to navigate Hollywood.

Her supporters reject any notion she will not succeed on every level. And in case anyone was wondering, yes, she will preside over the 2018 Oscar party.

“The reality is, she has incredible credentials to direct a magazine that’s so focused on culture,” Mr. Newhouse said.

“I think that she’s fully capable of all the elements of Vanity Fair,” he added. “Obviously, you don’t start out — as Graydon didn’t start out — the way that Graydon ended up.”","Radhika Jones, Vanity Fair’s Surprise Choice, Is Ready to Go",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/radhika-jones-vanity-fair.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

‘I can no longer endorse his candidacy’

Mr. McConnell made his most recent comments to reporters on Monday at a news conference about the Republican tax plan. He said party leaders were considering a write-in option. Watch the video here.

On Thursday, Mr. McConnell had made a more qualified statement, saying that Mr. Moore should step aside before the Dec. 12 special election if the allegations were true.

Susan Collins of Maine made a similar shift on Monday, dropping her initial “if true” caveat and calling on Mr. Moore to withdraw from the race.

Todd Young of Indiana made the same demand on Monday in his first statement on the allegations, saying that if Mr. Moore did not step aside, “we need to act to protect the integrity of the Senate.”

“After giving Roy Moore ample time to unequivocally deny the disturbing allegations against him, those allegations remain far more persuasive than the denials,” Mr. Young said. “Roy Moore should immediately drop out of the race. The appearance of grossly reprehensible behavior disqualifies him from service in the United States Senate.”

Four other Republican senators — John McCain of Arizona, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Steve Daines of Montana and Mike Lee of Utah — unequivocally renounced Mr. Moore last week.

Mr. McCain was the first, tweeting on Thursday that Mr. Moore should step aside.

Mr. Lee tweeted on Friday, “Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate.” Mr. Daines and Mr. Cassidy quickly followed.

A fifth senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, wrote that Mr. Moore should never have been nominated to begin with.

And Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said in an interview with KCCI-TV on Friday that Mr. Moore “should step aside,” but added: “The trouble is, if he agreed to step aside, his name is still on the ballot. People can still vote for him, and he could get elected.”

‘If true …’

By far the most common reaction has been a call for Mr. Moore to step aside if the allegations were true. That was the first response of more than 30 senators, though none explained what criteria they would use to judge the truth of the accusations.

If the allegations are true, “I don’t think this candidacy is sustainable,” John Cornyn of Texas said, “but we believe in a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and so I think it’s important for the facts to come out.” Texas’ other senator, Ted Cruz, called the reports “serious and troubling” but added, “Judge Moore has the right to respond.”

Lamar Alexander, John Barrasso, Shelley Moore Capito, Michael B. Enzi, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, Orrin G. Hatch, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, James M. Inhofe, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Jerry Moran, Lisa Murkowski, David Perdue, Jim Risch, Pat Roberts, Mike Rounds, Marco Rubio, Richard C. Shelby, Dan Sullivan, John Thune and Thom Tillis also made “if true” statements.

Others, though they included the caveat, seemed more inclined to jettison Mr. Moore. Jeff Flake of Arizona said Mr. Moore should step aside “if there is any shred of truth to the allegations,” and Ben Sasse of Nebraska spoke similarly.

Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Tim Scott of South Carolina said they found the accusations more believable than Mr. Moore’s denials; Rob Portman of Ohio said he assumed they were true because the women making them were on the record. On Monday, Roy Blunt of Missouri released a similar statement.

“The women have a more credible story than Judge Moore,” said Mr. Blunt, who had previously been silent on the allegations. “Alabama voters should have a better choice, and Judge Moore should have better answers to these charges.”

And Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Mr. Moore “should be dealt with very severely” if he behaved as reported.

“Any person who believes these allegations are not that bad,” Mr. Graham told ABC’s affiliate in Columbia, S.C., “I don’t want them to be a part of the Republican Party.”

‘Start thinking about who they’ll write in’

Photo

It is too late to replace Mr. Moore on the ballot, but Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Sasse, Mr. Toomey and now Mr. McConnell have floated the idea of a write-in campaign — perhaps by Luther Strange, who holds the seat Mr. Moore is seeking but lost the Republican primary. (Last week Mr. Strange called the report “very, very disturbing” and said he would later have “something to say” about whether he would re-enter the race.)

“If there’s an ounce of truth to any of this, Roy Moore has no place in public life and ought to drop out immediately,” Mr. Sasse said. “Alabamians should start thinking about who they’ll write in.”

Ms. Murkowski, who won a write-in campaign herself after losing a primary in 2010, told Politico on Thursday that she had spoken with Mr. Strange, who told reporters he was researching his options.

But “a write-in is very difficult, let’s face it,” Mr. Toomey acknowledged. “There’s no easy solution to this.”

‘They’re very, very old charges’

Only one senator, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, explicitly declined to suggest that Mr. Moore step down, even with the “if true” caveat. Why, he asked, didn’t the women who spoke to The Post come forward earlier?

“They’re very, very old charges,” Mr. Wicker told Mississippi News Now. “You have to ask, and I think people in Alabama will be asking, why this hasn’t come out in the 40 years’ time with him running for so many offices.”

I own a house in Maplewood, N.J., and am wondering: Does it ever make sense to rent out your house rather than sell it? Are there any advantages to renting?

A. Before you crunch numbers, decide if you want to be a landlord. Are you prepared to take a call at 3 a.m. when the heat fails during a blizzard in January? If the dishwasher won’t work properly, you will be expected to fix the problem immediately. If the rent is late (or does not arrive) you will have to chase the tenant for the money, and maybe even take the case to housing court.

“Being a landlord isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants in Manhattan.

Generally, renters do not maintain homes the way owners do. Consider the finicky dishwasher: If you own the house and the dishwasher is on its last legs, you might hold out until you can afford a new stainless steel model that matches the newer refrigerator. But a tenant will expect a functioning dishwasher pronto, and so, chances are, you will swap out the aging one with a cheap white model.

“I’ve had people who’ve rented their homes and they come back and it’s never the house they left,” said Allison Maguire, a sales associate for Halstead in Montclair, N.J. “No one takes care of a rental as if it’s their true home.”

To make your decision, research the rental market, as its fluctuations are not necessarily tied to the sales market. With the help of a broker, estimate how much rent you could fetch: Would it be enough to cover the mortgage and taxes? Consider other expenses, too, like landscaping services, and insurance. Ask your accountant about tax implications. Factor in vacancies and repairs. You may need to hire a property manager if, for example, you move out of the area.

Tally your estimated profit for the number of years you anticipate renting out the house. Then compare that figure with the cash you would walk away with should you sell your house today. Is the potential payoff worth the headache of being a landlord? It might be. But being a landlord is a job, and you have to decide if it is one you want.

Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang.","So, wow, imagine we get there: total autonomy. Manual driving is outlawed. Our cars are better drivers than we ever were. And not only that, they coordinate with one another in an elegant choreography, threading through traffic with inches to spare. Parking becomes parkland, because no cars ever stay still for long; they stop only to recharge themselves as needed. If you choose, you can just hang out at home and let the robocars bring you everything you need. But even if that future does arrive, it would come with a trunkful of nagging questions. What does it feel like to live in that world? And how does 21st-century society — which has been built, in ways large and small, around human drivers — change and reconfigure when they all become mere riders? In the pages that follow, we begin to wonder at some answers.

Cities Without Signs Street signage is the iconography of the automobile age. It’s like highly functional pop art: silhouettes of schoolchildren, white arrows, rectangular cries of WRONG WAY and, most central of all, the ubiquitous stoplight. The traffic light might be the first part of that iconographic world to be transformed, or vanish altogether, once we are fully in the age of autonomous cars. Robots, after all, won’t need signs to optimize the way they move through urban landscapes. Urban-transportation experts have been busily creating computer simulations to show how this might work. In one model, each crossroads would have an “intersection manager,” a computer that senses the approaching traffic and uses wireless communication to talk to the oncoming cars. When each self-driving car is perhaps 300 yards away, it sends a request to the intersection manager — to turn right, say, or to move on through. The intersection manager then does an on-the-fly calculation to route that vehicle most efficiently, like an omnipotent and tireless traffic cop. The result? A ballet of cars whizzing and weaving past one another in the intersection. Some slow down as they approach; others pass straight through. But crucially, compared with today’s intersections, many fewer cars come to a complete halt. This could significantly speed up traffic throughout an entire city. Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin who works with one model, has found that the “delay” time at intersections shrinks remarkably. “Right now, it takes me an average of 20 minutes to get to work, but with autonomous-car intersections, it might be half that time,” he says. Safety would be enhanced, too: Forty-three percent of car crashes in the United States occur at intersections, and Stone predicts that robot vehicles would crash only if there was a mechanical error. Better yet, autonomous intersections could produce an estimated 20 to 50 percent less carbon dioxide, because there would be fewer idling cars and jack-rabbit starts. “That’s the most expensive and most polluting part of driving,” says Remi Tachet des Combes, a mathematician who created robot-intersection models while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For the human passenger, though, a robotized intersection could be mildly terrifying — like flying through a crowded asteroid belt, trusting the A.I. to find the right path. “At first I think it will be freaky,” Stone admits. “Some people will need the window darkened so they don’t freak out.” But in the long run, we’ll probably shrug, get used to it and barely look up from our games of Candy Crush as we zip through. And pedestrians? They would probably push a button at the intersection to request their turn — or even use a smartphone app. More subtly unsettling, however, might be the spectacle of a city devoid of stoplights. Indeed, devoid of all major street signs: no huge billboards across highways naming the exits, no complex merge instructions. Those signs are expensive to build and maintain. They’re designed for humans, and GPS-brained robots don’t need them to know where they’re going. Certainly, human pedestrians and cyclists will still need guideposts, but as Stone suspects, far fewer, and smaller, ones. A world with almost no street signs would feel strange. It could make a city less cluttered and more attractive. But it might also leave us feeling unmoored. Social critics worry that GPS has already eroded our knowledge of the city; some studies have found that the more we rely on devices, the less we deeply intuit where we are and how to navigate on our own. “We become more helpless,” as Greg Milner, the author of “Pinpoint,” a history of GPS, told me. If robots rule the roads, we might get where we’re going a lot more quickly — but end up not knowing precisely where we are.

Visual Design by Maryam Heidaripour

Picturing the Self-Driving City Marshall Brown, an associate professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, recently traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich., to visit the Mcity Test Facility, the University of Michigan’s 32-acre testing ground for automated vehicles. Mcity, which looks like a soundstage of a midcentury suburb, is a simulator: It has no actual residents. Still, Brown found it “bizarre and frankly frightening” that it looked as though the track had been designed almost entirely by transportation experts, not urban planners or architects. He identified it as part of a larger problem: As technologists imagine the driverless world, they seem to be doing so with a distinct lack of imagination. Brown is a creator of the Driverless City Project, an interdisciplinary research initiative at I.I.T. that takes a playful, rigorous approach to envisioning the fully autonomous future. The project helps participants generate various situations for a city in order to determine how autonomous cars will fit into the picture. Central to the project is a “mind map” representing the group’s research, organized into four areas of impact: street space, parking space, commuter space and delivery space. The map, as well as other tools — including a set of large tokens for scenario building, like a tarot deck for urbanists — is meant to encourage others to be ambitious and creative about the world in which they want to live. “We should write the future,” Brown says, “rather than trying to predict it.” Brown has found two prevalent attitudes when it comes to self-driving vehicles: either an active but unimaginative approach, rushing to build robots to accommodate the world as it is now, or a totally passive approach, a sort of “wait and see.” The first, he says, is characteristic of the tech industry; the second, of the public sector. “I hear too much surrendering in the question about our future right now,” he adds. “Just surrendering to Google or Amazon, or surrendering to your phone, or surrendering to a driverless car. We should not surrender.” One way to stave off surrender, Brown believes, is to invite more diverse thinkers, like architects and urban planners, into the process of imagining and designing the autonomous future. (He also listed sociologists, fiction writers, Buddhist monks, poets and rabbis as useful stakeholders.) The current discourse around the future of autonomous vehicles is centered on “technologically deterministic fantasies,” Brown says. He’s concerned that technological values — like logic, predictability and efficiency — will be erroneously imposed upon the built environment, leading to urban spaces that fail to take into account delight, pleasure or human connection. “A society is cultural, and political, and aesthetic, and about desires — it’s not just how you solve problems,” he says. “They’re going to need more than just software engineers working on it.” As an architect, Brown is especially attuned to the unlocked aesthetic potential of urban environments. Today’s visual clutter, necessary for keeping human-driven cars as nonlethal as possible, could be eradicated. It is critical, in his view, to consider the beauty and quality of the world that self-driving cars could bring. It’s worth considering, then, where cars will go when people don’t need them. “What happens when a car can park itself anywhere?” Brown asks. He hypothesizes that parking, if performed robotically, could become “a negative externality, not unlike that of a trash dump,” should developers repurpose garages and parking lots for more lucrative uses. (Why look for parking in Greenwich Village if the car can park itself on the edge of New Jersey?) In the Midwest, he speculates, deindustrialized cities with waning property values could even be bought wholesale and transformed into vast, flat parking lots — a future that he deemed plausible, if “too dystopian,” in no small part because of the likelihood that it would be pushed upon lower-income communities. On the other hand, those same communities could benefit from increased mobility and access to employment. Brown is also considering the changes to storage: If robotic trucks constantly roam our landscape, will warehouses be abandoned? He’s focused on the changing needs and desires of a human driver. To accommodate an autonomous, cross-country route, truck cabs, he speculates, may need to expand according to a driver’s needs, perhaps going so far as to resemble a microapartment. An emphasis (or lack thereof) on efficiency also addresses the temporal dimension of cities: It favors — or facilitates — a working lifestyle in which there is never enough time. In a future of increased automation and accessibility, work culture may begin to shift; labor, and its attendant time constraints, may no longer be central to the urban experience. Brown envisions the possibility of a hands-free commute that opens up space for socializing — “an interior social world.” Riders could chat with people in adjacent cars or simply take the opportunity to watch the world go by. (A more cynical take on this, he says, is that the hands-free commute will simply increase the demands on workers, as the car becomes an extension of the home office — a WeWork on wheels.) Second-order effects of autonomous vehicles tend to get lost in the techno-utopian chatter, but there seems to be an increasing awareness that self-driving cars won’t just arrive in cities; they’ll change them too. Some tech companies are beginning to get into data-driven city-building, a movement largely galvanized by the seeming inevitability of autonomous vehicles. Last year, Y Combinator announced a research initiative, New Cities, that aimed to study how to build a metropolis entirely from scratch. In mid-October, Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet subsidiary, announced that it will redevelop a 12-acre strip along Toronto’s waterfront, called Quayside, which will integrate technology across the human experience. The vehicles it is planning to accommodate will be shared, electric and self-driving. Power and control over autonomous-vehicle technology is already concentrated in the hands of a small few: If a company like Uber or Alphabet controls the dominant transportation infrastructure, you need not live in an intentional community like Quayside to feel as though your city is becoming a company town. Brown is wary of the smart-cities initiative, and he resents the efforts of technology companies to fully saturate the human — and urban — experience. “A city is not a problem to be solved,” he says. “A city is a cultural construct, even though it involves the deployment of technologies. A city is not science alone.” Anna Wiener is a writer based in San Francisco.

The Augmented-Reality Windshield For obvious reasons, our present-day cars are designed for keen observation of the outside world, offering a nearly panoramic view of the road and landscape through panels of glass. The parade of images flitting past a car’s windows can be exhilarating or can induce a kind of pleasurable trance. By virtue of being transparent and inert, however, windows are inherently limited. Although we have begun to augment the car’s field of vision with new layers of information — phones suction-cupped to the windshield, or GPS built into the dashboard — there is still so much useful knowledge just out of reach. Today’s windows allow you to scope out a parking spot or search for that tiny cafe with the faded sign, but they can’t help you find them. Nor can they show you exactly where that highway exit will lead or identify the odd building you just passed. Tomorrow’s could. Unlike Google Glass — which awkwardly placed screens where they didn’t need to be — a car already requires a membrane between passengers and their environment. Why not turn that typically passive barrier into a dynamic canvas? Ordinary windows could be replaced with holographic glass or an advanced semitranslucent liquid-crystal display. They could anticipate our needs and instantaneously display weather forecasts, reviews of nearby restaurants and hotels, details about popular tourist attractions — and warnings about miserable tourist traps. As the technology improves and people become more comfortable obscuring their surroundings, your windows could begin to overlay a vast digital diorama onto passing scenery. Passengers would no longer have to wonder about the identity of a landmark and scramble to look it up on their phones. Instead, the car itself, wired with artificial intelligence, plugged into sophisticated mapping technology and equipped with magic eyes, would instantaneously recognize, annotate and augment its surroundings. A mountain, desert or coastline could become an interactive infographic, peeling away the physical surface of the earth to reveal hidden layers of geology. A self-directed double-decker bus ambling through London could rearrange the city like a Lego set, refashioning streets and buildings to illuminate the capital’s rich history. Early television sets made the distant accessible; the self-driving car could reveal the invisible in the immediate. As exciting as such possibilities are, recent history suggests plenty of reasons to temper our optimism. When windows double as screens, we will have the opportunity to gaze at the world anew through richly animated portals. Alternatively — and perhaps more realistically — we could end up staring into larger versions of our phones, distracting ourselves with email, mindless games and the infinite bazaar of the internet. The potential of the autonomous vehicle is to help us interact with our environment in ways never before possible. The temptation is to turn ever more inward, exchanging the physical world for yet another simulation. Either way, self-driving cars with ubiquitous screens will inevitably bring all the familiar drawbacks of digital media onto the open road. Taxi TV in New York City is just a preview of the potential nightmare. What if the price for enchanted windows of the future is a nauseating kaleidoscope of advertisements, vapid movie reviews and contextless late-night jokes? Rather than learning about the hidden history of your surroundings, you may very well learn only about two-for-one cricket tacos in the food truck a lane over, homeowner’s insurance for the Anthropocene or the sale on microdrones at a nearby mall.

The Seizure of Commuting Time One big question about the driverless car will be who gets to own our new wealth of free time. Will it remain with commuters — or will corporations expect them to tap into the office as their vehicles ferry them there? While the potential for hours of unplugged leisure exists, the way we currently fill our downtime leads me to believe that some form of digital immersion will take precedence, as bosses expect employees to work on their way to and from work. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the remaining minimum-wage positions in the rapidly automating food industry go to those who have access to driverless cars; use their cars for deliveries while they work, and you get two employees for the price of one. It’s tricky. On their surface, driverless cars will take some of the mess out of living, but they can also take the living where they don’t want to go, both psychologically and physically. Some car interiors might more closely resemble cubicles. Or cells. Will private employers surveil workers in order to control off-duty behavior? It’s also easy to conceive of a future where newly created infrastructure, explicitly dedicated to automated vehicles, will enable people with the means to own the cars to avoid the people without. We should be wary of any technology that allows those with power to distance themselves even further from society. Rahawa Haile is an Eritrean-American writer of short stories and essays.

Nonstop Teenage Party In a short essay published in 1970, the British architect David Greene suggested that his colleagues pay more attention to cars. “A traffic jam is a collection of rooms,” he explained, and “so is a car park — they are really instantly formed and constantly changing communities.” It was a memorable observation that nonetheless would surprise few teenagers, who long ago embraced the transformative notion that cars are not just rooms, but rooms they can control. Autonomous cars will once again transform teenage life. Anab Jain, a founder of the design studio Superflux, says the ritual requirements of teenage socializing will inspire “a new range of acts and services that help you obfuscate your car’s identity or your own data.” Instead of trying to roll back the odometer on the family car à la Ferris Bueller, teenagers hoping to roam the city, free from parental view, might trick it into recording destinations they didn’t really visit. “The whole notion of freedom will change,” Jain says, even as some of the destinations remain familiar. Dark streets or quiet state parks where GPS doesn’t reach would be the coolest sites of all. The question of when, exactly, the party has started will also become an intriguing one: After all, each car is a room unto itself. The Situationist International, a loose group of artists, political agitators and heavy drinkers who roamed the streets of Paris and other cities in the 1960s, treating them as arenas for detours and debauchery, offers some clues about how such rooms could be transformed. “I only ever hear self-driving cars talked about as a functional solution to the problem of getting from A to B,” says McKenzie Wark, the author of a history of the Situationists called “The Beach Beneath the Street.” (The title is a reference to the sand that was revealed when protesters picked up cobblestones from the Paris streets to throw at the police.) Wark imagines these machines rolling out of the factory with more radical settings hard-wired into their operating systems. “A hybrid of the self-driving car and, say, Grindr could bring a whole new meaning to the concept of cruising,” Wark suggests. “There should be a ‘scenic route’ setting, a ‘random’ setting, a ‘surprise me’ setting. Or maybe ‘mystery destination,’ which whisks you — and algorithmically chosen others — to an undisclosed location. Algorithmic chicken for teenage drivers, where you drive head-on toward another car — then magically swerve off at the last minute.” Unlike today’s cars, autonomous cars can also be made to swarm together, creating somewhat of a paradox: a moving traffic jam. Once the swarm is formed, proximity algorithms could mine social-media profiles to arrange like-minded clusters, while enabling “shuffle mode” might one day be the equivalent of texting a friend to rescue you from the boring guy in the corner. Aspiring D.J.s will rely on software to assemble self-driving cars into the ideal configuration for louder bass. Couples armed with GPS jammers — the future’s perfect Valentine’s Day gift — will quietly steer strangers away, creating a halo of romantic privacy around their makeout sessions. If all else fails, hit “skip” to be transported to an entirely new party. Hidden beneath the hormone haze of future block parties, new opportunities for cultural pranks and political protest will emerge. Rather than throw cobblestones, protesters could quickly jam the streets to show political solidarity or organize a strike. With the right programming skills, they might be able to shut down a whole city just by blocking a few crucial nodes. They could even open the streets back up to foot traffic, remaking them as a space for celebration. Then, of course, when it’s time to go home, all those dull factory presets, optimized for safety and efficiency, will finally come into their own — no designated driver necessary.

Your Autonomous Dealer Drug dealers tend to choose cars at the extremes — on the one hand a cocaine-white G-Wagen, on the other a ’98 Toyota Tercel. Each suggests a kind of shady guarantee that the self-driving car isn’t likely to sustain. Like most new stuff from Silicon Valley, the autonomous car is bound to be cute — a gumdrop whip fit for a Pixar protagonist. Hardly what you dream of when you’re trying to score. If drugs are still cool, they’ll have stayed that way in part because of their illicitness and the mild supply-line chaos that brute fact engenders: the inconsistent product, unreliable hookups and hours spent waiting for the dealer to arrive. Self-driving cars will succeed only by reducing and avoiding such chaos as much as possible. If these two industries are ever to play nice, then the success of one will come at the cost of the cool-guy reputation of the other. In the self-driving future, a weed transaction will begin the same as always — by texting your dealer in search of “tree,” or by casually asking if he wants to “hang out.” En route to another customer’s house, he will text back immediately, freed from the imposition of two hands on the wheel. Memories of waiting impatiently on a flaky dealer will recede as his car appears on your app, predicting arrival time down to the minute. Watch as his vehicle weaves around school zones, or is maybe flagged and pulled over by the police. The new possibilities for surveillance are endless. In any case, if he makes it to your house, it is likely that he will emerge from his self-driving pod in a sweatshirt for a company with a name like TōkTaxi or Gangl.ly or Lyft’d. As weed begins to trend toward legality, we’ve already seen such standing-desk branding start to creep into the stoner vernacular. A scan down PC Magazine’s “15 Blazing Hot Weed Tech Companies to Watch” reveals Tokken (a blockchain system for dealers), MassRoots (a stoner social network) and Eaze (the obligatory “Uber for weed”). In this new age of cannabis, the only thing that moves faster than the tech is the rate at which smoking itself becomes corny. But cringe-worthy orthography is not the only thing that this self-driven industry will inherit from Silicon Valley. In the age of semiautonomous cars, dealers will be forced to file 1099s, sharing their profits as lowly subcontractors. As in the time when dealers drove themselves, this fleet of buddies-for-hire will offer five to 10 minutes of humanity-affirming chitchat. Unlike preautonomous dealers, they will plead that you tweet their referral codes in order to receive a complimentary edible. This, of course, is one good reason to strive for fully autonomous drugmobiles. The driverless vehicle eliminates small talk, supplying your fix directly from the glove box with a personalized passcode, à la Amazon Locker. With no human body attached to the cargo, suppliers will seek to move harder drugs, in bigger quantities, potentially unleashing a new set of problems. The narc, a liability throughout all of human history, isn’t likely to go anywhere soon. Self-driving cars will scan for hazards in the street but will also pickup telltale signs of an informant: nervous twitches, too-enthusiastic slang. A customer might even be asked to answer a question like, “Are you a cop?” (Because, as all drug dealers know, a real cop has to say yes, even to an A.I.) It is likely that a database of narcs will be compiled, and inevitably, this database of narcs will be hacked. Millions of Americans will be exposed as poseurs — a social problem tragically immune to disruption. Jamie Lauren Keiles is a writer in New York.

Policing With No Tickets The temptation is the greatest on nights when the evening rush seems to congeal around the car, and she just wants to be home. She waits until she has left downtown (too many traffic towers), and then, with a few taps to a screen, she goes for it. Chinese software hacks come well recommended, and it’s soon clear why: The car picks up speed and begins to weave through the slower traffic — pleasingly aggressive but more sure in its lines, with less lurching, than the typical Russian black-market goods. She returns to her movie, but before long she hears a chime and a grating alert: “Traffic ticket assessed.” She spots a police car speeding past, a quad drone fixed to the roof, as her own vehicle reverts to its factory settings and rejoins the docile march of the lemmings. In the coming world of ubiquitous self-driving, it will just be you, the open road and the vast apparatus of the nanny state. Cars won’t readily violate traffic laws and may well be legally required to report on their owners. Ignore that burned-out headlight for too long, and the overnight software update may include a virtual boot. Traffic tickets bring in billions of dollars annually, so all those well-behaved cars will have an economic impact. Governments that have historically viewed traffic citations as an extractive industry (Ferguson, Mo., say, or the State of California) will have no choice but to find alternatives. Far more consequential, for both the police and their communities, will be the death of the routine traffic stop. The Supreme Court has ruled that law enforcement may stop any car, whatever its true motive, as long as an infraction is observed. Human drivers can’t get far without breaking the letter of the traffic law, so the pretexts come easy. If officers then spot a dozen laptops stacked on the back seat, they can ask questions. Yet this broad, virtually unchecked power to stop has led to charges of racial profiling. (A recent linguistic analysis of bodycam footage from Oakland, Calif., for example, concluded that officers spoke “with consistently less respect toward black versus white community members.”) With pretexts largely automated away, these kinds of interactions will be rare. “The self-driving car,” says Elizabeth Joh, a professor at the U.C. Davis School of Law, “will come to be seen as a civil rights issue.” The police will have lost an important investigative tool, but the government will have gained new surveillance possibilities. Cars will sweep up vast amounts of data about their surroundings and their occupants, including 24/7 GPS trails. (An important Fourth Amendment case being heard this fall, Carpenter v. United States, will decide whether the government needs a warrant to gain access to cellphone locational data, setting a precedent that could apply to cars.) Another potential target is the pedestrian. In the first part of the 20th century, manufacturers lobbied to make “jaywalking” a crime, so the new horseless carriages could cruise along urban streets relatively unimpeded. The pedestrians of the future, emboldened by the fact that self-driving cars are sure to stop, could cause havoc. No worries, though: Facial-recognition technology is coming along nicely, and the automotive industry will be, if anything, even more powerful. Look for today’s complaints about speeding tickets to be replaced by stories of “jaywalking traps” and pitiless fines for a second offense. Gareth Cook is a contributing writer for the magazine.

The Rise and Fall of Aquacars Looking back at the decades when the autonomous car was developed, you may find it hard to believe that its engineers imagined that it would stay landbound. All along, sea levels continued to rise, gradually overwhelming the sea walls that many coastal cities built as protection and flooding the (now absurdly named) ground floor of apartment and office buildings. Rather than simply abandon these buildings, though, many residents chose to stay — fueling a demand for autonomous aquacars and, as that technology improved, for mobile aquahomes. This became especially true after the successful completion of the SeaOrbiter, a floating laboratory originally designed for oceanography research. Elegant and semisubmersible, the SeaOrbiter acted as a kind of prototype for local offshore living — and the rise of aerial drone delivery, originally pioneered by Amazon, made the challenge of resupplying straightforward. Unfortunately, hackers quickly figured out how to hijack the aquahomes’ navigation system — first by disabling it and then with programs that directed vessels to floating “chop shops” run by roving gangs of ship-breakers. Piracy rates dropped only after huge kelp growth, driven by a mix of ocean warming and overfishing, rendered the submerged communities as unnavigable by aquacars as they had been by roadbound ones.

Two years after an 83-year-old Westchester County socialite was found bludgeoned to death on her 300-acre horse farm, rattling the community, a man has been indicted in her murder.

Esdras Marroquin Gomez, a former laborer on the North Salem, N.Y., farm was arrested in Mexico over the weekend and charged in the death of Lois Colley, according to a spokeswoman for the Westchester County district attorney’s office.

Ms. Colley’s body was discovered in a laundry room of her family estate, Windswept Farm, on Nov. 9, 2015. She had suffered blunt trauma to the skull, the police said. There was no sign of forced entry to the home. A weapon was never recovered, though a small fire extinguisher was said to be missing from the home.

An active member of the community about 50 miles north of New York City, Ms. Colley and her husband, Eugene, had built the couple’s fortune through McDonald’s franchises.

In the two years since the crime, the hayfields and horse paddocks were searched by law enforcement officers, and scores of workers and members of the wealthy agrarian community were interviewed by investigators. Police divers searched fruitlessly in the Titicus Reservoir across a small lane from the estate.

But Transworld’s employees did not have personal knowledge, the consumer bureau said in its complaint against the debt collector.

Other companies had created the records reviewed by Transworld employees. Those workers, the consumer bureau said, did not know how the data was maintained and whether it was correct. Even so, employees signed the forms “for fear of losing their jobs,” according to the bureau’s complaint.

The hasty review process obscured defects. More than 800 cases involved apparent time travel: In those instances, Transworld employees swore that borrowers’ loans had been purchased by investors on dates that were months or even years before the loans were actually made.

Transworld, based in Fort Washington, Pa., said it disagreed with many of the consumer bureau’s accusations. The company agreed to settle the case, it said in a statement, to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation.

The company’s review process “accords with all industry best practices and relevant law,” David Zwick, Transworld’s chief financial officer, said in a statement to The Times.

Transworld “processes thousands of affidavits, and while our error rate is exceptionally low, we believe that any mistake is unacceptable,” Mr. Zwick said. “We will continue to regularly review everything we do in order to ensure the highest standards of quality control.”

Lisa Kyser, in Pataskala, Ohio, said she got tangled up in one of Transworld’s mistakes. She took out half a dozen student loans as she juggled her college studies with full-time jobs, but she thought she had all of them under control.

In June 2016, Ms. Kyser got a summons notifying her that she was being sued for falling behind on a $12,000 loan made in 2006. Two weeks later, she got a second summons also seeking payment — to a different creditor, for a different amount — on the same loan.

“I called the opposing counsel from both firms and said, ‘You can’t both be right,’” said Emily White, a lawyer in Columbus, Ohio, who represented Ms. Kyser.

The cases lingered for five months, while Ms. Kyser racked up legal fees. In the end, after her lawyer continually pestered them, the law firms that sued Ms. Kyser — both working for Transworld — withdrew the cases.

Courts Digging Deeper

The stacks of legal documents Transworld prepared in that Georgia office park made their way to courts across the country.

Many of the cases sailed through, unchallenged. Borrowers often do not fight collection lawsuits, which allows the creditor to win by default.

Even when defendants did respond, some judges brushed off their objections. In Miami, a law firm working for Transworld brought a lawsuit last year against Antonio Fuentes, seeking payment on a $13,356 student loan. With interest and fees, Mr. Fuentes now owed $25,322.31, according to the complaint.

Mr. Fuentes, representing himself, admitted that he had taken the loan but disputed the amount he was said to owe. A Transworld employee swore in an affidavit that the tally was correct. The judge sided with Transworld and ordered Mr. Fuentes to pay the full amount.

“The courts are often not sympathetic to these cases,” said N. James Turner, a lawyer in Orlando, Fla., who represents borrowers. “Many judges take the attitude: ‘I paid my student loans. You ought to pay yours. Don’t give me this nonsense about technicalities.’”

But some judges are starting to raise questions about collection cases.

Last year, a California appeals court cast doubt on the company’s affidavits. Employees of Transword, then known as NCO Financial Systems, were not “personally familiar” with the records they swore were accurate, the judges wrote, and therefore could not vouch for them in court. The case was tossed out.

It’s not just debt collectors facing judicial skepticism, but also the creditors themselves.

No matter where you lived in New York, sooner or later all roads led to 116th Street and Lexington Avenue, the commercial and cultural heart of East Harlem.

Joseph Rodriguez was no exception: Though born and raised in Brooklyn — with detours at Rikers and a life-changing encounter with photography — he, as a teenager, liked to hang out at his uncle’s candy store and numbers spot where the streets were abuzz with music and life. Those early encounters led to a May 1990 National Geographic cover story and the most important project of his life after he spent the latter half of the 1980’s photographing El Barrio’s streets and residents in their homes and on the block.

Now, a revised version of that body of work will be on display at the Bronx Documentary Center, as well as in the new book, “Spanish Harlem: El Barrio in the ’80s.”

While it is “easy to make gritty pictures of poverty,” Mr. Rodriguez was looking to go deeper and connect with people whose struggles he knew intimately as the son of a single mother.

“I carried this story for a long time before I could go out and make the work,” he said. “That was an important path for me to understand patience and waiting, connecting and trust.”

His images reflect an intimacy — and long-term commitment — that marks his later work in East Los Angeles, Romania and Puerto Rico. For him, this project was deeply personal, and still is.

“We’re not garbage people, we have a presence,” he said. “One thing that was extremely important was to show our children with some dignity. You see their strength. We’ve gone through hell and back, just like now in Puerto Rico. But we get up, and we fight back.”

Our team is going to evolve two or three more times over the course of the season — I think everyone here knows that.”Scary thought.
All that extra prep time forced Carlisle to field questions from pesky reporters about the Cavaliers’ bumpy launch on no fewer than four occasions.
“A lot of people would like to have their struggles,” he said of the Cavs.
Let’s safely assume that includes Cleveland’s Monday night opponents, even as Kristaps Porzingis Fever justifiably spreads throughout Gotham.","Although some opposing coaches would nominate Houston’s James Harden, Rick Carlisle of the Mavericks contends that Cleveland’s James, at nearly 33 years old, remains the hardest singular force to game-plan against and “is still in his prime.”

“And he’s playing virtually every position on the floor for them right now, which is pretty unprecedented if you really think about it,” Carlisle said.

The cynic, however, would undoubtedly retort that James, four times the league’s most valuable player, has to do that much for the Cavaliers as they’re currently constituted because they have so many holes. Even if you buy James’s contention that his club’s focus isn’t nearly as shoddy as outsiders suggest, there’s no counter to the fact that the Cavaliers will wake up Monday in Manhattan for their maiden visit of the season to Madison Square Garden ranked last in the league in defensive efficiency (112 points allowed per 100 possessions).

The Cavs have foot-speed issues. They have continuity issues, in the wake of trading Kyrie Irving, with more new faces on the roster than returnees. They have injury issues, with the recent setbacks that have sidelined Tristan Thompson (calf) and Derrick Rose (ankle) — on top of the lingering hip trouble that has prevented Isaiah Thomas from logging a single second as James’s new All-Star sidekick.

“It’s real — we are having struggles on both ends of the floor,” Thomas said. “But I think it has a lot to do with, they’ve had a guy for the last three or four years — that guy’s been Kyrie — able to create off the dribble, get in the paint, get to the foul line. It’s hard to adjust to not having that, with me being injured as well and then having seven or eight new guys.

“All those little things, on top of little things, are what’s making us struggle right now. But it’s a process. It’s going to take time for everybody. We know, at the end of the day, everything will be all right.”

You can understand why Thomas is so presumptuous after watching James’s teams represent the Eastern Conference in seven successive N.B.A. finals. Even with the newcomers Jae Crowder and Dwyane Wade struggling to have an influence and the absence of a trusty rim protector, one nagging question in the East hasn’t changed: Who can actually exploit Cleveland’s frailties four times in a seven-game series?

The Irving-led Celtics have been the surprise of the season to date, reeling off 12 consecutive victories and surging to the top of the defensive charts in the wake of an 0-2 start and Gordon Hayward’s horrific leg injury. But who else is truly worthy of pre-Thanksgiving fawning? Would you really have the gumption to pick the Hayward-less Celtics over the Cavaliers in the East finals? It’s worth remembering that Cleveland sported the same 5-7 record after 12 games in 2014-15 — James’s first season back in northern Ohio, with Irving and Kevin Love as his wingmen — that it took onto the Mavericks’ floor on Saturday.

That team wound up pushing mighty Golden State to six games in the 2015 championship round despite the absence of the injured Love and the loss of Irving in the series opener.

“There has been a lot of turnover,” Cavaliers guard Kyle Korver said. “There has been a lot of lineup changes. There has been a lot of 'new.’ LeBron was hurt for the whole preseason, so the new guys didn’t really have a chance to play with him. There’s a lot of excuses if you want to go that route.

“But we’re still a confident team. We know what we’re capable of. We know pieces are going to keep coming in. Our team is going to evolve two or three more times over the course of the season — I think everyone here knows that.”

Scary thought. Maybe not as frightening as the way the Warriors are rolling — six wins in a row by at least 17 points to tie a league record — but sufficiently haunting for everyone else on Cleveland’s side of the conference divide.

For Dallas, meanwhile, its rare treat of two full practice days before LeBron’s annual visit to town did come with a downside. All that extra prep time forced Carlisle to field questions from pesky reporters about the Cavaliers’ bumpy launch on no fewer than four occasions.

Preoccupied with his own team’s 2-11 start, Carlisle made it clear through his words that he was ready to steer the conversation elsewhere by the third such interrogation.

“A lot of people would like to have their struggles,” he said of the Cavs.

Donald doesn’t back Ivana up then or afterward, but rather is displeased that she didn’t knuckle under: “Why didn’t you just have a friggin’ steak?” “Raising Trump” also provides a window into Donald’s pettiness when he pulls on Ivanka’s ski pole during a family race down the slope in order to win — cheating to beat his own young daughter!

Meet Marla Maples, the mistress Ivana refers to as “the showgirl.” Ivana divulges nothing of what was said in the heat of the ensuing battle with her husband back at the chalet, one of the many frustrating cloth-drops over the parrot cage in this book. The marital rupture inflicted a string of indignities on Ivana as the New York tabloids engaged in dueling headlines, the most infamous being Maples’s “Best Sex I Ever Had” boast on the front page of The Post. With her faint air of Zsa Zsa Gabor and madcap aplomb, Ivana aerated Trump’s persona during their marriage — gave his brash, crass excess a dash of dynasty dazzle and camp. Once their partnership was sundered, Ivana took her blithe esprit and comic malaprops to enjoy the high life elsewhere (“In 2006, my yacht was parked at Cannes for the film festival, and I was having a party with two hundred people on it”), a pity since she might have been a more inspiriting first lady than the inscrutable, animatronic Melania. As someone who grew up in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and witnessed Russian tanks crushing the Prague Spring, Ivana would have been more sensitive and perhaps even resistant to Russian interference than our current White House has been. Hurt and humiliated as she was by Donald’s infidelity, however, Ivana remains a loyalist, proclaiming, “I believe he’ll be a great president,” perhaps the first in a family dynasty. Of Ivanka, she suggests, “Who knows? One day, she might be the first female — and Jewish — POTUS.” I’vana throw up.

The subtitle to Jerry Oppenheimer’s “The Kardashians: An American Drama” evokes the panoramic scope and muted trumpets of a Ken Burns epic, but crack open the book and the whiff of cheese is unmistakable. It’s almost comforting knowing that we are in the able, busy hands of a veteran journeyman with few pretensions to subtlety, scene-painting and the stately march of history. The author of biographies of the Clintons, Rock Hudson, Anna Wintour, Martha Stewart, Barbara Walters and other two-legged notables, Oppenheimer doesn’t doodle around — he hacks away. The prologue kicks off with a classic bit of ooga-booga involving a Christian prophetess who told the then-obscure lawyer Robert Kardashian that, in his words, “one day my name, the Kardashian name, would be known around the world.” And, lo, the curse came to pass. On June 17, 1994, the day that the white Ford Bronco chase covered live from coast to coast entered American lore, Robert Kardashian — friend, legal defender and personal exculpator of the former football great and “Naked Gun” co-star O.J. Simpson — read aloud his client’s rambling letter of professed innocence concerning the slashing homicides of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman to a locust swarm of international press. He was identified on TV screens as “Robert Kardashian, Simpson Friend,” and from that moment the “Kardashian” name has become pop culture’s most persistent rash. Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob and their half sisters, Kendall and Kylie … all those freaking Kardashians, but the K who counts the most is, of course, Robert’s then-wife, Kris: Kristen Houghton Kardashian and the future Kris Jenner — schemer, dreamer, mother, impresario and “cougar extraordinaire.” It was she who would convert Kardashian from an instant household name into a self-perpetuating media brand and meme.

It can’t be said that Oppenheimer is in Kris’s corner as she bops her way to the top. Even as a high schooler she’s tagged as a “shallow opportunist,” and the chapter where the teenage Kris meets her first lover, a 28-year-old professional golfer, is titled “Hole in One.” Her marriage to Robert in 1978 would have been a parodic misalliance under balmier circumstances. For most readers, Ira Levin’s 1972 best-selling novel “The Stepford Wives” was a satire and cautionary tale; for the future Mrs. Kardashian, the 1975 thriller movie it inspired was a training manual. While dating Kris, Robert insisted that she listen to instructional audiocassettes to stock the bare pantry of her mind with knowledge, mistakenly assuming she would be an obedient helpmate. Unfortunately for this, Kris’s favorite mini-series was “The Thorn Birds,” that passion-tossed ’80s show about forbidden love in the kangaroo outback.

Despite these premarital misgivings, they wed and dutifully reproduced, but this Beverly Hills housewife was never going to relegate herself to hostess duty. Living large and spending big, Kris outfitted herself with fake boobs after seeing Nicole Simpson’s new pair (“I thought, I want two of those, please!”), and cheated on her husband with a young soccer player (“You can be a good mother and still be a tramp,” as one interested bystander puts it, words to live by). Divorce follows, and Robert Kardashian’s life becomes one sad, long, dribbling anticlimax. Basking in the celebrity glory of membership in O. J.’s dream team, after the shocking acquittal he found himself shunned, mocked and blackballed, and a couple of marriages later he died at age 59 from esophageal cancer. Meanwhile, Kris flourishes still, her subsequent union with the former Olympian Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn) supplying a second-stage booster rocket to the Kardashian brand.

Kim’s infamous sex tape with her then-boyfriend Ray J provided the initial liftoff. Modestly titled “Kim Kardashian, Superstar,” it surfaced in 2007, the same year that the reality series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” debuted on E!, executive-produced by the inescapable Ryan Seacrest and with Kris presiding as the “momager” of this ever-expanding family enterprise. One sympathizes with Oppenheimer as he tries to keep track of all these loose marbles, but his chronicle of the Kardashian Kids carries unpleasant racial overtones to which he appears tone-deaf. He mentions Khloe’s marriage to “the 6-foot-10 black pro basketball player Lamar Odom,” cites Kim’s divorce from Damon Thomas, “the first of her three African-American husbands,” and later circles back to Khloe, who “apparently had a real thing about romancing giant-size African-American hoop stars” (my agog italics). Composing himself, Oppenheimer covers the controversy over the Kardashians’ appropriation of black culture and iconography, as epitomized by Kim’s bare-backsided cover shot for Paper magazine (the one that “broke the internet”), but by then it’s too late in the book to be affecting a furrowed brow and going all Charlie Rose on us.

In the epilogue, Oppenheimer notes that all is not ducky in Kardashiana. The ratings for “Keeping Up” (now in its 14th season) are eroding and Kardashian mugs on the covers of slick magazines have become newsstand underperformers. During Fashion Week in 2016 Kim was robbed of $11 million-worth of jewelry by masked gunmen who broke into her Paris hotel suite and left her gagged — a crime that aroused suspicion that it was all a publicity stunt (it wasn’t, according to follow-up reports) and a hardy chorus of schadenfreude across social media. Oppenheimer floats the scenario that the wily Kris has one last shazam! act to pull: a daredevil leap for the biggest prize of all, the presidency. Citing Trump’s 2016 victory, he draws the obvious, dreary parallels between their reality-TV roots and social media reach, and explains that Kris and her family “have a big following among young African-American men, a bloc that eluded Trump, and have huge support among millennial women 18 to 34, and support in the transgender community — especially if Caitlyn, a staunch Republican, plays ball and stumps for her ex-wife if she, indeed, runs for elective office as she’s suggested.”

Please, stop. First Ivanka’s name is floated, now Kris’s, as if the most powerful office in the shrinking free world is a glorious bauble awarded after long devotion to celebrity, self-enrichment and the family brand, public service be damned. Why keep feeding their ravenous egos? Shouldn’t their brazen success be enough for them? It’d be nice if the first woman president were someone who’d actually done some good.","In ‘Raising Trump’ and ‘The Kardashians,’ Two Portraits of Modern American Matriarchy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review/the-kardashians-jerry-oppenheimer-raising-trump-ivana-trump.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Fortunately, he added, “Skipton is one of those places which is absolutely beautiful in the rain — as long as you are dressed appropriately.”

Simon Myers, a retired lawyer who serves on Craven District Council, recalled standing outside his home on a day when it was raining so hard that the hill opposite was invisible, then turning to his neighbor and saying, “Do remind me it’s the views that we live here for.”

Craven is an affluent pocket of the north, though not the richest place in the country. To Mr. Myers, that illustrates that wealth and happiness are not synonymous.

“I think it’s about being self-sufficient, valuing your communities, and doing your bit and mucking in together,” he said. “It isn’t because we can afford fancy cars.”

He showed no sign of leaving the race ahead of Alabama’s Dec. 12 special election date.

In an afternoon statement, Mr. Moore’s campaign described Ms. Allred as “a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle.” The statement, issued before Ms. Allred’s news conference in New York, denied again “any sexual misconduct with anyone” by Mr. Moore.

Republicans here and in Alabama have been up in arms over the accusations, published last week in The Washington Post, that Mr. Moore pursued sexual or romantic relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The reports have upended a race in a state that has not elected a Democratic senator in 25 years.

In a fund-raising appeal, Mr. Moore reached out to his supporters with the subject line: “Mitch McConnell’s plot to destroy me.”

“Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment G.O.P. would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian,” he wrote.

And Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, lashed out in a Facebook post on Monday, complaining about “a witch hunt” in Alabama and claiming that “we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward.”

“Washington establishment and Democrat Party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign,” she wrote. “Prayers appreciated.....”

But with Mr. McConnell now firmly against his election, Mr. Moore and his candidacy promise to deepen the divide between Republican leaders in Congress and the populist wing of the party that is standing by the Alabamian. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also called for Mr. Moore to drop out of the race on Monday.

Anxious Republican officials spent much of the weekend trying to determine what, if anything, they could do to halt Mr. Moore without simply turning over the seat. If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat.

But if Mr. Moore stays in and goes on to win, it could leave Senate Republicans with the difficult question of whether to stop him from being seated or seating him and immediately moving to expel him from the chamber.

One idea now being discussed under this scenario, brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, would be for Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama to immediately appoint Attorney General Jeff Sessions to what had been his seat when it becomes vacant again. Mr. Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with President Trump has waned since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s campaign.

Republicans in Washington, though, have not ruled out fielding a write-in candidate and some of the party’s outside groups were expected to conduct surveys this week of who would be most formidable prospect, according to officials familiar with the plans.

Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, said that if additional women like the one joining Ms. Allred tell their stories, it would undermine Mr. Moore’s case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article.

“The more people that come out of the woodwork, the more women with similar stories, the more credible it becomes,” said Zac McCrary, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster. “It’s going to become easier to see through Roy Moore’s non-denial denials.”

Ms. Nelson said that instead of driving her home, Mr. Moore drove to the back of the restaurant, parked his vehicle and forced himself on her.

Soon after Harvey Weinstein was first outed as a sexual predator, I created a document titled “Creeps” in which I tried to list every man who had sexually harassed or assaulted me. It’s a companion to the running inventory that I keep in my head of the male filmmakers, in Hollywood and out, whose work degrades or disdains women. This is another kind of cinematic canon, one that includes directors I loathe and those I otherwise sometimes admire, however reluctantly. I imagine that a lot of women who love movies even when the movies don’t love us back have their own such lists.

One fallacy about criticism is that it can be practiced objectively, as if we could see and write about movies from some sort of out-of-body experience. As if it were possible for me to watch a movie in which women are abused for no apparent reason — without even a pretense of narrative rationale — and view this exploitation as simply another formal attribute, like the cinematography, soundtrack or superb camerawork. I’ve watched a lot of movies with really excellent camerawork from male directors who treat women onscreen like garbage. And then there’s the peculiar and ugly case of Louis C.K., whose forthcoming movie, “I Love You, Daddy,” was recently yanked by its distributor.

Louis C.K. is of course only the latest powerful man to be accused of what is politely called sexual misconduct, in his case masturbating in front of appalled women. On Friday, he admitted in a statement that “these stories are true,” closing with a pledge that I hope is widely heeded: “I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want. I will now step back and take a long time to listen.” I don’t feel bad for him or mourn a career that may be over. He’s rich and can crawl into a cushy hole, where he should follow his own advice and listen, namely to women who have been silenced by men who are free to say — and do — what they want.

This freedom is at the center of “I Love You, Daddy,” which now serves as the last will and testament for at least Louis C.K.’s career to date. I first saw the movie in September at the Toronto International Film Festival. As a catalog of male pathology, it made me laugh, at times uncomfortably, but part of its power was that it also seemed confessional. The history of cinema is also a history of the exploitation of women, and here was a male director seemingly grappling with this. As I wrote then : “Cinema has long served as a vehicle for male onanism, a space in which male fantasies about sexual power over women are expressed on screen and enacted behind the camera.”

“I Love You, Daddy” is a compendium of such male fantasies. It centers on a successful television director, Glen (Louis C.K.), in the midst of myriad crises. He’s incapable of parenting his 17-year-old daughter, China (Chloë Grace Moretz), and caves to her every wish. (“Can I take the jet?”) He’s similarly thwarted at work. He’s signed up to create a new TV show but is creatively stuck, to the exasperation of his producing partner, Paula (Edie Falco). Meanwhile, he has fired one actress and hired another, Grace (Rose Byrne), and they start sleeping together. She introduces Glen to his idol, a pompous, 68-year-old filmmaker named Leslie (John Malkovich), who, as someone says, “likes young girls.”

A lot happens in the movie, which repeatedly circles back to the question of whether it’s possible to separate the artist from the art, a question that some are asking now of Louis C.K. For Glen, this takes on extra urgency when China begins an undefined relationship with Leslie, who showers her with attention, shopping with her and sweeping her off to Paris. The first time they talk at length, Leslie even defines radical feminism for China, a scene that mirrors another in which Glen delivers a more generalized feminist lesson. Men explaining equality to a young woman is one provocation; another is that Grace defends sexual relations between teenage girls and adult men.

The other sustained provocation is that “I Love You, Daddy” is partly about the Woody Allen Problem. The film’s black-and-white cinematography is an obvious reference to Mr. Allen’s oft-celebrated 1979 film “Manhattan,” in which he plays a comedy writer having an affair with a 17-year-old girl. The title “I Love You, Daddy” refers to China’s repeated declaration to Glen, but it also seems like a nod at Mr. Allen’s expansive influence on comedy. Louis C.K. himself has been compared to Mr. Allen and he appeared in Mr. Allen’s 2013 drama “ Blue Jasmine .” “He’s a very big deal in my life,” Louis C.K. said of being cast in that movie. “Since I was a little kid, I loved Woody Allen.”

Has that love soured? Did it sour in 2014, when Mr. Allen was accused by his daughter, Dylan Farrow, of sexually molesting her ? However starkly confessional “I Love You, Daddy” sometimes registers as, it can also be seen as an act of symbolic patricide, a way of addressing a tarnished idol. Shortly before it ends, China turns 18 and offers herself to Leslie, who for the first time seems uninterested in her. Perhaps that’s meant to suggest that he doesn’t actually seduce girls or that China, at 18, is now too old for him. Your interpretation may vary, though it’s worth noting that Leslie later enthuses about how wonderful it is to be “loved by a girl and then be rejected by the woman she becomes.”

The line reminds me of one that Mr. Allen’s character, Isaac, tells the now 18-year-old former girlfriend , Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), toward the end of “ Manhattan ”: “I just don’t want that thing I like about you to change.” It’s unclear what he means (her beauty, her youth), though earlier Isaac tells Tracy — after passionately kissing her while they’re out one night in a horse-drawn carriage — that she’s “God’s answer to Job” and “would have ended all argument between them.” God, Isaac says while pointing a finger at Tracy, would have said, “I do a lot of terrible things, but I can also make one of these .”

I was 18 when I saw “Manhattan” and I despised it because I knew that its reveries were built on a lie that few adults, including film critics, seemed willing to acknowledge. Perhaps that’s partly why I appreciated “I Love You, Daddy” the first time I saw it. Louis C.K. seemed to be pointing at Mr. Allen with a queasy homage that was getting at the truth of “Manhattan” even as “I Love You, Daddy” circled — and circled — its own creator’s complicity in female exploitation. The two ideas converge late in the film when Glen meets Leslie, who reveals that he hasn’t seen China in a long time. That’s when Leslie dreamily shares his philosophy about loving girls only to be rejected by the women they become.

It’s an unnerving scene, one that doubtless speaks to how some men view women, but it also speaks, I think, to how the movies see women. How they use and use up young women, at least until they turn 18 or 20 or so when some moviemaker or some suit deems her no longer desirable and turns her putative lack of desirability on her, as if she were responsible for this lack of interest in her. When I watched “I Love You, Daddy” a second time, the jokes no longer landed; its shocks felt uglier, cruder. But for once a filmmaker seemed to be admitting to the misogyny that we know is always there and has often been denied or simply waved off, at times in the name of art.

The revelations about Louis C.K. and others are killing any pretense that any of this is objective. It’s very personal, and it always has been.

“For Trump supporters reflexively jumping to Moore’s defense, please stop making stupid arguments. You are hurting the president.”

Mr. Jennings, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has a novel idea for how President Trump should respond to allegations against Roy S. Moore. The president should encourage the Alabama Republican party to withdraw Mr. Moore’s name from the slot, and urge voters to write in Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the position he left behind.

Mr. Harsanyi has a healthy dose of skepticism about the mainstream media, writing that “the establishment media gave former presidents and senators who were likely sexual predators virtual free passes for decades.” But that doesn’t dissuade him from considering The Washington Post’s article chronicling Mr. Moore’s alleged relationships with teenagers to be a “credible” and “solid piece of journalism.” It is fair, argues Mr. Harsanyi, to support Mr. Moore based on policy — like his views on abortion — despite these accusations. “But don’t tell me you’re sure Roy Moore is innocent.” Read more »

David French in National Review:



“Roy Moore will not lose his life, liberty, or property if voters reject his bid for high office.”

Mr. French reminds his readers that “Constitutional protections for due process apply when the state is attempting to deprive a person of ‘life, liberty, or property.’ ” It does not apply when you are at risk of being deprived of a seat in government. Just as it is “entirely fair for voters to analyze the available facts about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal [...] without waiting for the outcome of a civil or criminal proceeding,” so is it entirely fair to voters to assess Mr. Moore’s character based on reports in The Washington Post. People who know better, he writes, are disingenuously calling for due process, knowing full well that “it’s a good way to coax good people into ignoring problematic claims while soothing their guilty conscience.” Read more »

Kathryn Brightbill in Los Angeles Times:



“The allegations against Roy Moore are merely a symptom of a larger problem. It’s not a Southern problem or an Alabama problem. It’s a Christian fundamentalist problem.”

Ms. Brightbill, who grew up as an evangelical Christian, explains why so many on the religious right are excusing Mr. Moore’s relationship with teenage girls. In the world “which Moore travels in and I grew up in, 14-year-old girls courting adult men isn’t uncommon,” she writes. This story, according to Ms. Brightbill, just signals how pervasive child sexual abuse is in this community. “The evangelical world is overdue for a reckoning.” Read more »",Right and Left React to the Allegations of Sexual Misconduct Against Roy Moore,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/right-left-roy-moore.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

But while the sharpest memories of the attacks may be receding for some, much daily life in Paris remains marked by reminders of the threat of terrorism.

Many of the attackers had traveled to Syria or Iraq before returning to France, where they and others presented an essentially homegrown security threat, however manipulated or inspired from abroad.

The Interior Ministry still describes the threat of terrorist attacks as extremely high, and police patrols in Paris are far more routine than before. Many tourist attractions are guarded by heavily armed officers, and 7,000 soldiers have been deployed across France to sites that the government believes may be targets for attack.

Even so, the attempted attacks have shown no sign of abating. So far this year, 13 attacks have been stopped, according to the Interior Minister Gérard Collomb, including one which involved conspirators in France and Switzerland.

Despite those successes, three people were killed by terrorists in France in 2017: two civilians in Marseille and one police officer patrolling on the Champs-Élysées.

The attempted attacks have gone on despite a two-year state of emergency that gave the police extraordinary powers to detain people even if there was not enough evidence to charge them.

The state of emergency ended on Nov. 1, but only after the National Assembly approved legislation in October that enshrined many of its provisions into law.

In 2016, the French Parliament had approved another sweeping law that allows the police and prosecutors to use electronic eavesdropping technology previously limited to the intelligence services, including hidden cameras and access to electronic data.

In an interview this past weekend with The Journal du Dimanche, Mr. Collomb, the interior minister, said that France was better armed today to counter terrorists than it had been in 2015.

But, he said, the threat had changed from a large network closely directed by the Islamic State to “little groups here and there in our country, who have plans to carry out violence but do not have links with each other.”

While the would-be attackers are less centrally organized than the large network that carried out the attacks in and around Paris in 2015 and in Belgium in 2016, they are “also harder to detect,” Mr. Collomb said.

One source of relief, he noted, was that fewer French citizens who had gone to fight with the Islamic State in Syria have returned than was initially anticipated, he said.

According to the ministry’s estimates, 1,700 French citizens went to the Iraqi-Syrian areas controlled by the Islamic State since the beginning of the fighting there in 2012.

Of those, 281 are presumed to be dead, and 302 have returned.

One afternoon in Florida, a 59-year-old career truck driver named Jeff Runions sat alertly in the cab of an 18-wheeler watching the road while his 11-ton cargo of stone tile made its way up the Ronald Reagan Turnpike. He was watching his steering wheel, too, but his hands were at his side: A computer was in control.

Mr. Runions works for Starsky Robotics, a San Francisco start-up that for the past two years has been testing its self-driving technology by running freight up and down Florida. The runs help collect data and hone the technology, in hopes of convincing regulators and the company itself that self-driving trucks are ready for business.

There are still plenty of kinks. Sitting next to Mr. Runions was an Irish engineer named Rebecca Feeney Barry. As the vehicle spent hours driving past swamps and billboards for accident lawyers, Ms. Feeney Barry balanced a laptop on her knees and watched how the truck’s sensors interpreted the road and nearby cars.

At one point the computer’s “vision” briefly lost sight of the freeway because an overpass shaded the road. Later, the truck didn’t take a turn hard enough, prompting Mr. Runions to grab the wheel. Ms. Feeney Barry logged all of it. Later, after some computer code had been altered to tell the truck to tug the wheel a bit harder, it made a similar turn more smoothly.

“Sometimes it kind of messes me up when I go back to driving because now I’m used to the truck driving,” Mr. Runions said.

Starsky’s ultimate plan, of course, is to eliminate Mr. Runions’s job. But they do not want him to be out of one. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, Starsky’s 27-year-old chief executive, foresees using self-driving technology to replace long-haul drivers on freeways, but having people like Mr. Runions navigate at either end of the trip with remote control consoles that look like an arcade racing game.

Drivers would go off to work in offices and might spend their day driving trucks through the last few miles of several different routes in several different cities before heading home for dinner.

“One driver can drive 10 to 30 trucks per day,” Mr. Seltz-Axmacher said.

The March of Automation

Starsky’s vision of a remote operation is unique. But the basic idea — having trucks drive themselves on highways and letting human drivers take over in complicated city environments — is something of an industry consensus.

“One of the big misconceptions about self-driving technology is that it is going to emerge and be able to drive all the time in all circumstances,” said Alden Woodrow, the product manager for Uber’s self-driving truck unit.

As part of their partnership, Embark, Ryder and Electrolux are conducting what amounts to elaborate dry runs to imagine what self-driving-truck routes will look like. The runs start with human drivers leaving an Electrolux warehouse in El Paso and driving to the edge of the city, where they hitch the trailer to one of Embark’s autonomous trucks.

From there the truck drives itself for 650 highway miles (with a safety driver in tow) to Ontario, Calif., where the Embark drivers transfer their trailer to another Ryder driver, who drives the final few miles to one of Electrolux’s California warehouses.

“It’s a mirror of what we would do if there weren’t a driver inside,” said Mr. Rodrigues, the Embark chief.

A few miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., a company called Peloton Technology is betting that there is a business to be built in a less radical version of automation. Peloton is on the cusp of rolling out a system that will make it easier and safer for trucks to travel one after the other on the highway, in a formation called platooning, helping them save gas by reducing wind drag.

Trucks with drivers already do this. But Peloton’s technology aims to make platooning safer with a mix of cameras, sensors and networking equipment, allowing the trucks to talk to each other and helping to prevent the second driver from ramming into the first truck after a sudden stop.

Josh Switkes, the company’s chief executive, said that because Peloton’s technology helps drivers get better at doing something they are familiar with, he thinks it can be quickly commercialized.

“Our basic approach is let’s bring real value to the fleet and society now,” Mr. Switkes said.",Self-Driving Trucks May Be Closer Than They Appear,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/self-driving-trucks.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said.
Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said.
“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.
Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters.","Nick Haynes didn’t seem so bad.

Sure, online he had promised civil war if Hillary Clinton were elected, but Mr. Haynes was first and foremost a family man. He’d given up his days of motorcycles and drinking to live a sober life in a sleepy Pennsylvania town with his four children, where he had a full-time job as a truck driver.

But his family life contrasted sharply with his other full-time job, that of a prolific online commenter. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he tweeted an average of 57 times a day about a corrupt system, biased media and “Killary.” He compared voting for Mrs. Clinton to killing your own children.

It was this disconnect between “normal life” and intense online debate that drove Kyrre Lien, a photographer based in Oslo, to look into the lives of the online commenting community. For a project called “The Internet Warriors,” Mr. Lien combed through tens of thousands of online comments to put together a group of 27 internet debaters from around the world, representing all sides of the political spectrum.

“They had steady jobs, they had family, they had friends and lived quite a normal life, but at the same time, you saw they had these hateful comments,” he said. “That was part of what drove me to dig into this.”

In the case of Mr. Haynes, Mr. Lien assumed that he would personify his comments.

“I thought if you’re writing hateful comment towards Hillary or Trump that are really, really angry and horrible, I thought that person is going to be horrible in person as well,” Mr. Lien said. “But many of the people were actually quite nice, made me coffee and tea and, until politics came up, it was like flipping the switch on a different personality.”

Still, Mr. Lien is hesitant to categorize them as internet trolls.

“Labeling them all as internet trolls would be too harsh. Many of them are trolls, but many of them are just really strongly opinionated people,” Mr. Lien said. “All of the people I met are really dedicated in the cause they’re fighting.”

They have full-time jobs and families, they are men and women of all ages, who feel marginalized in some way or another. Take, for example, Ashleigh Jones, 22, a psychology student in Cardiff, Wales. She’s amassed more than 180,000 tweets on various subjects including entertainment, L.G.B.T. issues and “hot guys.”

“Some people have also called me a troll, like when I said that ISIS should kill David Cameron,” Ms. Jones told Mr. Lien, referring to the former British prime minister. “I don’t think I’m a troll. I might have strong opinions, but they are just that — opinions. For me, a troll is someone who is ruining the discussion, and that’s not me.”

The photographs feature portraits of the commenters, many of them in their natural commenting habitat inside their homes. Video interviews accompany the subjects online, as well as a book.

“Just to see their homes, their decorations around them, their computers — all of those things give quite a lot of personality to the photo,” Mr. Lien said.

Mr. Lien spent weeks researching and studying commenters. One thread took him down a dark path on Kim Kardashian’s Facebook account. He spent three or four days going through all the comments on her account looking for frequent commenters with a consistent message. But in the end, that was one type of opinion he wasn’t able to capture on camera — misogynists.

Mr. Lien found that the motivation behind commenters depends on their political affiliation. On the right, it’s “because they feel threatened and society is letting them down, they’re being left by themselves,” Mr. Lien said, whereas people on the left “feel that we need to stand up for what we believe in.”

Sofia Srour, 23 and Muslim, defends her religion daily.

“There is so much ignorance and hate directed towards my religion in the comment section that I quickly become irritated. Anger drives me,” she told Mr. Lien. “I have spent more than three hours every day sharing my views on Islam. It’s a bit scary to engage in these discussions, but I feel that it’s important to balance out all the negativity that is posted.”

Mr. Lien may have spent four years trailing the lives of what he calls internet warriors, but the photographer is far from calling himself a troll.

“I’d like to be more of an internet peacekeeping force than an internet warrior,” he said.

To uncork the mystery of the oldest wine, Dr. McGovern and his team searched the remains of two villages from the Neolithic era — or the last part of the Stone Age — about 30 miles south of the capital Tbilisi. Clay vessels found at these Neolithic sites and others in Georgia suggest the people most likely stored their wine in large, round jars as big as 300 liters, enough to hold about 400 bottles. They also probably buried them underground to ferment, which is still practiced in Georgia to this day.

The team retrieved several jar shards from the sites, which they then chemically analyzed. To their surprise, eight had telltale signs of wine residue long absorbed into the pottery, including tartaric acid, which is like a flashing neon light indicating traces of grape, as well as malic, succinic and citric acids. Dr. McGovern said that to his knowledge, the combination of these four acids is only found in grape wine.

Radiocarbon dating of the site dated jar shards to the years 6,000 to 5,800 B.C. The team also found traces of ancient grape pollen, starch from grape wine and remains from Neolithic fruit flies. They did not find any DNA or pigments on the residue so they could not say whether it was red or white wine.

More Reporting on Archaeology

Although it is possible these prehistoric people were just making grape juice, Stephen Batiuk, an archaeologist from the University of Toronto and an author on the study, said the decorations on the jars implied they were used to store something important, like wine.

Robert Desalle, a molecular biologist at the American Museum of Natural History and co-author of the book “A Natural History of Wine,” called the study “airtight,” adding that the findings will prompt him to rewrite the chapter in his book about the oldest site for winemaking.

Andrew Waterhouse, a wine chemist at the University of California, Davis, agreed, saying that finding succinic acid indicated that fermentation had taken place.

But he suggested that humanity’s love affair with wine most likely extended deeper into the archaeological record. The animal hides probably used by even earlier prehistoric peoples who fermented grapes into wine most likely decayed over thousands of years, so pottery remains our best bet for discovering how humanity first got buzzed.","Wine From Prehistoric Georgia With an 8,000-Year-Old Vintage",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/science/georgia-oldest-wine.html

He would often trek to “the City” to buy fireworks in Chinatown or learn from the hustlers at pool halls. After one adventure gone wrong, his father took him to the Lower East Side to show him the doomed future he was facing, lecturing him on how he had all these things that these latter-day Bowery Boys did not have.

“All I remember is I wanted to get out of the car and play stickball with these kids,” he said. “That was the lesson I learned.”

That spirit of adventure informs “The Eyes of the City,” a book and exhibit of the same name that is currently at the Leica store in New York. Out on the streets or underground on the subway, Mr. Sandler finds moments where composition and subject meld in a way that goes beyond nostalgia, or challenges notions about a broken city.

The city he chronicled between 1977 and 2001 explored neighborhoods that held steady when the city’s future looked grim. Over that period, his work became more political — as in the 1982 photo of four black nannies pushing white toddlers in strollers. But there is also a crazy, funny beauty too, which is no accident.

“Part of why people look at my work is for nostalgia,” he said. “But the subject matter is timeless. Yeah, the backdrop was a different city, but at the same time it was a functioning place. I’d argue it was a better place than now.”

But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments.","When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order.

But the N.F.L. installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals.

The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men. But as a result, the players now accuse the nation’s richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all.

“Players will be shorted what they earned,” said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinson’s disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing. “This is not a settlement. This is about paying sick men as little as possible.”

Stewart, who was in the league from 1989-93 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinson’s diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L. benefit plans. But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.

Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, planned to meet with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs’ chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently.

“Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up,” said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the league’s legal cases. “Unfortunately, the N.F.L. has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.”

Orrin Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise. He said that players are now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement.

He said the bulk of the claims that have been sent back to players were for missing paperwork. But another group of claims have been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined.

Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion. But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.

“It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork,” Brown said. “But there’s nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this. The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.”

The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each — though most will likely receive far less — for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field. A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they can submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously.

Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had “growing pains” because of unanticipated problems. In this case, some former players have “pushed the envelope,” he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records.

By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address “some funny things that didn’t look right,” and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Seeger said.

Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L. of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.

“Is this working perfectly? No,” Seeger said. But “if there aren’t sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem. The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion. Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.”

Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation. The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts.

“I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics,” said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players. “There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims. Basically, they’re saying you need to start all over again, even if you have a pre-existing diagnosis” recognized by an N.F.L. benefit plan.

All 35 claims Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of “deficiencies,” he said. Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited.

Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L. players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies.

“The settlement was sold by the N.F.L. and Seeger as quick pay,” Luckasevic said. “This was something everyone feared. This is the N.F.L. disability plan version 2.0.”

The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it denies that stricter requirements were added after the deal was made final.

“There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized,” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims.

The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L. under one of it regular disability plans. The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral.

Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L. will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits.

Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable. He was found to have Parkinson’s disease in 2009, when he was 43.

Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement. But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.

The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football.

After Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis. But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four.

In the settlement, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award. But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then.

Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career. But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing — often with the aid of painkillers — so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day.

In many ways, the N.F.L. case is different from many settlements, experts said. Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt. In the N.F.L. settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S.

Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players’ lawyers — many of whom receive a percentage any settlement — have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L. to be alert to fraud, experts said.

Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million. But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments. In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L. insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims.

But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud.

Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he has handled, defendants have a right to try to prevent fraud. But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlement.

“It’s not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door,” said Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L. case. “All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.”",Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/sports/football/nfl-concussion-lawsuit.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

It was not clear whether that was a good thing or a bad one.

On the contrary, Ms. Smith offered a kinder, gentler view of movie stars and moguls, politicians and society figures. And gossip was hardly the only ingredient of her columns: They were sprinkled with notes on books or films, bits of political commentary and opinions about actors, authors and other notables.

She often inserted herself into stories. Explaining why Madonna had become a regular in her columns, Ms. Smith wrote in 2006, “I didn’t always agree with what she said, or what she did, but the hysterical overreaction to her caused me, if not to defend her, then at least to put a more balanced perspective on her astonishing ongoing saga.”

If her columns lacked edge, they provided something more: the insider’s view. Many of those she wrote about became her friends, people she genuinely liked and who liked her. She lunched with them, partied with them, vacationed with them and shared their successes and travails. And they trusted her, knowing she would not trash them in print.

But journalism’s watchdogs accused her, with some justification, of conflicts of interest, of lacking objectivity and distance from those she wrote about. The Village Voice, Spy magazine and other publications made her the butt of satires, portraying her as an egocentric, mistake-prone partisan, using columns to promote her friends.

Mary Elizabeth Smith was born in Fort Worth on Feb. 2, 1923, the daughter of Sloan and Sarah McCall Smith. Her father was a cotton broker whose gambling problems and fading income during the Great Depression forced the family to sell their home and move. Her parents paid bribes to keep her in her old school, but it left her a painfully shy outsider.

“I grew up with all these little rich kids,” she recalled. “I didn’t have a dime. I couldn’t face that. I was always a horrible little social climber in my way.”

Movies provided an escape. She adored Tom Mix, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire and dreamed of a career somewhere in the orbit of stars.

After high school, she attended Hardin-Simmons University, a Baptist-affiliated college in Abilene, Tex., and met George E. Beeman, whom she married and later divorced.

She leaves no immediate survivors.

Ms. Smith studied journalism at the University of Texas and, after graduating, moved to New York in 1949. She took a series of jobs — at Modern Screen magazine, at Newsweek and as an assistant to Kaye Ballard, the actress and singer. In 1953 Ms. Ballard took her on a national tour with the Broadway company of “Top Banana,” a musical comedy that starred Phil Silvers. Back in New York, she worked for Mike Wallace at CBS Radio and Dave Garroway’s “Wide Wide World” on NBC-TV.

In 1959, Igor Cassini, who wrote the Cholly Knickerbocker gossip column for The New York Journal-American, hired her to interview celebrities at nightclubs and to write the column during his vacations. In the 1960s, she was married for several years to Fred Lister, a travel agent. They had no children, and that marriage also ended in divorce.

Ms. Smith developed ideas for Allen Funt’s television show “Candid Camera”; wrote for Ladies’ Home Journal, Vogue, Sports Illustrated and other magazines; and was entertainment editor of Cosmopolitan. Besides her columns for The Daily News, Newsday and The New York Post, she worked for many years as a commentator for WNBC-TV in New York as well as for the local Fox channel and E! Entertainment Television.

Long before her “Liz Smith” column ended in The Post in February 2009 — after being cut to three times a week in 2008 — newsprint gossip columns had been migrating to the internet and its ever-expanding blogosphere, an ideal format for rapier thrusts at celebrities, often delivered anonymously and with little regard for truth or consequences.

Ms. Smith was also a founder and former part owner of the website wowOwow.com, aimed at women 40 and older. And she still had plenty else to do, writing for news syndication, Daily Variety and Parade magazine, a Sunday supplement in hundreds of newspapers. In 2005, she published a book of reminiscences and recipes, “Dishing: Great Dish — and Dishes — From America’s Most Beloved Gossip Columnist,” a serving of celebrities garnished with favorite foods.

Her 2000 memoir, “Natural Blonde,” a best seller for months, was a breezy compendium of tales about Rock Hudson, Richard Burton, Joe DiMaggio, Sean Connery, Frank Sinatra, Katharine Hepburn and others — nothing very scandalous.

The oppressively hot afternoons in the Delta and the cool, quiet country nights of the rural woodlands inspired many of the greatest American storytellers, including William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty and Shelby Foote, and the blues musicians Robert Johnson and Son House.

This year, to honor the bicentennial of Mississippi’s statehood, residents throughout the state are following that tradition, telling the stories of their own communities with photographs employing the 21st-century technology of smartphones. The project, “Celebrating Storytellers,” was created by Chandler Griffin and Alison Fast, partners in Blue Magnolia Films and Barefoot Workshops, and will culminate next month with an exhibit of 200 five-foot-wide images in storefront windows in Jackson, Miss. Similar exhibits have already been held in five other cities.

“We didn’t want to just have big parties for the bicentennial with nothing that’s lasting afterwards,” Mr. Griffin said. “We really wanted to engage with communities. We wanted to go from town to town, and create spaces where people could have conversation about their community and what revitalization means.”

He and Ms. Fast went to a dozen towns and cities in Mississippi asking community leaders to help identify people who understood the fabric of their communities and invited them to a free, weeklong workshop and to begin documenting where they live with iPhones. The stories were chosen by the participants, who received guidance from the workshop team that included Aaron Phillips, a photographer who started out as a student at the Barefoot Workshops, and Natalie Irby, the executive producer.

There will be 100 participants in all ranging in age from 14 to 91.

In Mound Bayou, a small economically-depressed Delta city that was founded by former slaves in 1887, Myrna Smith-Thompson documented the rundown home of Isaiah Montgomery, a former slave of Jefferson Davis, who helped found the community. Ms. Smith-Thompson, who was born and raised in Mound Bayou, leads the Knights of Tabor, a benevolent community organization that is restoring local historic sites. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather led the organization before her.

“It’s not just a house,” she wrote for the project. “It’s the home of a man who in 1887 had a dream of turning a swampy piece of land filled with wild animals and mosquitoes and unimaginable obstacles into a negro self-governing community in Mississippi, for the people. He had the audacity to ask newly freed slaves to clear this land and make a nice place to live with all the amenities afforded to others. He had the nerve to attempt to influence free slaves to become self sufficient to create a safe haven for blacks amidst a climate of fear and hostility.”

At the start of the project last year, the emphasis was on Mississippi’s revitalization, not “race and reconciliation,” Mr. Griffin said. But the subject came up in every single workshop they held. In Clarksdale, an group of high school students from the mostly-black public school and an almost all-white private school made race the focus of their projects. Before meeting at the workshop they had rarely mixed, but they got together afterward for dinners and attended each other’s graduations. These experiences, Mr. Griffin said, “lead to change in communities.”

Mr. Griffin is a fifth-generation Mississippian, and attended Jackson Prep, a private institution that was started as a segregated school in 1970 in response to the federally mandated integration of the public schools. When he graduated in year 1994 he felt like he “had blinders on and was not exposed to anything.”

He attended art school in Savannah, Ga. and taught photography at the Maine Workshop in Rockport, M.E. before moving to New York City to “make his mark.” He rarely told anyone he was from Mississippi.

After a while, he realized that he didn’t really know Mississippi outside of where he grew up, so he returned to start Barefoot Workshops in Clarksdale and to learn more about his home.

“I fell in love with Mississippi in 2005 when I ran that first workshop, and ever since then I’ve just been trying to figure out ways to help tell the story and talk about the awesome things in Mississippi, as well as the problems, and look at the people working on solutions.”

Looking back at the experience, Ms. Smith-Thompson said the project taught her “to see things differently and how to tell stories with pictures” and made her “feel like a younger person.” For Christmas, she is buying a new iPhone to continue documenting her community.

“Storytelling helps us to share our different perspectives of our community with someone else, in a non-threatening way,” she explained. “The harsher the situation, the more impactful storytelling may be.”

The biannual fashion weeks hosted in New York, London, Milan and Paris have dominated the industry calendar for decades. In recent years, however, a clutch of new contenders have emerged, including Dubai, where Arab Fashion Week begins tomorrow.

The five-day event is a predictably glitzy affair, showcasing talent from the 22 countries that make up the Arab League. Plenty of emerging Western designers are also on the schedule, keen to cater to the valuable Middle Eastern client base. Above, Saudi designer Sadeem Alshehail, background, after her fashion show in Dubai last month.

Expect a broad mix of both Western-style ready-to-wear and modest clothing from the catwalk collections. As a growing global chorus of women demands attire that is in tune both with Islam and the societies around them, designers are responding with flowing printed tunics and colorful head scarves. Interestingly, designers from abroad are often the more conservative.

Modest fashion is becoming a commercial phenomenon. The global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $368 billion by 2021, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report. With its blend of trends from all over the world, Arab Fashion Week is playing a considerable role in reshaping perceptions of 21st-century Muslim female identity in ways that go far beyond the veil.

In the not-too-distant future, a traveler’s face will replace a boarding pass, and recognition software will replace the gate agent scanning each traveler’s ticket. Airline executives separated by distance will be able to use virtual reality eyewear to walk together through an airplane cabin and solve design problems.

In this same future, autonomous vehicles could help passengers check in and airplanes push back.

The future is now as the aviation industry embraces new technology as enthusiastically as it does jumbo jets packed with well-behaved, premium-fare paying passengers.

According to a 2017 survey by the International Air Transport Association, air travelers are just as excited about this modernization. About three quarters of those interviewed by the association expect to be able to check their bag in three minutes (78 percent), pass through immigration in 10 minutes (74 percent) and browse the internet in flight (73 percent).

Another industry study reports that airlines and airports are consistently spending money to make technological advances happen because it is critical to meet ever-higher demands from passengers.

“They’ve got expectations from shopping on Amazon,” said Jim Peters, chief technology officer for the airline-owned technology company SITA. “They get information when they want it. They collaborate with friends and they expect that will be a natural way for them to be interacting as they travel.”

Virtual Reality

One of the newest developments in aviation evolved from consumer video games. As the visual product improved, virtual reality products using fine-tuned, realistic 3-D environments were incorporated for design, training and marketing in the air travel industry.

In a computer lab in Winston-Salem, N.C., interior systems designers at Rockwell Collins use virtual reality to test the airline cabins they create, inviting customers to sit in seats, open overhead bins and tug rolling suitcases down the aisle. This allows them to discover and fix mistakes before the design is finalized.

It would take “crazy-man money” to actually build a prototype and inspect it this way, said David Balfour, a visualization specialist with the company. Virtual reality allows airlines to “put a virtual-reality headset on and stand up and view an entire cabin.”

In the virtual-reality environment, to err is actually a good thing, said Glenn Johnson, director of the design studio at Rockwell Collins.

Designs “fail quicker and cheaper,” he said, which means improvements can come faster.

This ability to create large and complex environments also makes virtual reality promising for training airfield staff members who work in hazardous environments, servicing airliners in all kinds of weather and light conditions.

With RampVR , a program developed by the I.A.T.A., students wear goggles and identify problems as they virtually inspect an airplane and the ramp area around it. Experiential training sticks in the mind, according to Frederic Leger, airport passenger cargo and security product director for the association.

“You are living the training because you are active in the training,” Mr. Leger said. “It’s like a game where you have a score at the end, so it goes to the emotional part of your brain.”

Considering that airline pilots do recurrent training in a simulator on a regular basis, bringing a simulated setting to other areas of the industry is not a new concept. It is only recently, however, that the improved quality and lower cost of virtual reality have made its widespread use practical.

With all the showy advantages of virtual reality, some airlines are trying to turn the “wow” into revenue. At a pop-up cafe in London earlier this month, Air Canada invited visitors to watch a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight in virtual reality. The German airline Lufthansa prepared a 360 video of the interior of its long-haul aircraft, and its employees presented viewing goggles to ticketed passengers waiting at boarding gates in Newark and Frankfurt last year. After watching the show, Lufthansa, asked if they wanted to purchase an upgrade to a premium economy seat.

“How can you communicate a travel product? This is the problem in the industry,” said Torsten Wingenter, Lufthansa’s senior director of digital innovations. Virtual reality gave the company the “first chance to show the product in an emotional way.”

After the test, the emotion at the airline can be described as happy. A number of economy passengers paid $299 more to fly in premium economy after viewing the cabin in virtual reality. Mr. Wingenter would not say how many, but that it was “a significant number.”

Biometric Boarding

In December, Lufthansa passengers flying out of Los Angeles will be able to use what JetBlue customers in Boston are already using — boarding gates that let passengers onto the airplane with no paper ticket or electronic boarding pass, just a face that matches their passport photo.

On two JetBlue routes, from Boston to Aruba and the Dominican Republic, passengers stand in front of a camera that takes their picture and compares it to the traveler’s image in the passport database of Customs and Border Protection.

“We’re seeing about three seconds for the photograph to be taken, transmitted and a positive response back,” said Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue’s executive vice president of customer experience.

Facial recognition will be expanded. Ms. Geraghty said this was the beginning of a new era for travelers.

“You can go into an airport and you won’t need to show a boarding card, you won’t need to pull out a passport,” she said. “There will be no bag tag, no lines, you almost walk right onto an aircraft. That’s the world I look forward to.”

Intelligent Machines

Ms. Geraghty is like many aviation technology specialists who look at developments in other industries and think about how they could improve air travel.

In a workshop in Geneva, SITA has several robots that travel to industry conferences around the world to start conversations about how autonomous vehicles might be used in aviation.

One robot, named Kate , is a self-directed check-in kiosk that moves to areas of congestion as needed. The other robot, Leo , takes bags from passengers and deposits them where they need to be to get routed to the proper destination.

Whether Kate or Leo end up at your local airport is not the point, said Mr. Peters, SITA’s technology chief.

“The robots are also demonstrators to get people talking about what is the future of autonomous vehicles in the airport,” Mr. Peters said. But for all that technology has to offer, one of the most important tests is how well the next new gadget plays with people.

“Some things can be prototyped and some things can’t,” he said. “Some things you have to have a physical interaction with to figure out what works.”

Tim Herrera: Thank you for chatting with me, Abby! Let’s start easy: What are a few benefits of counting calories?

Abby Langer: Counting calories does give you an overall picture of what you’re eating in a day, so that’s a good thing. It’s also helpful for people to understand relative calorie values. (Like that a burger is higher in calories than an apple.)

Counting calories can also be very motivating. I mean, I wanted that slice of gingerbread at Starbucks yesterday, but it was 400 calories … no way.

TH: Those are all really strong positives. So what are some of the downsides here?

AL: Well first of all, nobody really knows how many calories they really need. I mean, 2000 or 2200 is what everybody says an adult male needs, but what if you’re smaller than average? What if you’re more active?

Also, the calorie counts on packaging can actually be off by up to 20 percent and still be within FDA guidelines! Can you imagine? Your 200 calorie snack is now 240 calories or 180 calories.

And don’t forget that processed food is absorbed differently by the body than whole, uncooked food. So really, what I’m trying to say is this: If you think you know how many calories you need, and how many you’re truly getting, you’re probably incorrect. Isn’t that annoying?

(Not to mention the fact that people who are at risk for or who have a history of an eating disorder can be majorly triggered by counting anything.)

TH: Yeesh, that’s so many downsides. What are some alternative tracking methods you’d recommend if people want to track their eating habits?

AL: Writing down what you ate, when you ate it and how you felt — especially if you’re prone to emotional eating — is a great way to keep track of things without drilling it down into numbers. It can be a hassle, but food records can be really effective.

TH: I love food tracking apps, and I feel like they’re sort of a middle ground between a lot of what you’ve talked about. What are your thoughts on those kinds of apps?

AL: The issue with those is that they still count calories, so even if your intentions are good the calorie-count part can be irresistible for some people. And some apps also track activity and subtract calories burned by exercise from calories eaten, and that couldn’t be more wrong.

TH: Yes! They do do that. It sounds like you’re not a fan …

AL: It’s not how your body works. You can’t exercise off food like that! I believe you can only exercise off up to 30 percent of the calories you eat in one day, but with some apps it appears that you can negate your whole day of eating with a trip to the gym. Nope.

TH: So, O.K., despite the downsides, counting calories is still such an easy to way to track food intake. So if people are going to do it anyway (ahem), what’s the bottom line? What should we take away?

It’s not that the town takes the day overly serious. It’s that the people who decorate their homes with skeletons, witches and dismembered torsos don’t take their decorations overly serious.

“No one’s trying to be witty here,” says Timothy Archibald, a longtime resident. “They’re just trying to say it.”

And one other thing: “They’re not doing it to be photographed.”

Photo

But photographed they are. For the past several years, Mr. Archibald has made a point of documenting how his neighbors in the community north of Berkeley celebrate the holiday.

The idea grew out of scene he spotted on Halloween evening in 2013. A neighbor’s yard was filled with costumed children at play. In Archibald’s image (slide 3), the light gives them a ghostly look.

“I think it was the first image I stumbled upon that opened the door for me to want to really explore the season in this town,” he said. “And as a photographer, once you get a magical photo, you try over and over to chase that magic.”

Photo

The photo foreshadows one he took this year of a yard, where a circle of gauze-and-wire ghosts danced. “With the setting sun, it felt like it really was this gathering of souls in a playful afterlife,” he says.

El Sobrante is both a commuter town and a working-class community, and when he is taking pictures of Halloween decorations, Archibald sometimes finds the more affluent sections of town less interesting. “They’re more tasteful there,” he says.

But he likes Halloween however it is celebrated – especially these days.

Photo

“It’s almost like the only thing I’ve seen that has been untouched by politics,” he said, like a man who has never toured the Upper West Side of Manhattan in October or seen a kid in a “Joe the Plumber” costume cheered on by the masses.

Mr. Archibald also seems to prefer Halloween to Christmas, at least as far as decorations go. Homes decked out for Christmas are often garish, he said, and rarely folksy.

And there is a broader difference.

“The Halloween stuff,” he said “never gives you a tingly, ‘Oh, life is beautiful’ feeling.”

The fact that over the last few years “what’s next?” has also begun to mean something more in the fashion world. It has become a stand-in for the constant need for newness driven by technology and 24-hour communication; a nod to the need to speed deliveries and communications, to systematically rethink the interface between customer and company. What and when are the next product drops? The next Instagram story or newsletter?

And coloring it all is the macro meaning: the groan with which people greet every news alert on their phones, the feeling of nauseous anticipation that arises upon every new headline. “What’s next?” meant in reference to the seemingly unpredictable course of global events: What new natural disaster is about to hit; what unexpected political event will unfold; what tweet will send ripples around the globe? What will fall from the sky to unsettle the consumer, disrupt exchange rates and demand new corporate strategy?

Because these many layers of meaning cannot be disaggregated. People do not make purchases in a vacuum.

They buy because they want to feel better, or they don’t buy because they are scared; or they do buy because exchange rates have fallen and suddenly everything is cheaper, or they don’t buy because it is more expensive; or they do buy because, well, time to make hay while the sun shines (or before the bombs fall), or they don’t buy because what they see seems irrelevant to their lives. What happens next in the world changes what needs to come next in luxury. And the tension between those poles is what defines decision-making today.

So we asked a series of decision-makers to tell us “what’s next?” Here are their answers.

The luxury landscape has been changing for quite a while now and the element that has become most apparent is how it has gone from a brand-driven industry to a product-driven one. Brands can no longer rely solely on their image, positioning and status: this means that the offer and the entire productivity chain (from how the products are conceived and produced to the way they are communicated and sold), needs to adapt and be consistent with these changes.

Sustainability, flexibility, responsibility, quality and engagement will be even more important than they are today. They will determine the success of a company in ways beyond what we already can foresee and, most importantly, they will give it the right language and attitude to connect to the new generation of luxury consumers.

So, which C.E.O.s and senior team direct reports will succeed and which will falter?

1. Successful leaders will bring all their capacities to the playing field.

— Those who falter will fail to challenge their own strongly held belief that is untrue or no longer true.

— Those who falter will suffer a fear that drives avoidance of necessary actions or risk-taking and will let ego and emotion dwarf their own intuition.

2. Successful ones will bring all the resources in their ecosystem to bear.

— Those who falter will be afraid to delegate to capable subordinates, will react negatively to thoughtful pushback.

— Those who falter will avoid engaging outside resources to help, claiming frugality or confidentiality.

— Those who falter will have no external personal board of directors.

3. Successful ones will stay focused on the end game.

— Those who falter will get stuck in the details, overwhelmed, distracted by the “shiny new object.”

— Those who falter will stay tactical and short term, preserving the status quo or past.

— Those who falter will have an undisciplined involvement in nonstrategic activities, starving time from what only the C.E.O. can do

Whether it is a coach, an outside mentor, a trusted H.R. chief, the only way humans become aware of these possibly temporary troubled mind-sets is to look in the mirror through someone else’s lens.

In a sense, luxury’s greatest challenge is the same as it ever was: to be more and more relevant to customers and the way they lead their lives.

Having said that, distinctions once critical to our engagement with customers seem less and less relevant. Lines between wholesale and direct-to-consumer trade, domestic and international business, physical and digital storefronts are increasingly blurred.

In a crowded and transparent marketplace, we need to be constantly “top of mind” with our customers without seeming ubiquitous. Given all this, our greatest new focus will be increased personalization and customization of everything from product to content.

The world challenges include the climate, growing inequality, the aspiration for diversity, the rejection of a “one size fits all” global model, the re-emergence of identities, individualities, the aspiration for a more responsible consumption, the aspiration for a more feminine world.

A more feminine world is a world which gives birth to new and beautiful ideas for sustainable growth, it is also a world which takes care of all individuals who feel disengaged.

Therefore the luxury industry will continue to protect the welfare of all people participating in the creation, production and promotion of its products, will protect the environment while improving the traceability of its sourcing and will continue to pay attention to animal welfare. Finally, the role of the most accomplished brands will be to support and serve a larger community than just its clientele by encouraging the community towards a certain mission. Most brands carry missions which go beyond its products; e.g., Nike will encourage audacity, “Just do it!” Apple, simplicity and Chloé, “ freedom to be oneself.”

Beyond a global rise in austerity and digital disruption, the key challenge facing luxury brands is how to keep up with the unprecedented pace of the ever-evolving new luxury consumer. Unlike the previous generation who was romanced by the store experience and stories of craftsmanship, today’s consumer is turned off by the very word “luxury.” For them the term has connotations of elitism and exclusivity. Instead, they want a luxury that is inclusive, honest and democratic.

For the new consumer, status is no longer about how much you can afford to spend on a good, but more about what you stand for and have achieved. They know how to acquire “luxury-quality” at a fraction of the price and seek to be entertained beyond the store and within the digital space. Their first point of contact with a brand is usually via the website or social media channel, which makes it imperative for brands to consider these channels as platforms for information and entertainment and not just commerce. They want brands to care about the values that are important to them such as sustainability.

To keep ahead of this demand, luxury brands will have to focus on how best to enhance the digital experience. Will the advent of new technologies such as A.R. (augmented reality) create a new experience in personalization whereby the brand atelier can be brought into people’s homes?

Of great focus in the coming years will be the integration of luxury into everyday life, which will necessitate design inspired by function as well as beauty and craftsmanship. Further, with more understanding of the impact of our purchases — and in the case of luxury goods, the artisans who made them and the provenance of the materials — we’ll need greater transparency and storytelling on how our products came to be. Finally, we’ll see more and more personalization to reflect individual style, and a continued need to serve consumers seamlessly wherever they are.

The history or the moment of luxury has always been turbulent.

It has been turbulent for luxury to become an industry, and a very dynamic one, quite young still — more or less 40 years.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It has been turbulent for luxury to become international.

It has been turbulent for luxury to embrace many different products under the same “umbrella” (brands) and layers of clients (consumers).

It is turbulent for luxury to cope with quantities, and now, as well, with different generations of people from different cultures.

It is challenging to cope with confusion.

Too many adjectives are tied to the word “luxury”: Accessible, ultimate, soft, hard — implying that most of luxury would be average?

The simple word luxury itself is often misused (not to say mess-used) covering brands, products, or processes irrelevant to the necessary evolution of our society and our world.

The challenge, though, is inspiring — and necessary in order to stay, or become, right.

The answer is not to try to protect or come back to a better yesterday (which day?) nor to follow current trends where statements replace thinking and thoughts, where number of followers have more value than what you propose, or where thinking that “digital” will be a new world, when in fact there is only one world.

We must accept and value complexity, and take uncertainty as a teaser to do better.

Luxury has all the means to be a major reference as soon as it really mixes, in a sustainable way, legacy, know how, innovation, creativity, quality, beauty, fun, the unexpected, in concrete products and offers, always with the sense of integrity (towards itself) and the sense of respect (towards others).

The beauty is that it is not about size but about strength.

Besides, there is not one recipe, but several paths.

That is why solid brands exist with their intangible substance and a long-term view.

In an increasingly fast-paced world with more transparency than ever before, the need for continuous innovation and authenticity is paramount. Brands will continually have to balance innovation with authenticity to their D.N.A., especially in a time of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. This tension has always been present but is magnified with the power and transparency afforded by technology.

One of the industry’s main challenges is undoubtedly the emergence of a new generation of consumers, with unique sets of behaviors and expectations. Millennials, who are accustomed to very high standards of end-to-end service in other industries, will soon become its most important cohort of luxury clients and will put pressure on the traditional models. These “digital natives” consumers follow very different and fragmented decision journeys and are amassing more and more power relative to the brands. Yet, many luxury players fall short of offering them an enriched, personalized, seamless and digitally enabled experience able to conquer their hearts and minds.

Through innovation and utmost personalization, brands must shape the 21st century luxury experience. They should leverage their unique assets and brand heritages but also reinvent their in-store experiences, with the help of new technology, and transpose them online. This calls for a complete shift of luxury brands’ approach to emotionally engage with their customers, starting by using data to provide a tailor-made experience across all touchpoints.

While intelligence in business and in the world at large has changed exponentially, let’s never forget that brands are created by people for people. The game-changer will be when we look at what we can achieve collaboratively and collectively as much as we what we do individually. We are in a new Renaissance, and it’s our responsibility to play a role in how business, culture, humanity and science come together as never before.

The concept of luxury has been around for centuries, not only in physical products and experiences but also in people’s dreams. Today, luxury is not just about price. It means different things to different people. For some, it’s about having the best. For some, it’s about having better. It’s not enough for a brand to create a single definition of luxury — it has to be more democratic than that.

Going forward, we won’t be able to define the luxury consumer based simply on demographics and income. We have to understand them much more personally, so that we can engage with consumers that care about what the brand stands for.

And then we need to combine our creativity and state-of-the-art technology to create highly personalized experiences and products that make people feel special. I think that’s what luxury really is. A feeling that something is special.

The luxury Goods industry will need to manage with the fact that more and more disposable spending is now being spent on experiences rather than goods, as the cupboards are full and the garages are full and the affluent would now rather buy unique, memorable experiences.

Traditionally, sustainability and luxury were opposites. Our key purpose at Soneva since we opened our first resort back in 1995 has been to prove that they are not, and that luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. At Soneva, we manage to offer our guests luxuries whilst minimizing our impact on the planet and enhancing their health.

It is very good to see that over the last 10 years, other companies have adopted a similar belief, such as Kering. It is also good to see such revolutionary concepts like Tesla, which is not just as comfortable as a Merc, a Jaguar or a BMW, but also zero carbon in its operation.

As we start to feel the impact of global warming and other environmental issues, low-impact consumption will become more and more important, especially for luxury brands.

Success will come to those that keep a fresh, strong vision in design. This will put more pressure on the most creative designers to constantly reinvent themselves without losing continuity from a past season. Mid-tier luxury brands could disappear. U.S. luxury in particular will struggle unless designers reinvent themselves. Houses with a portfolio of brands in various states of reinvention will have a better chance of surviving than mono-brands.

Luxury brands will create unique experiences in the retail world to entice and engage customers. Authenticity will win over flash or the slick branding of the early 2000s, which is still evident in most retail stores. Values will matter in fashion and integrating those values into the product lines will be really important — think Stella McCartney’s commitment to sustainable fashion or Alessandro Michele and Gucci’s recent commitment to be fur-free.

He showed no sign of leaving the race ahead of Alabama’s Dec. 12 special election date.

In an afternoon statement, Mr. Moore’s campaign described Ms. Allred as “a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle.” The statement, issued before Ms. Allred’s news conference in New York, denied again “any sexual misconduct with anyone” by Mr. Moore.

Republicans here and in Alabama have been up in arms over the accusations, published last week in The Washington Post, that Mr. Moore pursued sexual or romantic relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The reports have upended a race in a state that has not elected a Democratic senator in 25 years.

In a fund-raising appeal, Mr. Moore reached out to his supporters with the subject line: “Mitch McConnell’s plot to destroy me.”

“Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment G.O.P. would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian,” he wrote.

And Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, lashed out in a Facebook post on Monday, complaining about “a witch hunt” in Alabama and claiming that “we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward.”

“Washington establishment and Democrat Party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign,” she wrote. “Prayers appreciated.....”

But with Mr. McConnell now firmly against his election, Mr. Moore and his candidacy promise to deepen the divide between Republican leaders in Congress and the populist wing of the party that is standing by the Alabamian. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also called for Mr. Moore to drop out of the race on Monday.

Anxious Republican officials spent much of the weekend trying to determine what, if anything, they could do to halt Mr. Moore without simply turning over the seat. If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat.

Photo

But if Mr. Moore stays in and goes on to win, it could leave Senate Republicans with the difficult question of whether to stop him from being seated or seating him and immediately moving to expel him from the chamber.

One idea now being discussed under this scenario, brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, would be for Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama to immediately appoint Attorney General Jeff Sessions to what had been his seat when it becomes vacant again. Mr. Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with President Trump has waned since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s campaign.

Republicans in Washington, though, have not ruled out fielding a write-in candidate and some of the party’s outside groups were expected to conduct surveys this week of who would be most formidable prospect, according to officials familiar with the plans.

Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, said that if additional women like the one joining Ms. Allred tell their stories, it would undermine Mr. Moore’s case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article.

At the news conference in New York, Ms. Nelson grew emotional as she described the assault, which she said happened one night after her shift ended at a local restaurant, where she was a waitress. Her boyfriend was late that night to pick her up after work, she said, and Mr. Moore offered her a ride home. Ms. Nelson said that instead of driving her home, Mr. Moore drove to the back of the restaurant, parked his vehicle and forced himself on her.

Ms. Allred displayed a yearbook she and Ms. Nelson said is signed by Mr. Moore.

In the terror-struck and vertiginous days after Donald Trump’s election a year ago, as I tried to make sense of America’s new reality, I called people who lived, or had lived, under authoritarianism to ask what to expect. I wasn’t looking for concrete predictions — one of the disorienting things about that moment was that no one, no matter how learned, had any idea what was happening — but for insights into how the texture of life changes when an autocratic demagogue is in charge.

A secular Turkish journalist told me, her voice sad and weary, that while people might at first pour into the streets to oppose Trump, eventually the protests would probably die out as a sense of stunned emergency gave way to the slog of sustained opposition. The Russian dissident writer Masha Gessen warned that there’s no way, with a leader who lays siege to the fabric of reality, to fully hold on to a sense of what’s normal. “You drift, and you get warped,” she told me.

They were both right. The country has changed in the past year, and many of us have grown numb after unrelenting shocks. What now passes for ordinary would have once been inconceivable. The government is under the control of an erratic racist who engages in nuclear brinkmanship on Twitter. He is dismantling the State Department, defending the hollowing out of the diplomatic corps by saying, on Fox News, “I’m the only one that matters.”

He publicly pressures the Justice Department to investigate his political opponents. He’s called for reporters to be jailed, and his administration demanded that a sportscaster who criticized him be fired. Official government statements promote his hotels. You can’t protest it all; you’d never do anything else. After the election, many liberals pledged not to “normalize” Trump. But one lesson of this year is that we don’t get to decide what normal looks like.

Last month Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took an unannounced trip to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later had a number of his rivals, including a Trump critic, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, put under arrest. In The Washington Post, David Ignatius described Kushner’s talks with Prince Mohammed this way: “The two princes are said to have stayed up until nearly 4 a.m. several nights, swapping stories and planning strategy.” A year ago, that sentence would have been unintelligible as a description of American diplomacy, even as a wry joke.

There’s a metaphysical whiplash in how quickly alarm turns into acceptance and then into forgetfulness.

Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.

Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.

Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.

Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.

Consider the plan’s shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.

Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.

But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.

“They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,” he said. “And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.”

Photo

At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called “Gilti” (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.

Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.

Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.

Hedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The funds’ decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.

The pass-through changes present other tax dodges. Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services — like doctors, lawyers and accountants — are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000. But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.

“There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,” he said.

Individual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together. Although the Senate’s plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals. Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10-year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.

Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.

“That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,” Mr. Shaviro said.

(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined. Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet. So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)

Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.

At the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committee’s revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. “This is a big giveaway in future years,” she said. “On net, the whole system is ineffective.”

The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year — on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later — will not leave sufficient time.

To some supporters, though, that’s the price of success.

“Will they find things that need to be fixed afterward because the process was moving so fast? Yes,” said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue.

But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don’t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.

The country’s religious leaders regard dogs as unclean, but the use of guard and rescue dogs is accepted.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president of Iran from 2005 to 2013, introduced a program to build low-income housing, including in Pol-e Zahab. After the quake on Sunday, his political opponents said that many of the buildings had been poorly constructed, but his defenders said that the buildings were on fault lines, and that nothing could have been done.

Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, roughly 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage.

Ali Namiq, a resident of the town Darbandikhan, Iraq, said a building was flattened by the quake. “The building fell on a seven-member family,” he told Reuters. “We managed to rescue only five out of them, while the two others were killed. It was the first time for me to see an earthquake. It is a divine act that no one can prevent.”

In the town of Kalar, Iraq, the quake sent items tumbling from shelves in a supermarket, causing shoppers to flee.

The quake occurred about 20 miles south of the Iraqi city of Halabja, where Saddam Hussein’s government launched a poison gas attack that killed more than 5,000 people, mostly Kurds, on March 16, 1988, in the closing days of the Iran-Iraq war.

The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Karbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake.

Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people.

Many primary care doctors have little to no training in how to counsel patients who need to lose weight.
Some have told me that they are afraid patients won’t come back if they focus on a need to lose weight.
The Medicare opportunity notwithstanding, there is a growing need to tackle weight issues much earlier in life.","From 2005 to 2014, the C.D.C. reported in October, there was a 1.4 percent annual increase in cancers related to overweight and obesity among people aged 20 to 49, and a 0.4 percent rise in these cancers among people 50 to 64.

“Nearly half of all cancers in people younger than 65 were associated with overweight and obesity,” C.D.C. experts reported in JAMA. And they predicted that given the current “high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults, children and adolescents,” going forward there will be additional increases in weight-related cancers and cancer deaths among Americans.

The experts called upon clinicians who treat children and adults to do their due diligence and spend more time assessing body mass index (B.M.I.) and counseling patients about how to avoid or reduce excess weight. The payoff in terms of health, life and dollar savings would likely far outweigh the costs of society-wide professional and public health measures to curb America’s expanding waistlines.

Of course, it is not just cases and deaths from cancer that such an effort could prevent. Overweight, and especially obesity, are major risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, gout, gallbladder disease, and respiratory disorders like sleep apnea and asthma.

However, even when the costs of weight assessments and counseling are fully covered by insurance, it seems they are rarely done. In November 2011, the Obama administration offered free weight-loss counseling to obese seniors on Medicare, with no co-payment or deductible for those with Medicare Part B insurance. The benefit, which is still available, applied to the approximately 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with a B.M.I. of 30 or more.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Yet in the first three years, only about 120,000 seniors, representing less than 1 percent of those on Medicare, took advantage of this benefit, a result weight-loss specialists have called “very disappointing” and “a huge lost opportunity.”

The free coverage includes weekly counseling for the first month, a session every other week for months two through six, then monthly sessions for another six months for those who lose at least 6.6 pounds by the sixth month. Participants who fail to hit the six-month target can get a second chance six months later, with no limit to how many times they can take advantage of this benefit if their B.M.I. is still 30 or higher.

To be sure, many of those with serious weight problems have probably tried and failed to lose weight and keep it off, leading them to think there’s little hope that yet another effort will bring success. But it is worth noting that for most people who managed to quit smoking, it typically took anywhere from eight to 30 attempts.

The fault with weight-loss failures may lie almost as much with health care practitioners as with their patients. Many primary care doctors have little to no training in how to counsel patients who need to lose weight. Some have told me that they are afraid patients won’t come back if they focus on a need to lose weight. And patients are often turned off by what they perceive to be their health care providers’ negative attitudes toward people with weight problems.

An online survey by researchers at Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity revealed that people considered terms like “obese,” “fat” and “morbidly obese” to be stigmatizing and blaming language used by doctors. Nearly one participant in five said they would avoid future medical appointments, and 21 percent said they would seek a new doctor, if they felt stigmatized about their weight.

The Medicare opportunity notwithstanding, there is a growing need to tackle weight issues much earlier in life. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health reported in JAMA in July that 23 percent of women and 13 percent of men gained 44 pounds or more between the ages of 18 and 55. And Dr. William H. Dietz of the C.D.C., who noted in an accompanying editorial that “obesity-related cancers in both men and women were associated with moderate weight gain during adulthood,” added that “efforts to prevent and control obesity in young adults should be accorded a high priority.”

Dr. Dietz also pointed to a doubling in the prevalence of obesity between the childhood ages of 6 to 11, now at 17 percent, and young adulthood ages of 20 to 29, now at 34 percent.

Why are so many young Americans seriously overweight? The prevalence of high-calorie snacks and fast foods and cutbacks in physical activity both within and outside of school are not the only reasons. The problem can start as soon as babies are weaned and able to eat solid foods. Too often parents and caretakers, in the interest of keeping youngsters subdued, ply them with snacks all day long, creating in some a lifelong oral drive linking comfort and food.

And, for too many, I’m afraid, an increased risk of developing and dying from cancer.",The Growing Toll of Our Ever-Expanding Waistlines,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/well/eat/the-growing-toll-of-our-ever-expanding-waistlines.html

In an age of digital saturation, perhaps many of these carefully constructed logos are not as memorable as we think. A study conducted in 2014 by psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles similarly asked 85 participants if they could draw the familiar Apple logo from memory. More than half the subjects even identified themselves as strictly Apple users. Yet only one could draw the icon perfectly, as scored by a 14-point rubric.

Should Apple be worried? Not necessarily. Dr. Alan Castel, a psychology professor who was one of the authors of the study, said that the inability to accurately recall such daily ephemera as a brand logo really might be a beneficial quirk of our memory system.

“We don’t burden our memory with things we don’t need to know,” Dr. Castel said. He referred to a famous study in 1979 by the psychologists Raymond Nickerson and Marilyn Jager Adams, in which participants were asked to draw the face of a penny. Most struggled.

“It’s rare that you really need to recall something from memory,” Dr. Castel said. “You simply recognize it, you see it on an item or a computer. You like it, you buy it.”

Still, in recent years, brands like Uber, YouTube, and Dropbox have redesigned their logos, trying to make them more simple, more intuitive or more easily recognizable. In 2014, Airbnb announced its new logo, which it calls the Bélo, in a video that noted that the design was easy for customers to draw.

Paul Stafford, co-founder of DesignStudio, the agency that led the rebranding effort, said that Airbnb envisioned people renting out their homes and putting their own spin on the Bélo — on everything from magazines to bathrobes and shampoo bottles, like a hotel.

“We had to create something that was so simple that everybody could draw it and interpret it themselves,” Mr. Stafford said. “They also wanted people to be sharing it. Right down to the people tattooing the mark on their arms.”

Mr. Stafford, however, said that he did not think that being able to draw a logo necessarily indicates how well it resonates.

People often see logos so much that they feel like they know it. But they rarely critique it or study it enough to reproduce fine details — a phenomenon that psychologists like Dr. Castel call “inattentional amnesia.” When something is seen frequently, the information ends up being more easily ignored or forgotten. For instance, Dr. Castel said he would be curious how accurately people could recall the fine details of a stop sign.

“We know it’s red, but the more subtle features — the exact shape of it, whether there’s a white border around it — these are things we often miss, even though we’ve seen it millions of times,” he said.

Perhaps the most surprising result of the Signs.com study was the company that fared best: Ikea. The Swedish furniture maker with the distinctive blue-and-yellow logo plastered across its giant retail stores was redrawn near-perfectly by 30 percent of the participants.

Asa Nordin, who is a senior coordinator of Ikea trademarks at Inter Ikea Systems, said the unique shape, colors, and longevity of the logo — it has been around since 1983 — most likely contributed to its memorability.

“The logo is merely the symbol for what the Ikea brand promises and delivers,” Ms. Nordin said in an email. “The logo shall mirror that ‘promise’ as near as possible, as well as stand out from its surroundings. To be consistent and unique is clearly a strength of a logo.”

The hardest logo to draw was Starbucks, which was redesigned in 2011. It is also arguably the most complex.

“Simplicity is key,” Mr. James said. “That’s not necessarily a new concept. But this definitely corroborates that idea.”

But is any logo overwhelmingly memorable? Mr. James is now curious. Initially, he resisted putting an overly straightforward and ubiquitous symbol in his study, like those of McDonald’s or Nike.

La Niña is back, but not with a vengeance.

The National Weather Service on Thursday announced the return of La Niña, which occurs when the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean is several degrees below normal for an extended period. The oceanic conditions are the opposite of El Niño.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

This year’s version of La Niña was called “weak” by the Weather Service, which estimates it will continue until between February and April. Generally, La Niña means that the southern United States will see temperatures rise and precipitation levels fall. (And vice versa in the northern half of the country, where temperatures generally fall while precipitation levels rise.)

This winter, there is a 30 to 50 percent chance that Central and Southern California will see above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But projections are not guarantees. California had it second-wettest season on record last winter, defying forecasts for dry conditions.

“All of these jurors, save one, have been deliberating since Monday, and I would hope that at the end of the day, after they finish tomorrow, that those who continue to believe in my innocence will stand strong and that at the end of the day no juror will be coerced,” he said. “I believe no juror should be coerced.”

Mr. Menendez and a co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor from Florida, have been accused of various corruption charges, including bribery and conspiracy. Prosecutors say Mr. Menendez used his office to provide favors to Dr. Melgen in exchange for gifts, rides on his private plane and political contributions. Both men have denied the charges.

The note from jurors came three hours after they had started a new round of deliberations after the juror was excused on Thursday so she could go on a vacation that had been planned before the trail began. Her excusal, and subsequent media interviews, injected drama into a case that had been relatively staid.

“I’m praying for him that they do not find him guilty,” Evelyn Maultsby, the excused juror, told reporters on Thursday.

Ms. Maultsby’s comments, including accusing fellow jurors of preventing her from expressing her opinion, were widely broadcast, bringing national attention to the trial.

On Monday morning, four jurors admitted in court to having seen news reports about Ms. Maultsby’s comments, even though they had been warned by Judge Walls against following any trial coverage.

Mr. Lowell said Ms. Maultsby’s complaint that she was prevented from giving a note to the judge represented the “potential that there was misconduct.”

But Judge Walls was emphatic that the trial would proceed. “If you were suggesting that somehow this is a genesis of a mistrial, I am saying that you’re off target,” he said. “You’re way off target. There is no way in God’s green earth that this judge is going to grant a mistrial when we have available to us a new jury.”

Nonetheless, the judge asked the jurors if any of them had seen news reports about Ms. Maultsby. He then interviewed those who had said yes in his chambers, with the defense and prosecution present, before returning to the bench and instructing the jury to restart deliberations.

“You are now a new jury,” Judge Walls said. “You are to disregard whatever you negotiated or deliberated on last week. You’re starting fresh.”

He also issued new instructions. “Every juror has the right to communicate at any and all times with regard to deliberations,” Judge Walls said. “All you need to do is to step outside the door. The guards are there, and he’s on hand to take whatever message you want to give to me in writing.”

Ms. Maultsby’s comments represented a rare moment: an excused juror offering a window into the usually secretive deliberation process while sitting jurors were still debating.

Excusing a juror because of a planned vacation, while uncommon, is not unheard-of. What is unusual is learning details about an ongoing deliberation.

Shira A. Scheindlin, a former federal judge, said, “The only thing I’m surprised about is that he didn’t instruct her not to say anything.”

Ms. Scheindlin said that “jurors are always free to speak to the press after the verdict,” but “not while it’s going on.” And while judges cannot legally prohibit an excused juror from speaking to reporters, they often issue a warning to wait until a verdict has been rendered. Judge Walls did not give any such warning.

Now in its 11th week, the trial had been estimated to last six to eight weeks. During jury selection in August, Judge Walls agreed to let Ms. Maultsby go on vacation if the trial had not concluded by Nov. 10.

Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district.
Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way.
Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes.
At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about.","Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign — the candidate had a demanding day job — was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities. She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reid’s incumbent Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry,” she’d say, with mock solemnity, “Delegate Greason.”

What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues — how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed — were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, “That’s not a congressional thing, that’s a state thing!” or “That’s not a state thing, that’s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!” Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: “Don’t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don’t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn’t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!”

If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it. When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment. “I didn’t want to rain on their ideas,” she said. Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions. She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how he’d come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. She also told them about Reid’s Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry, Delegate Greason” — and all the party-line votes he’d made down in Richmond. “He votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership. From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, he’s for it.”

To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn’t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn’t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large “steering committees” — and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit — but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.

In the months after Trump’s inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left — protests, actions — but few electoral conduits for its new resolve. Virginia provided one of them. In what Sorenson unsentimentally called “16,” Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous year’s election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34. Not a single incumbent lost. Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldn’t help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts. If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority. This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasn’t blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house.

A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid’s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn’t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups’ lists with what she called “hair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.”

Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. “There’s just this huge energy,” Sorenson told me, “with people saying, ‘We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.’ ” They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn’t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.

She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women’s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.

Sorenson’s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification “(co-leader?)” or “(steering committee member?).” She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (“all talk no plans”); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they’d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn’t need the help badly enough.

Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her “Cadillac plan.” The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts — the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community — are gated and thus “unknockable,” which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.

Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason’s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates — bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.

It wasn’t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn’t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson’s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial — volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message — was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.

In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, “No one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.” Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and “this here is ground zero.”

By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign. They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener — a “Weekend of Action” — in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Women’s Summit. This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before. These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate — most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color. Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district. She didn’t want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reid’s) effort early and for good reasons.

The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff’s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.

Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid’s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family’s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.

Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. “Am I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?”

Reid looked to Sorenson before responding. “Nobody will ask you because you look like the district — it’s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it’s really starting to make a difference.” The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid’s biography — a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country — than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.

Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She’d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. “Now the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It’s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren’t caring about Black Lives Matter, well — it kind of opened my eyes. We can’t ever not be engaged again. It’s like the Founding Fathers’ idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they’re on Facebook but they’re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There’s nothing else going on in ’17, and there’s all this pent-up energy.”

Francesca said she had gone to the Women’s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn’t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn’t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgendered former journalist and “freshman member of the Democratic Party” who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. “My opponent,” she said with national-stage charisma, “cares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!” Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. “We’re literally fighting for our democracy,” she said. “It’s ‘Handmaid’s Tale.’ ”

We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people’s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.

In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.

“I don’t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,” she said.

“Well, I was never out canvassing before, either!” Francesca said.

Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a “1” on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a “5.” On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.

By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn’t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign’s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home’s “no soliciting” sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.

This didn’t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups — an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues — and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn’t sure there was much she could do. “They have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.”

The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldn’t afford to dedicate any more time to it just then. She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine. There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trump’s travel ban, and I read it aloud. At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Then she said: “Oh, him. I can’t even worry about him. I can’t even think about him.” She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards. It lasted an hour.

It is never easy to assess a campaign’s progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere. A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorenson’s most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List. Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper. They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June — $53,000 to his $39,000 — with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors. Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank. On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaign’s Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaign’s website. “I was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.” By the end of August they’d visited 32,556 doors. The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions.

The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state’s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate — a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie — hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president’s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of “sanctuary cities,” even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.

It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson’s race, though the summer poll wasn’t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they’d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.

Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He’d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. “There’s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs” for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, “after what we’ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.” He did not seem like the sort of person who’d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.

For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign. They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondent’s vote. The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greason’s record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes — 713, to be precise. A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greason’s absences as a percentage. Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes. Once he left, she looked up. “I know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason! We do not want to express it as a percentage.”

For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign’s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump’s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.

With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign’s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they’d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson’s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken “tens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.” Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. “Well, that last part’s true.”

Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, “We need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.” Sorenson didn’t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, “is just beautiful to me.” And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia “the first statewide referendum on Trump,” that was fine with her, as long as they didn’t set expectations so high that their support couldn’t survive a disappointment.

Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain. Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies. She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters. Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand. She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter who’d had her ballot disqualified for no reason.

The foot traffic — not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa — was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they’d done, over their 11-day “mobilization window,” of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered “I voted” stickers. Then they’d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. “When do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.”

Sorenson didn’t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in — turnout, she thought, couldn’t realistically be as high as it seemed to be — but by 4 o’clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign’s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.

The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun’s precincts were reporting. Reid’s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. “You are so [expletive] awesome,“ one said. “You brought happiness back into our lives,” said another.

Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors — the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory — to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from “Joe Biden’s guy.”

Her finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: “How are you so calm? I feel like we’ve all been in our little bubble, but look” — she gestured toward the television overhead — “we’re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?”

Sorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. “I just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.”",How the ‘Resistance’ Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/magazine/how-the-resistance-helped-democrats-dominate-virginia.html

This wish was at once selfless and self-protecting: Beau couldn’t bear the thought of his illness derailing his father’s political aspirations. Biden understood this. He went with it. The whole family did. Dreaming of 2016, he writes, sometimes became a kind of performance, a family diversion: “It was as if we were all keeping up an elaborate and needful charade.”

This charade also happened to suit Biden. Entertaining a presidential bid during those dark days gave him meaning, “a way to defy the fates.” And part of him obviously wanted to run.

Biden’s life was full of surreal juxtapositions during Beau’s illness. One minute, he was sitting at his son’s bedside in the hospital; the next, he was in a specially designated room nearby, talking to the prime minister of Iraq. The work focused him, allowing him to contain his feelings. But those feelings would heave to the surface in private. On March 29, 2015, as Air Force Two was taking off, he wrote in his diary that he felt buoyed and hopeful. A few hours later, he added three staccato sentences. Just landed. 6:07. I feel so goddam lonely.

These flashes of vulnerability are part of what makes “Promise Me, Dad” memorable; so, too, are the small, tender interactions between Biden and his dying son. “Guess who was at the office today?” Biden asked Beau one night. Elton John. “You remember when I used to drive you and Hunt to school? That song we would all sing together, the three of us, as loud as we could?” Beau couldn’t answer by then; he was no longer capable of speech. But he smiled. So Biden sang as much of “Crocodile Rock” as he could remember.

Soon after he was first elected to the Senate in 1972, Biden’s wife, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. He has a great, unwanted body of expertise in coping with loss. “Promise Me, Dad” shows that he’s willing to make use of it. Imparting what he knows about bereavement is part of his legacy now.

He gives his philosophy of the eulogy. He shares tricks he’s learned about how to bear up and survive the earliest days of mourning. When he speaks at funerals and memorials, he writes, he often gives his private phone number to the grieving. “When you’re down and you feel guilty for burdening your family and friends,” he tells them, “pick up the phone and call.” Some do.

It’s to Biden’s credit that you don’t really question these anecdotes. He may be a bit excitable, a bit of a windbag. But anyone who’s ever covered Congress (I did, for a while) can discern on the page what was discernible in real life: the bartender aspect of Biden’s character, the natural convener who reads customers well enough to put them at ease. He’s always understood that the political is personal.

Which leads to the inevitable question: Is “Promise Me, Dad” secretly a campaign book?

The way he repeatedly recounts his accomplishments and expertise certainly suggests he’s thinking about a 2020 run, as does the way he finds multiple excuses to invoke his middle-class bona fides. His advisers, he pointedly tells us, concluded in 2015 that his reputation as a “gaffe machine” was no longer a liability. “Authenticity matters,” one of them wrote.

The suggestion being that he’s Trump minus the Trump.

For Biden, the heart of 2015 contained a paradox. He faced tremendous pressure inside his own home to run for president, for Beau’s sake. But outside his home, the pressure for him to run didn’t reach its peak until after Beau died, the very moment he was least able to handle the strains of a national campaign. Yet that was when many of his former colleagues from the Senate urged him to jump in. That was when George Clooney got in touch and offered to raise money.

And then Hillary Clinton lost — in many of the states where Biden appeared to poll well.

It must have been a powerful formula for regret. Even if, as Barack Obama suspected, Clinton had the nomination sewn up. Obama had discouraged Biden from making the leap from the start.

So Biden ends his book outlining the agenda for the 2016 presidential campaign he never ran. It’s an unrealized story, vibrantly alive on the page but not in the world. Just like Beau. It’s all tied up with Beau.","In Joe Biden’s Memoir, Private Grief and Its Effect on a Public Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review-joe-biden-promise-me-dad-memoir.html

But Transworld’s employees did not have personal knowledge, the consumer bureau said in its complaint against the debt collector.

Other companies had created the records reviewed by Transworld employees. Those workers, the consumer bureau said, did not know how the data was maintained and whether it was correct. Even so, employees signed the forms “for fear of losing their jobs,” according to the bureau’s complaint.

The hasty review process obscured defects. More than 800 cases involved apparent time travel: In those instances, Transworld employees swore that borrowers’ loans had been purchased by investors on dates that were months or even years before the loans were actually made.

Transworld, based in Fort Washington, Pa., said it disagreed with many of the consumer bureau’s accusations. The company agreed to settle the case, it said in a statement, to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation.

The company’s review process “accords with all industry best practices and relevant law,” David Zwick, Transworld’s chief financial officer, said in a statement to The Times.

Transworld “processes thousands of affidavits, and while our error rate is exceptionally low, we believe that any mistake is unacceptable,” Mr. Zwick said. “We will continue to regularly review everything we do in order to ensure the highest standards of quality control.”

Lisa Kyser, in Pataskala, Ohio, said she got tangled up in one of Transworld’s mistakes. She took out half a dozen student loans as she juggled her college studies with full-time jobs, but she thought she had all of them under control.

In June 2016, Ms. Kyser got a summons notifying her that she was being sued for falling behind on a $12,000 loan made in 2006. Two weeks later, she got a second summons also seeking payment — to a different creditor, for a different amount — on the same loan.

The cases lingered for five months, while Ms. Kyser racked up legal fees. In the end, after her lawyer continually pestered them, the law firms that sued Ms. Kyser — both working for Transworld — withdrew the cases.

Courts Digging Deeper

The stacks of legal documents Transworld prepared in that Georgia office park made their way to courts across the country.

Many of the cases sailed through, unchallenged. Borrowers often do not fight collection lawsuits, which allows the creditor to win by default.

Even when defendants did respond, some judges brushed off their objections. In Miami, a law firm working for Transworld brought a lawsuit last year against Antonio Fuentes, seeking payment on a $13,356 student loan. With interest and fees, Mr. Fuentes now owed $25,322.31, according to the complaint.

Mr. Fuentes, representing himself, admitted that he had taken the loan but disputed the amount he was said to owe. A Transworld employee swore in an affidavit that the tally was correct. The judge sided with Transworld and ordered Mr. Fuentes to pay the full amount.

“The courts are often not sympathetic to these cases,” said N. James Turner, a lawyer in Orlando, Fla., who represents borrowers. “Many judges take the attitude: ‘I paid my student loans. You ought to pay yours. Don’t give me this nonsense about technicalities.’”

But some judges are starting to raise questions about collection cases.

Last year, a California appeals court cast doubt on the company’s affidavits. Employees of Transword, then known as NCO Financial Systems, were not “personally familiar” with the records they swore were accurate, the judges wrote, and therefore could not vouch for them in court. The case was tossed out.

It’s not just debt collectors facing judicial skepticism, but also the creditors themselves.

■ Rules designed to prevent highly paid doctors, lawyers and other service providers from cashing in on new benefits aimed at small businesses can be easily circumvented.

Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.

Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.

Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.

Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.

Consider the plan’s shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.

Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.

But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.

“They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,” he said. “And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.”

At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called “Gilti” (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.

Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.

Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.

Hedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The funds’ decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.

The pass-through changes present other tax dodges. Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services — like doctors, lawyers and accountants — are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000. But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.

“There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,” he said.

Individual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together. Although the Senate’s plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals. Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10-year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.

Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.

“That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,” Mr. Shaviro said.

(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined. Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet. So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)

Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.

At the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committee’s revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. “This is a big giveaway in future years,” she said. “On net, the whole system is ineffective.”

The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year — on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later — will not leave sufficient time.

To some supporters, though, that’s the price of success.

“Will they find things that need to be fixed afterward because the process was moving so fast? Yes,” said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue.

But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don’t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.

The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

What every modern Thanksgiving table needs is one great dish that anyone can eat. It should be satisfying and hearty enough to be a meal on its own, but appealing enough to share as a side dish.

This golden-topped casserole of wild rice, white beans and seared mushrooms fits the bill.

The white beans, some of which are puréed, give it creaminess, while the wild rice adds a robust, chewy texture. The combination of mushrooms, leeks and fennel makes it autumnal. And plenty of sautéed spinach not only helps lighten the starchiness of the beans and rice, but also adds some necessary color.

Like many casseroles, this one is adaptable so you can tailor it to your tastes and your crowd. You can use gluten-free panko for celiac friends, or leave off the Parmesan in the topping for vegans and the lactose-intolerant. If you can’t get, or don’t want to spring for, the pricey wild rice, brown rice makes an equally nubby substitute. Cilantro haters can substitute basil.

One thing to keep in mind is that canned beans vary a lot in terms of salt content. If possible, find a brand that lists sea salt as an ingredient. These tend to have a better flavor than unsalted beans. But in either case, taste as you go, adjusting the salt as you see fit.

Conveniently for Thanksgiving (or any other dinner party), you can assemble the components for this dish the day before you want to serve it. Store the filling and topping separately in the fridge. Just before baking, spread the crumbs over the casserole and bake until steaming hot inside and golden on top.

Then serve it to your loved ones, because this is a dish they all can love.

Mr. Menendez and a co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor from Florida, have been accused of various corruption charges, including bribery and conspiracy. Prosecutors say Mr. Menendez used his office to provide favors to Dr. Melgen in exchange for gifts, rides on his private plane and political contributions. Both men have denied the charges.

Mr. Lowell said Ms. Maultsby’s complaint that she was prevented from giving a note to the judge represented the “potential that there was misconduct.”

But Judge Walls was emphatic that the trial would proceed. “If you were suggesting that somehow this is a genesis of a mistrial, I am saying that you’re off target,” he said. “You’re way off target. There is no way in God’s green earth that this judge is going to grant a mistrial when we have available to us a new jury.”

Nonetheless, the judge asked the jurors if any of them had seen news reports about Ms. Maultsby. He then interviewed those who had said yes in his chambers, with the defense and prosecution present, before returning to the bench and instructing the jury to restart deliberations.

“You are now a new jury,” Judge Walls said. “You are to disregard whatever you negotiated or deliberated on last week. You’re starting fresh.”

He also issued new instructions. “Every juror has the right to communicate at any and all times with regard to deliberations,” Judge Walls said. “All you need to do is to step outside the door. The guards are there, and he’s on hand to take whatever message you want to give to me in writing.”

Ms. Maultsby’s comments represented a rare moment: an excused juror offering a window into the usually secretive deliberation process while sitting jurors were still debating.

Excusing a juror because of a planned vacation, while uncommon, is not unheard-of. What is unusual is learning details about an ongoing deliberation.

Shira A. Scheindlin, a former federal judge, said, “The only thing I’m surprised about is that he didn’t instruct her not to say anything.”

Ms. Scheindlin said that “jurors are always free to speak to the press after the verdict,” but “not while it’s going on.” And while judges cannot legally prohibit an excused juror from speaking to reporters, they often issue a warning to wait until a verdict has been rendered. Judge Walls did not give any such warning.

Now in its 11th week, the trial had been estimated to last six to eight weeks. During jury selection in August, Judge Walls agreed to let Ms. Maultsby go on vacation if the trial had not concluded by Nov. 10.

Designed solely as an electric vehicle, the Bolt has no provision for carrying a spare.
BMW offers a compact spare kit — including jack and wrench — for many of its X Series sport utility vehicles and for the 5 and 7 Series sedans.
In most cases, it’s a $150 option when ordering the car, though on some models with conventional tires it is free.
The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency.","An increasingly popular alternative to spares is the so-called run-flat design, which most new BMW models use. Intended to make roadside tire changes unnecessary, this solution employs a reinforced tire sidewall that typically lets the driver continue for 50 miles at up to 50 miles an hour after air pressure is lost. But they can be more costly: It may be necessary to replace, rather than simply patch, a damaged tire, and replacements are typically priced $25 to $50 higher than a conventional design.

Another alternative is the self-sealing tire, an older solution reappearing in modern form on the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt, where reduced weight translates to more miles per charge. Designed solely as an electric vehicle, the Bolt has no provision for carrying a spare. According to Michelin, which supplies the Bolt’s Energy Saver A/S Selfseal rubber, the extra cost of a self-sealing tire — which can continue down the road even with a nail in the tread — is about $33 compared with conventional tires of the same size.

But some models are losing the spare without the benefit of run-flat or self-sealing rubber, instead including conventional tires and a leak repair kit — packaged in an aerosol can or used in conjunction with a small air compressor powered by the car’s battery.

Such kits skim weight while skipping the tire, but have limited abilities to deal with any road hazard more serious than a nail hole in the tire’s tread section. A larger tear in the tire — something that can happen when modern low-profile tires meet a pothole — or damage to the sidewall or wheel rim will not be fixed by a leak kit. The sealants, which are usually one-time use devices, have a finite shelf life — usually from four to eight years, AAA said — and cost about $40 to replace.

Even if a leak sealant kit gets you back on the road in a hurry after a minor puncture, it could complicate a permanent repair. Affixing an internal patch after a sealant has been used requires a thorough cleanup of all the goo inside, said Tom Carter, technical communications director for Michelin.

For a car owner — and certainly renters who might not know what they are getting into — the best way to prevent an unpleasant middle-of-the-night surprise is to check for a spare and be sure that it holds air. If there’s a sealant kit instead, read the owner’s manual (which may be on a DVD or available on the car’s display screen) and learn how to use it.

In some cases, greater peace of mind is available from the automakers.

For instance, although mainstream versions of the 2017 Honda Civic come from the factory with space-saver spares, the Civic Si does not. A spare wheel kit, including a jack and tools, is available from Honda dealers as an accessory for the Civic Si at a suggested retail price of $254. The tire, which must be purchased separately, runs about $115 from sources like Tirerack.com.

BMW offers a compact spare kit — including jack and wrench — for many of its X Series sport utility vehicles and for the 5 and 7 Series sedans. In most cases, it’s a $150 option when ordering the car, though on some models with conventional tires it is free. On the sport utility models, the compact spare fits entirely within a compartment under the rear floor, but on the sedans it juts out too high, meaning the floor panel cannot lie flat.

Not surprisingly, independent online retailers have also emerged to fill the hole. Buyers should make sure to compare prices with the dealership and to determine that there is a storage spot in the car where the tire can be secured. As designers work to smooth airflow under the car for fuel-economy improvements, those compartments are going away, too.

The disappearance of the spare tire might be more than just an exercise in efficiency. It may be a sociological statement. A survey by AAA found that some 20 percent of drivers do not know how to change a flat tire, and with the rise of roadside assistance coverage for new cars, that number is unlikely to shrink.

The era of cars proudly displaying a spare tire mounted on the front fender or rear bumper — a standby of prewar classics — is long gone, and the tradition of suburban dads gathering to inspect a neighbor’s new purchase may have to undergo a major change.

Instead of crowding around the front end to see what’s under the hood, perhaps they’ll be checking the trunk to see if it’s got a spare.","Cars Lose the Spare Tire for a Leaner Ride, but It Could Cost You",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/business/spare-tires.html

The rare cache of supercentenarian genomes, the largest yet to be sequenced and made public, comes as studies of garden-variety longevity have yielded few solid clues to healthy aging. Lifestyle and luck, it seems, still factor heavily into why people live into their 90s and 100s.

To the extent that they have a genetic advantage, it appears to come partly from having inherited fewer than usual DNA variations known to raise the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other afflictions.

That is not enough, some researchers say, to explain what they call “truly rare survival,” or why supercentenarians are more uniformly healthy than centenarians in their final months and years.

Rather than having won dozens of hereditary coin tosses with DNA variations that are less bad, scientists suggest, supercentenarians may possess genetic code that actively protects them from aging.

But the effort to find that code has been “challenged,” as a group of leading longevity researchers put it in a recent academic paper, in part by the difficulties in acquiring supercentenarian DNA.

The New England Centenarian Study, one of a handful of longevity research groups around the world focusing on supercentenarians, now turns down prospective DNA donors under age 103: “We tell them they’re too young,” said Dr. Thomas Perls, the study’s director.

The DNA sequences being released this week were acquired almost single-handedly by James Clement, 61, the founder of a company advised by the prominent Harvard geneticist George Church.

A professed citizen-scientist, Mr. Clement collected blood, skin or saliva from supercentenarians in 14 states and seven countries over a six-year period. Many were still gardening, arguing, driving and flirting. Ms. Michelson, for one, was fond of reading and reciting Shakespeare.

The usefulness of such a small group for a genetic study is unclear, which is one reason Mr. Clement’s company, now defunct, has turned into a crowdsourcing project.

Complex traits like height, body mass index and disease risk — phenotypes, as they are known in genetics-speak — typically arise from a combination of hundreds of places in the genome where the DNA alphabet differs between individuals.

Zeroing in on which variations affect which phenotypes requires the statistical power of tens of thousands of DNA samples — almost certainly a dealbreaker when it comes to supercentenarians, whose verified number, worldwide, hovers at around 150.

On large swaths of the planet, where birth records are sketchy or nonexistent, identifying verified supercentenarians is virtually impossible. In the United States, researchers say supercentenarians account for about one in five million people.

Amateur genealogists dedicated to validating the ages of the world’s oldest people estimate that even the unverified total comes to only about 1,000.

Still, some researchers hope that despite the limited number of available genomes, it will be possible to identify the secret sauce of supercentenarians with methods used to uncover the genetic basis for other rare conditions. No one quite knows how many genomes might be necessary.

“This is what we call an ‘extreme phenotype,’ ” said Dr. Church, who ultimately arranged for the genomes to be sequenced so that Mr. Clement could release them through a nonprofit. “The farther out you go on the bell curve, the more likely you are to find something, even with a small sample size.”

As the goal of slowing aging to extend human “health span” has gained traction in the scientific mainstream, research has largely been limited to animal studies.

A secretive Google spinoff called Calico, for California Life Company, is said to be scrutinizing the genome of the naked mole rat, celebrated for a life span 10 times longer than that of most of its rat cousins. Federally funded scientists are testing a drug on monkeys based on an experiment that doubled the lives of roundworms.

And in laboratories across the world, the markers of age in over-the-hill mice, rats and turquoise killifish are, sometimes, being reversed.

But what works in shorter-lived organisms often does not translate to humans, whose average life span in developed countries is approaching 80 years. So despite the limitations of Mr. Clement’s database, several prominent researchers have already expressed interest in it.

“This could show the utility of starting a bigger collection,” said Paola Sebastiani, a longevity researcher at Boston University.

An account of what Mr. Clement calls the Supercentenarian Research Project offers a glimpse at what that might entail, including perseverance, compassion and a sense of humor that trends toward dark.

Life or Death

It was an inauspicious start, Mr. Clement admitted in an email to a friend in January 2011. The first supercentenarian Mr. Clement had lined up to visit, Mississippi Winn, had died at 113 before he could get from his home in San Jose, Calif., to hers in Shreveport, La.

Photo

“RIP Miss Winn,” he posted on the Facebook page that family members had set up for Ms. Winn, believed to be the last living child of African-Americans born into slavery.

Such condolences would become a familiar refrain. Of the 70,000 or so Americans who live to be 100, only some two dozen are typically alive at 110.

Once that milestone is reached, as Mr. Clement quickly learned, the chance of dying within the next year is roughly 50 percent. After 113, the odds are closer to 66 percent. The oldest person on record, Jeanne Calment, was 122 when she died in 1997; only one other person is known to have lived beyond age 118.

“Even while you’re packing the car, the person may fall ill and say they’re not up to it,” Mr. Clement said, after the first of several plans for me to observe a DNA donation was abruptly canceled.

Mr. Clement could extract DNA from post-mortem samples, with permission from the family and assuming he could reach the funeral home in time. Exhumation is also possible, in theory, to obtain samples.

But for understandable reasons, he said, family members most often ended communications with him at the time of a supercentenarian’s death. To improve the odds of getting samples — and the gender balance, since supercentenarians are nearly all women — he lowered his target age from 110 to 106.

“It’s better to get there when they’re alive,” he said.

Guided by the World’s Oldest People email list, whose moderator, Robert D. Young, verifies ages on behalf of Guinness World Records and tracks supercentenarians for the Gerontology Research Group, Mr. Clement placed decal dots designating the locations of prospective participants on a map pinned to the wall of his home office.

He created Google alerts for the phrases “109th birthday,” “110th birthday,” and “111th birthday,” and for the obituaries of known supercentenarians.

Unlike so-called blue zones, where centenarians are said to cluster, there is no geographical shortcut for netting supercentenarians. So he called, emailed and sent Facebook friend requests to whatever contacts he could find, wherever he could find them.

A Birthday Invitation

There was, nominally, the prospect of making money.

But with a business plan that, even to some of his investors, sounded more like a research project, Mr. Clement seems to have undertaken the task largely because it provided the chance to act on a longstanding interest in human longevity, including his own.

A self-described transhumanist who eats mostly low-glycemic vegetables and nuts and walks seven miles a day, Mr. Clement has accumulated an eclectic résumé that includes starting a brew pub, practicing international tax law and cofounding a futurist magazine.

He harbors what he prefers to call a “healthy love of life,” rather than an aversion to death, and he is possessed of an apparently genuine conviction that longer lives would make humans more humane.

“My hat was off to someone who was willing to take the time out of his life to go get these precious specimens,” said Dr. Church, the Harvard geneticist, who has devoted a portion of his laboratory to research into the reversal of aging.

The kind of ultrarare mutations that supercentenarians might harbor, Dr. Church believed, were not likely to be detected with standard techniques, which scan only the places in the genome where DNA is already known to vary between individuals.

To look for as-yet-uncataloged variations would require sequencing all of the supercentenarians’ six billion genetic letters, a far more expensive procedure. When he and Mr. Clement first discussed the idea in 2010, the cost was about $50,000 per genome.

But the price was falling. And with the financial support of a handful of like-minded wealthy individuals who agreed to invest in the exploratory phase of the project, “it just seemed,” Mr. Clement said, “like something I could do.”

Even with the Harvard name as a calling card, several of the families he contacted over the next few years did not respond to his inquiries. A few, Mr. Clement knew, had already been approached by laboratories at Stanford and Boston University, which were collecting their own stashes of supercentenarian DNA.

“She already did her DNA donation,” Paul Cooper, the grandson of Besse Cooper, a 116-year-old former suffragist, told Mr. Clement, who had driven several hundred miles to her Monroe, Ga., nursing home in 2012.

Walter Breuning, of Great Falls, Mont., one of just a handful of men known to have lived to 114, replied in late 2010 that it was his preference not to risk winter meetings. He died early the next spring.

An invitation to the 111th birthday party of James Sisnett in Barbados finally served as Mr. Clement’s entree in February 2011. He died two years later.

Mr. Sisnett, who grew his own food until he was 105, was “still fascinated by seeing a nice-looking backside” when he was in his 110s, his daughter, Everine Carter, 88, recalled in a telephone interview.

Losing Precious Samples

The best time to get DNA from a supercentenarian, Mr. Clement found, is midmorning. By lunchtime, they would prefer to be eating. After lunch, they might be groggy or napping.

Most, like Dorothy Peel of London, then 108, had sharp minds. Ms. Peel inspected the informed consent form through her reading glasses and peppered him with questions about other supercentenarians he had met.

Photo

Crisscrossing Europe in 2011, Mr. Clement hit his collecting stride. But there were some bumps.

He had ordered an inexpensive kit that allowed him to prick a supercentenarian’s finger and deposit a drop of blood on a card to preserve it, often used by geneticists in the field.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Within a few months he had blood drops from 15 donors, including Ralph Tarrant of Sheffield, England, who at 108 completed the London Times crossword puzzle every afternoon.

Not until he had switched to hiring a phlebotomist to perform blood draws with a needle did he learn that the cards with the original 15 samples were defective. “We could not detect any DNA,” read a 2011 email from the laboratory.

Mr. Clement confessed the news to Dr. Church in a meeting at his Harvard office. “You didn’t test the cards?” the geneticist asked him gently.

Still, Mr. Clement had 23 good samples in hand, and the cost of sequencing by this time had fallen to some $15,000 per genome. With his remaining funds, he sequenced 15, leaving the rest in cold storage.

Photo

Mr. Clement quickly discovered 2,500 differences between the supercentenarian DNA and those of controls. But even with help from graduate students in Dr. Church’s lab, it was hard with such a small group to know which, if any, were significant.

So over the next few years, Mr. Clement, working without a salary, collected samples whenever he could, adding another dozen from supercentenarians across the United States.

In the spring of last year, a company Dr. Church had co-founded, Veritas Genetics, announced that it would sequence human genomes for $1,000 each. Dr. Church told Mr. Clement that Veritas would sequence the remaining samples, and so he set out to collect a few more.

Advice From America’s Oldest Man

In July 2016, I was invited to accompany Mr. Clement to Mr. Matthews’s home in California. As much as I looked forward to meeting my first supercentenarian, I was not prepared to envy his win in the genetic longevity lottery.

I had feared he would be lonely, a concern echoed by several of the Facebook viewers who watched me ply him with questions over a live video stream the morning we met. “I don’t want to outlive my friends and family,” one typed. “That’s no fun.”

The prospect of shifting today’s average life span to that of the known limit of all humanity is disorienting. An average life expectancy of 80 in some ways seems generous — it was just 48 when Mr. Matthews was born in 1906. Most of us expect around 80 years on the planet, assuming nothing horrendous happens.

“When you have children the first time, it don’t come with a manual, and it don’t come with a manual when your dad gets to be 100, then 105, then 110,” said Mr. Matthews’s son, Steve, 75, who also gave blood the day we visited.

But Mr. Matthews asserted without hesitation that he still enjoyed life. Pleasures included his lunchtime smoothie, his family, the kindness of his caregiver, and — this with a nod to a New York Times photographer and a rakish grin — “having my picture taken.”

He reminisced fondly about his second wife, Katherine, who died in 1980 and with whom he had loved to dance.

At 110, he said he had never been diagnosed with a serious illness. The younger Mr. Matthews recalled that his father had played a one-under-par, 18-hole golf game on his 99th birthday. Having built a successful real estate business, he provided financial support to his last surviving sibling, a sister who was 105.

Talking to him, it was hard not to fantasize about the possibility that, as another Facebook participant suggested, “by the time we get to that age, we may all be living to 110.”

At the time the oldest man in America, Mr. Matthews sometimes strained to hear, but his sense of humor and perspective were intact. If that was what we wanted, he advised, “Keep breathing.”

Mr. Matthews died this summer. His DNA was sequenced a few weeks later, and last month Mr. Clement uploaded it to the database. Like all normal human genome sequences, the beginning of his first chromosome reads like this:

Last year, 1,100 Nigerian girls made the trip; some 80 percent of them are thought to be trafficking victims.

Because of its geographic centrality and proximity to Italy, Libya is a frequent way station for refugees and victims of trafficking traveling from the Middle East, sub-Saharan and East Africa to Europe.

In Libyan cities, West African men and boys are bought and sold in broad daylight in modern-day slave markets. Migrants with certain skills, like tiling or painting, fetch a higher price. Women and girls are not sold in these markets because they are expected to arrive in Europe ready to work as prostitutes.

Africans with darker skin are taunted and derided as “burned” by Libyan smugglers. Men are beaten and forced to work in unbearable construction jobs for no pay. Aid workers told me that they often see sub-Saharan Africans who make it to Europe or who escape Libya and try to return to their home country with burns and cuts from the torture they’ve endured. Women sometimes arrive pregnant after being raped in Libya.

Those Africans who make it to Italy arrive in a country where name-calling and verbal attacks on even the most prominent black people, like politicians and athletes, is commonplace. Italians accuse Africans of stealing jobs and of all being thieves, rapists, prostitutes and drug dealers.

“Here in Italy, a lot of people think Africans are coming for work, not to escape horrible situations or because they have no choice,” Mr. Rotunno said.

Distinctions by policymakers between “economic migrants,” typically believed to be Africans, and “refugees,” like those fleeing Middle Eastern conflicts, don’t help. All people who flee their homes need help; the choice is no choice.

Tens of thousands of women who have been trafficked from Benin City have remained nameless and faceless to much of the world for decades. But back home, they are known: A 2003 United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute report concluded that “virtually every Benin family has one member or the other involved in trafficking either as a victim, sponsor, madam or trafficker.”

“There’s a lot of misinformation about what opportunities are in Europe,” Federico Soda, the Mediterranean director of the United Nations migrant agency, told me. “People know there’s something better, are seeking it and taking massive risks to try and achieve it, but nobody sets out with the worst possible scenario becoming reality.”

Italian politicians often blame smugglers for migrant deaths. But in the past year, they have enacted policies that have made it much more difficult for migrants to safely reach the country. Italy has struck deals with tribesmen who control Libya’s southern border; persuaded militias to keep boats from leaving Libya for Italy; promised local Libyan leaders money to replace profits from trafficking; and led a campaign to keep nongovernmental humanitarian agencies like Doctors Without Borders from saving people in the sea — all to ensure that fewer migrants get to Europe.

It’s working. Arrivals in Italy of migrants by sea have plunged from 181,000 last year to 114,000 this year. But at what cost? Policies enacted by the Italian government, many backed by the European Union, make the continent’s leaders as culpable as the traffickers who put the young women on the boats in the first place.

The rest of the world should be asking ourselves why the lives of African girls and women remain so cheap.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off.","The Parisian sun casting a warm glow on a balcony overlooking narrow streets, laundry drying overhead. The bustle of a market. Sprawling Provençal vineyards.

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

Photo

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

Unsurprisingly, the city’s newest apartments, dominated by luxury condos, got top dollar, with a median sales price of $3.05 million, almost twice that of units in buildings constructed during the previous decade. The best bargains, however, weren’t found in the oldest apartments, but in the 1950s stock, which sold for a median $737,500, the lowest of any decade. Time was kinder to apartments built before World War II, which reached a sales peak of $1.5 million for apartments in buildings from the early 1900s.

The midcentury price drop is not just a matter of taste, but also of substance. “By postwar, the size of apartments were shrinking, the ceiling heights were down, and the number of rooms declined,” said Andrew S. Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University.

One of the early successes was Manhattan House, built in 1951: a sleek, light-brick building in Lenox Hill, set back from the street with a large green space and private balconies for some residents. Now a condo, the building frequently has $3 million-plus listings.

The model was perhaps too successful, as developers cashed in on the white-brick look with derivative designs on the cheap. “It’s second-class architecture,” said Andrew Alpern, an architectural historian and author, of the era that eschewed the structural hallmarks of prewar design, like double masonry walls for sound insulation and windows in bathrooms and kitchens.

“For a while, they were despised by people who thought they had the right to despise them,” said Carol Herselle Krinsky, a professor of art history at New York University, about the early reception of postwar brick buildings. Even now, she added, “things haven’t changed much.”

As the New York Times lamented in a 1979 article, “Tower after tower of white or brown or red brick is the norm, with cramped rooms that are not so much well laid out as they are squeezed in for maximum profit.”

But these buildings, by and large, were not meant for the elite, historians said. Built mostly as rentals to meet pent-up demand, they catered to the middle class — or at least what passes for middle class in Manhattan.

And they remain some of the most affordable apartments in the city. More than two-thirds of sales in 1960s buildings over the past year were for less than $1 million — more in that price range than in buildings from any decade. Apartments from the 1960s were also among the most popular with the past year’s buyers, accounting for more than 14 percent of the analyzed sales, second only to those from the 1920s (16.3 percent of sales).

Many of the postwar buildings that were built as rentals were converted to co-ops in the 1980s, and they deserve recognition in their own right, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which analyzed the data.

“We could talk all day about the cranes dotting the sky today, but it pales in comparison to the conversion and new-development frenzy of the 1980s,” he said. Because most of the buildings being converted were originally rental, the units tended to be smaller and more affordable — especially compared to the luxury condos being sold today.

That combination of factors is why midcentury apartments remain one of the cheaper ways to get into hip neighborhoods, said Jaclyn B. Treinkman, an associate broker with Compass who recently listed an apartment in a stout 1959 building in Greenwich Village for $550,000. Similar but newer apartments in the area might list in the $700,000 range, she said.

“It was homey-slash-ugly,” said Devon Talbott, 30, an actor who owns the apartment with his family. The unit was configured as a studio, with red walls and dated finishes, when Mr. Talbott and his family bought it in 2007 for $465,000. But the comparatively low price, he said, allowed them to transform the roughly 500-square-foot space into a one-bedroom with two Murphy beds, a sliding partition wall and a small recording booth for Mr. Talbott, a voice actor for the Japanese animated series “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.”

The renovation, designed by Elise Kodish of Anne Zuckerberg Associates, incorporated 1960s and 1970s motifs like painted glass cabinets and a modernist chandelier hung above Macassar ebony wood cabinets with a tiger-stripe pattern. Mr. Talbott, who is now working on a horror web series called “Fear,” is selling because his family is moving to Brooklyn. But their fondness for postwar redos remains: They plan to keep a smaller studio that Ms. Kodish also revamped in a white-brick 1960s building across the street.

The postwar pedigree is a lure for others as well. The Sovereign, a 47-story tower in Sutton Place built in 1974, was designed by Emery Roth & Sons, an architecture firm known for prewar developments like the San Remo towers. Its International-style lobby — complete with Venini crystal chandeliers, iron-mesh curtains and rosewood paneling — remains largely unchanged.

In the building’s heyday, celebrities like Freddie Mercury and Calvin Klein lived there, said Jessica G. Ushan, an associate broker with Brown Harris Stevens who has sold more than 200 apartments in the Sovereign since the 1990s. The rock-star edge has dulled a bit in recent years, with more empty nesters than pop artists calling it home. But the building’s staying power is in its design.

Half the units have floor plans resembling the Classic Six or Classic Seven layouts of prewar apartments, with distinct living and dining areas and a maid’s room, Ms. Ushan said, while the other half are L-shaped, with a more modern, open floor plan. The under-nine-foot ceilings may be lower than those in most new development, but they are offset in part by the private balconies — and by the prices. As Ms. Ushan said, “It’s about half the price of a new condo.”

H.R. Vanoosten Morris, 52, a retired asset fund manager, is selling a two-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath unit in the building for $2.295 million. His husband, Neal Prince, who died in April and was an architect known for his interior design of the InterContinental Hotels, bought the unit in 1978. Mr. Prince kept the original Classic Six floor plan intact because he thought the formal dining and living rooms were ideal for entertaining. The space still has the designer’s antique-green marble flooring, mirrored walls and custom-built glass-and-metal dining table that seats at least 12, which will stay with the apartment.

Ms. Ushan said the buyer will likely want to renovate the kitchen, which is dated by today’s standards, and possibly open the adjacent pantry and maid’s room to create a larger open space. But she is not discounting the vintage appeal.

“Some things get so old, they get new again,” she said, noting that some buyers seek out retro décor with an eye to giving it a modern spin.

For other buyers of postwar apartments — particularly those built later — age is just a number.

“I guess the ’80s is a long time ago now, but it doesn’t seem like it,” said Sander Ross, a retired tax attorney. In 2014, he bought an apartment with his wife, Carol, the general counsel for a publishing company, at the Dag Hammarskjold, a concrete-and-glass condo built in 1984, for $1.775 million.

The 43-story tower in Turtle Bay, near the United Nations, was one of the first luxury condos built in the 1980s, said Richard Balzano, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman who sold the couple the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath apartment.

“It was very much ahead of its time,” Mr. Balzano said, with features like nine-foot ceilings and building amenities like a children’s playroom and an indoor pool on the top floor — unheard of today, because developers now put the most expensive units at the top of the building.

The apartment needed work. Mr. Ross and his wife raised the ceilings, which had been lowered by a previous owner to house lighting, installed taller doors and gutted most of the space, at a cost of about $400,000. “I don’t think a co-op would have allowed us to do this kind of thing,” he said.

For their effort, they got a condo with some of the amenities of a newer building at a fraction of the price. (The median cost of a 1980s apartment last year was $1.19 million, compared to $3.05 million for new construction.) The unit has a balcony that overlooks several parks, and the master bedroom has a dead-on view of the Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City. They’re not planning to sell.

For Ms. Chwals, the serial home buyer in the 1960s West Village co-op, living in a midcentury building also meant a break from new-condo monotony.

“I liked that it wasn’t the sleek, post-Carrie Bradshaw version of New York,” she said, referring to the television series “Sex and the City,” which aired in the late 1990s and early 2000s. More to the point, she thought the prewar stock in her price range was tiny and overpriced.

Over the years, she has learned to appreciate the plainness of her building, the way an artist sees a canvas. “Because it’s a box, there’s no loyalty to preserving someone’s architectural vision,” she said of the renovations that she and her husband, Walter Lee, have done.

Ms. Chwals, 37, who works for an arts education nonprofit, made her first purchase there: a studio apartment, in 2004. In 2010, she and Mr. Lee, who is also 37 and works in financial services, bought a two-bedroom. Then they bought an adjacent studio to create a combined three-bedroom home with room for their two young daughters. Now they’re selling that three-bedroom apartment, which is listed for $3.795 million with James Morgan of Compass, to move into a larger duplex in the building.

In the three-bedroom, the couple took down interior walls to create a largely open floor plan. Working with the design firm Studio g & a, they used bright wallpaper, big art and colorful carpets to decorate the unadorned space. The living and dining areas flow together, and a sliding walnut door closes off a dressing room. The windows are not floor to ceiling, as in newer buildings, but Ms. Chwals sees that as a plus: “You’d end up living with your shades drawn, anyway.”

There is also something comforting about not living in the “it” building on the block. Over the years she has become friendly with her neighbors, who range in age from young parents to retirees.

“There’s a real sense of community that I don’t think we’d get if we were in a shinier new building,” she said.",The Plight of the Postwar Apartment,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/realestate/plight-of-postwar-apartment.html

Instead, Iowa Pacific has begun leasing rail space, about 100 cars per track mile, to rail companies that want to store cars that are not needed.

Ed Ellis, the president of Iowa Pacific, said leasing space raises money needed for ongoing track maintenance and repairs.

In addition to the old mining rail line, Iowa Pacific also operates a connecting railroad, the scenic Saratoga & North Creek Railway that runs 60 miles from Saratoga Springs to North Creek, which is home to the Gore Mountain ski resort. It began operating the railway, which is used primarily for sightseeing rides, in 2011 under a lease agreement with Warren County and the Town of Corinth, which own the tracks on the scenic railroad.

Iowa Pacific, however, is responsible for maintaining all the tracks from Saratoga to Tahawus, which Mr. Ellis said costs more than $750,000 per year. Leasing storage space on the tracks, Mr. Ellis said, is a way to generate revenue to allow the company to run the scenic railway while it continues to seek customers for the rocks from the mines.

“We’re patient investors,” he said. “This is not about quarterly earnings. This is about the long-term future of railroads.”

But critics suspect that the storage deal will prove anything but temporary and oppose parking the rail cars for aesthetic reasons and also over concerns that the cars could damage the environment if they start deteriorating.

The state Department of Environmental Conservation and the Adirondack Park Agency, another state entity that regulates land use in the park, also oppose the storage arrangement. “We are seriously concerned about potential environmental impacts and are evaluating all legal and regulatory options at our disposal,’’ the agencies said in a joint statement.","Empty Rail Cars Roll Into the Adirondacks, Stirring Controversy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/nyregion/empty-rail-cars-roll-into-the-adirondacks-stirring-controversy.html

To the extent that Mr. Moore is entitled to a defense against expulsion, the Senate could initiate fitness proceedings now, before the election, to ascertain whether the accusations against him are credible; alternately, it could suspend his swearing-in until after the investigative proceedings are concluded. If Mr. Moore chose to ignore them, the Senate could simply conclude that he lacks the character and fitness to serve — as Mr. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, surely knows, failing to contest an adjudicative proceeding results in a default judgment.

The Senate has precedents for this course of action. Most recently, expulsion proceedings have been contemplated against Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, should he be convicted in his current corruption trial. And two former Republican senators, John Ensign of Nevada and Bob Packwood of Oregon, faced the prospect of expulsion for sexual misconduct, leading both of them to resign instead.

Mr. Packwood’s case is especially instructive. He was accused of serial sexual harassment that went on for years, though he was never charged with a crime. Nevertheless, in 1995, Mitch McConnell, then the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, wrote the committee’s report recommending Mr. Packwood’s expulsion for a “habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a senator.” Hours after the report was delivered, Mr. Packwood resigned.

In other words, Mr. McConnell has already concluded that credible allegations of serious sexual misconduct should preclude a person from serving in the Senate. Does he still hold this view and is he willing to act on it?

On principle and precedent, Mr. McConnell’s choice is clear. If the Republican Party is serious about preventing Mr. Moore from becoming a member of an institution that likes to bill itself as the world’s greatest deliberative body (with apologies to Westminster), it could stop the insanity now by simply declaring that, if elected, the party’s Senate caucus will move to immediately expel Roy Moore because he lacks the character and fitness to serve.

The results would be less messy than you might think. Under Alabama law, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, is supposed to appoint an interim senator and order a special election. But the law doesn’t specify a deadline for that election, which means that the state could just wait until the next regularly scheduled elections, in November 2018. That way, the Republicans, who have a narrow Senate majority, wouldn’t lose a seat, and could avoid casting a blind eye on credible allegations of sexual abuse of a minor.

Obviously, things aren’t that simple in practice; Mr. Moore’s supporters, who include Stephen Bannon and most of the conservative media, would surely fight Mr. McConnell with everything they have, and exact revenge if he succeeds. The question comes down to one of principle. The Republicans have the power to block Mr. Moore from joining them. Will they use it?","Yes, the G.O.P.

President Trump reignited controversy about Russia recently by declaring he believes that its president, Vladimir Putin, is sincere when he asserts that Moscow did not interfere in last year’s presidential election. The director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo, made similarly confounding remarks last month when he said that Russia’s campaign had failed to affect the outcome of the election, misrepresenting the formal judgment of the intelligence community. A C.I.A. spokesman later said that Mr. Pompeo had misspoken.

As former C.I.A. officers, we find both of those comments deeply troubling. But another, less noticed remark by Mr. Pompeo was equally disturbing. He said that agency officers have an obligation to remain quiet about their work for a period that “far extends beyond the day you turn in your badge.” Even if his ire was trained primarily at specific outspoken former intelligence community leaders, his message to all former C.I.A. officers was clear: Stop speaking out.

Our response to him is this: Respectfully, we won’t. As former C.I.A. officers, we would like to explain why we have decided to speak out about the troubling state of our country’s leadership and the dangerous implications for our national security.

Two of us served as analysts focused on counterterrorism and broader security issues, while another of us was an operations officer for nearly three decades. Each of us served under presidents of both parties, and we all left the C.I.A. at different times and for different reasons. We fall on various points of the political spectrum, but at least one element unites us: We joined the C.I.A. because of our love of country and desire to protect the ideals upon which it was founded.

Our loyalty oath was to something far greater, and that oath is the very reason we have chosen to be vocal.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand.
You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn.
Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections.","For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

By late May 2015, the fuel was gone and the plant shut down.

Soon after the coalition imposed a naval blockade, ostensibly to prevent weapons from reaching Houthi rebels, reducing the supply of food, medicine and fuel to a trickle. Yemen imports more than 85 percent of its food and medicine, most of it by sea.

Coalition forces turned away or stopped ships heading for Yemeni ports for weeks. Fighting around ports such as Hodeida, the country’s largest cargo port, worsened shortages.

With the treatment plant out of power, wastewater flowed down canals and into the valleys around Sana. Dirty water spread over miles of farmland. Flies hovered above the raw sewage. Cucumbers, tomatoes and leafy greens grown in the contaminated water made their way to markets around Sana. Many cases of acute diarrhea were reported.

Infusions of fuel from the United Nations Children’s Fund helped the sewage plant return to operation, but not full time. Every week bought more people displaced by war into Sana. The treatment plant was built to serve 500,000 people but began handling the waste of nearly 1.5 million. An increasing number of patients sick with acute diarrhea arrived at the Kuwait Hospital in Sana.

In October 2016, tests confirmed cholera in Sana and cases began to be reported around the country. International organizations helped set up and run cholera testing and treatment centers across the city.

War brought even more displaced people to Sana and its population increased to about three million. With no fuel, the plant closed once again in January, for 40 days. It restarted after a small power station in Sana supplied it with six hours of electricity a day. It wasn’t enough. The quantity of untreated wastewater was increasing every day.

In April, cholera was spreading with unprecedented speed across 18 out of 23 governorates of Yemen. In two weeks, more than 20,000 people had been infected and 242 killed by this bout of the disease. Unicef stepped in again to help with the sewage plant’s operation. Since May, the plant has been in service.

Cholera in Yemen is a man-made disaster, and its spread and casualties are tied to the politics of the war. Aerial bombing by the Saudi-led coalition in Houthi-held areas have damaged hospitals, public water systems and sewage plants.

More than half of health care facilities have fully or partly closed. Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers have gone without salaries for months. Sanitation has worsened. People live amid sewage. Acute watery diarrhea has been more fatal in areas controlled by the rebels than in areas controlled by the government.

According to The Lancet, 78 percent of cholera cases and 81 percent of deaths from cholera have occurred in Houthi-controlled governorates. Governorates controlled by Mr. Hadi’s government have reported 67,346 cases of cholera; the Houthi-rebel-controlled governorates have reported 339,061 cases.

The Saudi-led coalition has delayed or turned away numerous ships carrying fuel and supplies to ports controlled by the rebels. Between May and September alone, according to Human Rights Watch, seven fuel tankers were delayed or diverted.

It has eased the blockade intermittently, allowed varying amounts of fuel, food supplies and medicine. Saudi Arabia and the United States, its leading supporter in the war, have offered $236 million and $427 million for the United Nations humanitarian aid effort in Yemen in 2017. In the summer, Saudi Arabia pledged $33.7 million specifically to help fight cholera.

But severe shortages of food and medicine remain. The United Nations estimates that about seven million people are on the brink of famine in Yemen and nearly 900,000 are infected with cholera.

I was a typical beginner, even if I didn’t live in your typical neighborhood: This was the South Bronx during the era when arson and abandonment fueled by government dysfunction turned it into a globally-infamous and desolate urban landscape.

My spirit sometimes felt as broken as the sidewalks and buildings of my neighborhood on Fox Street, since I had grown disillusioned with art school and was floundering with my identity. I was a Puerto Rican and a New Yorker, but it was hard to reconcile those two identities. I struggled in New York because I wasn’t recognized as American. And when I moved to the island for a while, I wasn’t recognized as Puerto Rican, either.

Even in art school I sometimes wasn’t recognized as the one thing I had set out to be – a photographer. Luckily, one of my teachers who was familiar with my work suggested I meet a friend of hers, Mel Rosenthal, who taught photography at Empire State College.

Mel instantly liked what I was shooting, and it was fitting that we met at that time. While I was photographing the Longwood section of South Bronx, Mel was out making pictures on the streets of his youth a few miles north in the Bathgate neighborhood for images that would later be published as “In the South Bronx of America.”

Mel let me into his life, and I was alongside him when he took many of the pictures in his book. We made the connections between his youth as a Jewish man who returned to where he had grown up on the streets of the South Bronx and seeing how its current residents – my family and friends – had been disenfranchised. Mel introduced me to politics and taught me who the players were and how they were being exposed. There was the catalyst that got me thinking how I could use photography to change and document that.

Mel’s approach to documentary photography was shaped by his own strong belief in social justice, which led him back to his old neighborhood to document how its beleaguered residents confronted its decline, the impact of city policies of official neglect, or the guerilla ingenuity of Puerto Rico’s Villa Sin Miedo, a land rescue effort to provide affordable housing.

What was central in his work – and what he taught us – was that when people let you into their lives, your photographs can amplify their voices on the issues that mattered to them, despite the silence and indifference of the rest of the city and its power brokers. Under his guidance, I started making those connections between my neighborhood’s decline and the larger forces buffeting it, from political neglect and corruption to the greed of landlords who cut services and then abandoned their properties or hired people to torch them for insurance.

Photo

My work from that era was influenced by Mel’s lessons and his own example as a compassionate photographer on a mission. Sure, I took pictures of the fires, the abandoned buildings or skeletal cars dumped on the streets. But I also caught early B-Boys dancing at the Hunts Point Palace, kids playing on the streets and the other rhythms of life. And, sadly, I also have portraits of friends who would not survive much past their teenage years, their lives cut short by drugs, AIDS or guns.

I am but one of many young, socially aware photographers fortunate to have attended Mel’s seminal workshops where he introduced us to the world of documentary photography and photojournalism. The summer workshops were a six-week intensive course where some of the best photojournalists in the world shared their images of the issues of the time, from covering the wars in Central America to poverty in the middle America and around the world.

The students who attended those workshops fanned out throughout New York City covering the rise of AIDS and the birth of political activism in the gay and lesbian community, as well as protests against racism and police brutality that turned the streets of black and Latino communities into raging battlegrounds. There wasn’t a single week where there wasn’t a demonstration taking place and that was the real classroom where Mel’s students learned their craft.

Mel came into his own as a photographer during the social unrest of the 1960s. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that his former students are now photojournalists documenting very similar deep divisions that are consuming our country.

Mel died last week from the effects of Alzheimer’s, a disease that slowly and painfully took him from us. The best memorial we can give him is to continue the practice as he taught it.

President Barack Obama asked Congress for $75 billion for his initial universal preschool plan; universal preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds would cost $98.4 billion over 10 years.

Senator Bernie Sanders’s College for All Act doesn’t even require the federal government to cover the entire $70 billion cost of public college tuition, but it could if this money were available to the government. Divvying up $70 billion a year to each parent in the country would be a huge step toward ending childhood poverty. And the available pot of money, were offshore tax avoidance not an option, would be even larger if rich individuals were taxed at the rates we all face here at home.

Yet even in the face of the Paradise Papers revelations, Republicans want to lower taxes on big corporations and rich individuals even further.

Businesses and the wealthy, the Republicans’ argument goes, will bring their money back to our shores and pay taxes on it if rates are lower. But there are few mechanisms included in their tax package that would actually push either group to do so, rather than keep it abroad and away from taxation.

The House package included a new tax on intellectual property royalties multinational corporations pay to offshore affiliates in an effort, the writers say, to keep them from moving money to tax shelters. But, after an outcry from those multinationals, an amendment was added on Monday that weakens its impact such that it’s worth 95 percent less. Senate Republicans, meanwhile, haven’t included it in their version of the legislation.

The House package also calls for a one-time tax of 7 percent and 14 percent on offshore earnings that have been stockpiled abroad, and an effective 10 percent rate on “high returns” to a parent company headquartered in this country from foreign subsidiaries, both efforts to supposedly keep multinationals from avoiding taxes. The Senate version proposes even lower rates on offshore earnings. Those rates are far lower than the 20 percent rate Republicans want to levy on corporate profits — and a huge drop from the current rate of 35 percent — leaving an incentive to keep money elsewhere.

The House plan shifts the country to a territorial tax system, in which companies would owe taxes only on money they make here. Money generated abroad in foreign subsidiaries would be subject to the taxes of that country, so they’d have even more incentive to keep it in the low-tax places the Paradise Papers show they’ve already been using.

None of these provisions go after wealthy individuals who keep their money in offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes. Instead, the House package hands these same people a variety of giveaways: an enormous loophole via a lower tax rate on pass-through businesses; the elimination of the alternative minimum tax that ensures they have to pay at least something; and the eradication of the tax on the wealthiest estates.

The groups that are already dodging taxes through offshore accounting are the ones that make out with the biggest benefits. According to an analysis by the conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, $1 trillion of the overall $1.5 trillion cost is from cuts for businesses. According to the Tax Policy Center, the highest-income families can expect the biggest reward. The richest 0.1 percent of Americans will get an average $278,370 reduction in their tax bill by 2027, while the poorest two-fifths of the country get around $25.

The Republican tax plan would shift more of the tax burden onto those who can least afford to shoulder it and relieve those who are already starving the government of tax revenue.

Gotham West is one of a handful of expensive rental buildings offering excursions as the latest perk. Common, a developer of co-living housing, led New York City residents to a sleep-away camp near Lake George a few times this year. At 525 West 52nd Street, another Hell’s Kitchen rental, residents visited Storm King Art Center in Cornwall, N.Y., in September. And the Eugene, a rental near Hudson Yards, also took its residents apple picking last month.

In a sluggish rental market where renters at the top have oodles of options, the thinking goes: Shower existing tenants with unusual perks and maybe a new one will sign a lease. Post pictures of the events on social media, and prospective renters, particularly those who are new to the city and looking for friends, might take notice.

Such offerings are also a relatively inexpensive investment compared to a permanent fixture like a pet spa or an indoor pool. A field trip does not occupy valuable square footage, nor does it require expensive equipment.

On a dewy Saturday morning in October, Michael Borth, 43, a Broadway musician who went on the Warwick trip, stood in front of a row of Empire apple trees and described Gotham West as “by far the most social building I’ve ever lived in.” He shares a studio apartment there with his girlfriend, Deborah Avery, 43, also a Broadway musician.

Ms. Avery said that she was a Girl Scout the last time she went apple picking. “There are many buildings where I’ve lived next to people and never talked to them,” said Mr. Borth, who grew up in Wichita, Kan. Apparently, that’s not a good thing. “It’s very strange.”

Even so, do you really make friends on a field trip for grown-ups? Maybe it’s just a good way to make the most of that hefty $700 amenity fee and get enough apples for a pie.

Residents said the morning ride up to Warwick was quiet as riders nursed their coffees and got a few more minutes of sleep before they disembarked. When the bus arrived around 10 a.m., the group quickly fanned out, couples breaking off together and single tenants wandering alone. Within minutes, everyone had dispersed.

Sign up for the outing without a plus-one and there was a good chance you would stay that way all day. As other orchard visitors meandered past me, clutching sticky children and heavy bags of fruit, I smiled weakly. They had no way of knowing that I had come with a group. I imagined them thinking: What grown-up goes apple picking alone?

Ruth Whippman, the author of “America the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks,” likened the outing to the corporate retreat where you go bowling with the group from accounting. “Sometimes that can feel quite forced,” she said.

Yet, people are desperately seeking ways to look up from their iPhones and strike up a real-life conversation — at least 20 percent of Americans suffer from loneliness and social isolation, Ms. Whippman said. “There is a really big need for people to have new kinds of social opportunities,” she said.

But one that is choreographed might not produce the result management wants. “It’s so hard to know whether any social occasion will be a great party or whether it will be intrinsically awful where someone’s crying into their bag of apples,” she said.

The goal of these activities might be to “provide lifestyle enhancement opportunities,” as Christopher Jaskiewicz, the chief operating officer of the Gotham Organization, the developer of Gotham West, told me.

Even so, as enhancing as the day trip might be, people may not actually make friends. At best, you make some small talk until you go home. At worst, you get stuck sitting next to someone you really don’t like.

Melissa, a 38-year-old playwright who lives in a one-bedroom in Gotham West, had doubts about the trip, but she signed up anyway. “I was a little apprehensive,” she said, cradling an enormous bag of apples as we walked. Melissa asked to withhold her last name because she did not want anyone knowing where she lived. “I was worried that I would be picking apples with couples,” she said.

Instead, she spent the morning wandering the orchard alone, gathering fruit. “I got lost and I loved it,” she said. Other single day-trippers I encountered also spent much of the day on their own. While we were chatting, Melissa bumped into a cheerful woman from the building who had also come on her own. They traded pleasantries and went back to foraging for fruit.

As I bit into a crisp Winesap, I asked Melissa what she thought of other Gotham West mixers. Many of the events were geared toward singles, she said. But just because someone signed a lease to live in the same apartment complex does not mean you have anything more than that in common. “They want these events for people to meet other people,” she said. “But if you’re on your own, you just go off by yourself.”

A pitched battle certainly now seems to be underway — in hospitals and on the streets, in local assemblies and courts throughout the country.

Early this year, a major public hospital in Rome listed two job openings for gynecologists, specifying that it was seeking candidates who were not conscientious objectors. The Italian Bishops’ Conference denounced the ad as discriminatory, but a local court said it was legal. In August, an administrative court in Rome ruled that medical personnel could not invoke conscientious objection to refuse prescribing birth-control pills or withhold certificates of pregnancy, which women seeking an abortion need. Local media called the decision a “revolution.”

Almost as soon as Law 194 was passed in 1978, the Church and its political proxy then, the Christian Democratic Party, tried to have it repealed. A referendum was held in 1981, but voters rejected the idea — roundly, by a margin of 2 to 1. Having failed to change the law, the Church then set out to exploit its internal contradictions — which it had helped create.

Even as Law 194 guarantees the right to an abortion, it “recognizes the social value of motherhood.” According to Angela Balzano, a researcher in philosophy and bioethics at the University of Bologna, that built-in tension, along with “the loophole provided by the clause on conscientious objection,” was an attempt to mediate between “two irreconcilable positions” in the late 1970s: the abortion-rights agenda of the Radical Party, a leading left-wing party, and the anti-abortion Catholics. She called this “a clear case of judicial antinomy.”

Four decades later, it’s apparent who has benefited from that weakness, and this result is no accident. Pope Francis himself, speaking at a gathering of Italian Catholic physicians in 2014, encouraged doctors to make “brave choices that go against the current,” referring pointedly to conscientious objection and abortion.

Although the Christian Democrats are no longer, Catholicism remains a major political force. The religious movement Comunione e Liberazione (Communion and Liberation), whose stated mission is to promote the “education to the Christian faith” and comes under the pope’s direct authority, has thousands of supporters — some say many thousands — including in hospitals, universities and women’s clinics, and among politicians in center-right parties, like those who opposed Mr. Borraccino’s law in Apulia.

In addition to legalizing abortion, Law 194 called for establishing specialized women’s clinics. But after years of cuts to the state health care system, many clinics today are Catholic, and those refuse to provide even information or basic services to women seeking an abortion. What’s more, they are partly funded with taxpayer money: 0.8 percent of personal taxes are directly allocated to the Church, unless taxpayers specifically ask to opt out. So much for the separation of Church and state.

The law granting women access to abortion has been gutted, Assunta Sarlo, a journalist and activist with the feminist group Usciamo dal Silenzio (Let’s End the Silence), told me, partly “because the religious forces have been able to count on political allies in what remains a strongly Catholic country.” But it’s also, she said, “because the reputation of abortion is such that choosing to be a gynecologist who carries out this type of procedure is akin to career suicide.”

Opinion polls suggest that the vast majority of Italians still support access to abortion. But some three-quarters of the population also call themselves Catholic, and so even for some Italians who support women’s right to terminate a pregnancy, abortion still carries a stigma. And that’s just the kind of tension that the Church has been expert at exploiting — at a great cost to women, as well as the rule of law, in Italy.","Abortion in Italy, a Right Wronged",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/abortion-italy-conscientious-objectors.html

Because “The Band’s Visit,” which stars a magnificent Katrina Lenk and Tony Shalhoub as would-be lovers in a not-quite paradise, is like life in that way, too.

There were worries that this finely detailed show, based on Eran Kolirin’s screenplay for the 2007 film of the same title, might not survive the transfer to Broadway. First staged to sold-out houses late last year at the Atlantic Theater Company, it exuded a shimmering transparency that might well have evaporated in less intimate quarters.

Yet “The Band’s Visit” — which follows the modest adventures of a touring Egyptian band stranded in an Israeli village significant only for its insignificance — more than holds its own on a larger stage. Its impeccably coordinated creative team has magnified and polished its assets to a high sheen that never feels synthetic.

This show was always close to perfect musically. (Mr. Yazbek’s quietly simmering score, which inflects Broadway balladry and character songs with a haunting Middle Eastern accent, felt as essential as oxygen.) But it felt a shade less persuasive in its connective spoken scenes.

That is, to say the least, no longer a problem. Though the lives it depicts are governed by a caution born of chronic disappointment, Mr. Cromer’s production now moves wire to wire with a thoroughbred’s confidence.

Such assurance is all the more impressive when you consider that “The Band’s Visit” is built on delicately balanced contradictions. It finds ecstasy in ennui; eroticism among people who rarely make physical contact; and a sense of profound eventfulness in a plot in which, all told, very little happens.

The story is sprung when the members of the Alexandria Ceremonial Band, led by their straight-backed conductor, Tewfiq (Mr. Shalhoub), board a bus in 1996 for an engagement at the Arab Cultural Center in the city of Petah Tikva. Thanks to some understandable confusion at the ticket counter, they wind up instead in the flyblown backwater of Bet Hatikva.

They register as unmistakably alien figures there, looking like refugees from Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in their powder-blue uniforms. (Sarah Laux did the costumes.) And there’s not a bus out of this godforsaken hole until the next morning.

Just how uninteresting is Bet Hatikva? Its residents are happy to tell you, in some of the wittiest songs ever written about being bored. The “B” that begins its name might as well stand for “basically bleak and beige and blah blah blah.”

Leading this civic inventory is a cafe proprietor named Dina (Ms. Lenk, in a star-making performance), a wry beauty who clearly doesn’t belong here and just as clearly will never leave. Like her fellow citizens, she sees the defining condition of her life as eternal waiting, a state in which you “keep looking off out into the distance/ Even though you know the view is never gonna change.”

Scott Pask’s revolving set, so fitting for a world in which life seems to spin in an endless circle, captures the sameness of the view. But Tyler Micoleau’s lighting, and the whispers of projections by Maya Ciarrocchi, evoke the subliminal changes of perspective stirred by the arrival of strangers.

Connections among the Egyptian and the Israeli characters are inevitably incomplete. To begin with, they don’t share a language and must communicate in broken English. And as the stranded musicians interact with their hosts, their shared story becomes a tally of sweet nothings, of regretful might-have-beens.

That means that the cultural collisions and consummations that you — and they — might anticipate don’t occur. Even the frictions that emerge from uninvited Arabs on Israeli soil flicker and die like damp matches.

The show is carefully veined with images of incompleteness: a forever unlit cigarette in the mouth of a violinist (George Abud); a clarinet concerto that has never been completed by its composer (Alok Tewari); a public telephone that never rings, guarded by a local (Adam Kantor) waiting for a call from his girlfriend; and a pickup line that’s dangled like an unbaited hook by the band’s aspiring Lothario (Ari’el Stachel, whose smooth jazz vocals dazzle in the style of his character’s idol, Chet Baker).

All the cast members — who also include a deeply affecting John Cariani, Kristen Sieh, Etai Benson and Andrew Polk — forge precisely individualized characters, lonely people who have all known loss, with everything and nothing in common. A marvelous Mr. Shalhoub (“Monk”) has only grown in the role of a man who carries his dignity and private grief with the stiffness of someone transporting perilously fragile cargo.

As for Ms. Lenk, seen on Broadway last season in Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” she is the ideal avatar of this show’s paradoxical spirit, at once coolly evasive and warmly expansive, like the jasmine wind that Dina describes in the breakout ballad “Omar Sharif.”

Listening to Tewfiq sing in Arabic, she wonders, “Is he singing about wishing?” She goes on: “I don’t know what I feel, and I don’t know what I know/All I know is I feel something different.”

But the imposition of money bail has remained a thorny problem and resulted in inequities: Those who can afford to pay it often emerge from custody within days or hours of being charged, while the poor are forced to languish behind bars, at times for months or years, and face a host of collateral consequences, losing their jobs, apartments, sometimes even their children.

There are currently community funds helping to bail out indigent pretrial inmates in at least 10 cities — among them Seattle, Boston and Baltimore. But Ms. Steinberg said that she has been raising money for the national fund for about the last two years and has so far secured nearly $30 million of her $50 million goal from donors like the music industry executive Jason Flom and the billionaire business magnate Richard Branson.

The chairman of the Bail Project’s board will be Michael Novogratz, a longtime hedge fund manager who now runs Galaxy Investment Partners. In an interview last week, Mr. Novogratz said that he decided to take part in the project after learning from Ms. Steinberg that on any given night, almost 450,000 poor defendants are locked in jails nationwide without even having been convicted of a crime.

“It leaves you outraged,” he said. “Even with $50 or $60 million, we’re only going to put a dent in things and hopefully change attitudes about cash bail. It’s a monster problem.”

The Bail Project plans to deploy two experts called “bail disrupters” to each of the cities it will work in and have them serve in a partnership with local public defenders and criminal justice reform advocates to interview and discover potential clients. Aside from paying bail on behalf of the poor, the national fund, Ms. Steinberg said, will also seek to address a lack of data on the issue by collecting information on what sorts of defendants end up held on bail, as well as on the socioeconomic costs of pretrial detention.

According to one report released last month by the Prison Policy Initiative, which advocates for inmates, women who could not make bail had a median annual income of slightly more than $11,000. This month, the Pretrial Justice Institute, which studies bail and works to reform the system, released a national report card grading states on their bail programs: 17 states received F’s; only one state, New Jersey, received an A.

New Jersey is indeed among a handful of states, like Georgia, Texas and New Mexico, that have recently sought to curtail — and in some cases end — the practice of imposing money bail. But these separate efforts at reform have occasioned a coordinated pushback from the bail industry, which fears its profits are in jeopardy.

Ms. Steinberg said that 96 percent of the people in the Bronx whose bail was paid by her local fund in the last 10 years returned to court for all of their appearances. If that statistic could be replicated nationwide, she added, the national fund could exist in perpetuity as the money given to help clients close their cases returns to the kitty for future use.

Ms. Steinberg also noted that remaining in jail without paying bail can affect the results of criminal proceedings. In New York, she said, more than 90 percent of those who cannot pay bail and stay locked up until their cases are concluded end up pleading guilty. But more than half of her clients in the Bronx who were freed on bail, she said, had their cases dismissed by prosecutors once they were released.

“While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.
One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch.","While low-cost airlines like Spirit have narrowed the distance between rows of seats to as little as 28 inches, most of the big American airlines have kept the distance — what’s known in the business as seat pitch — at 30 inches. Anything less, the major airlines have found, pushes already beleaguered travelers to their limits.

This year, the news leaked that American Airlines was considering a cabin redesign that would leave a few rows in its new Boeing 737 Max fleet with just 29 inches of pitch, plans the carrier quickly dropped after a rash of complaints.

“We got a lot of pushback from our customers and, most notably, from our team members,” the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, told investors on a conference call in July. “While we could convince ourselves that that might be able to produce somewhat higher revenues on the aircraft, what it was doing to our perception with our team wasn’t worth it.”

The push to shrink the space between rows of seats comes as major carriers are squeezing 10 abreast in more long-haul jets, so that the middle section has four seats — and, by definition, two middle seats — rather than three.

But customers will be spared this experience on most flights within the United States, Mr. Aboulafia said, because there just isn’t enough space. “The good news is that pretty much every domestic flight you’re going to take is going to be in a 737 or A320 — no way can you do four-three,” he said.

Traditional airline seats were fashioned out of rigid aluminum frames, then wrapped in thick foam padding. But that approach, said Alex Pozzi, vice president for research and development in interior systems for Rockwell Collins, a manufacturer of aircraft seats, is no longer used, with the availability of more sophisticated, high-tech materials.

“We’ve been using a lot of advanced materials, a lot of composite materials, to allow the actual physical structure to get smaller,” he said. “We’ve also removed a lot of the hard points in the seat and gone to fabric suspension systems,” leading, he said, to seats more akin to ergonomic desk chairs.

“The less size that the seat structure itself takes up, the more space that’s left over for the passenger,” Mr. Pozzi said.

Or, as the case may be, for more passengers. “Over the last five years, as slimline seats become more common and were adopted by more airlines, airlines took the opportunity to basically take the space they were saving and, depending on the airline, most of the airlines took that space and added in an extra row or two,” said Jami Counter, vice president of TripAdvisor Flights, which owns the site SeatGuru.com. “The actual pitch would shrink, but theoretically, your leg room wouldn’t.”

“Now,” he added, “you’re cramming another person in there so you still have more people in that exact same space. It becomes a much more unpleasant flying experience.”

On American Airlines’ new 737s, which will be put into service beginning soon, seats have a minimum 30-inch pitch, although American says most seats have 31 inches. Seatback TV screens were eliminated and replaced with brackets that passengers can use to mount their own devices to watch video, and power sources to keep those devices running. The magazine holder is now closer to the top of the seatback to free up more knee room.

“Those seats are designed to make the best possible use of the space,” an American spokesman, Josh Freed, said.

Airlines contend that improved ergonomics and, in some cases, slightly wider seats make up for a tighter pitch. A spokesman for Spirit Airlines, Paul Berry, said the emphasis on pitch was an inaccurate way to assess today’s newer seat designs.

“If you just go by inches, it’s kind of an old measure. We’re kind of basing it on comfort level and the way we’ve engineered our seats,” he said. “While it’s only 28 inches in pitch, it actually feels like it’s about 30 inches,” he said.

But some consumer advocates say the issue goes beyond comfort. One group, Flyers Rights, is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum dimensions for airline seat width and pitch. The group won a round in its court battle with the F.A.A. in July, when a Federal District Court told the agency to address what it referred to as “the incredible shrinking airline seat.”

Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, said the need for seat regulation is driven by safety concerns. Passengers have been getting taller and wider, even as airlines push for slimmer seats, but regulations still stipulate that planes have to be able to be evacuated in just a minute and a half.

“Obviously, if you’re squeezed into a very confined space, it’s going to be harder to get up and get out in an emergency,” Mr. Hudson said.

“The seats were originally designed for people, for men who averaged about 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds,” he said. “Right now, the average man is just under 200 pounds.”

The airline industry contends that further regulation is unnecessary. Carriers referred questions to the trade group Airlines for America, which responded with an emailed statement that read, in part, “All U.S. carriers meet or exceed federal safety standards and we continue to believe that there is no need for government to interfere.”

But some air travel professionals contend that advocates like Flyers Rights may have a point in arguing that tightly packed seats may be an impediment to evacuations.

“It won’t be necessarily a passenger comfort regulation, but more around safety,” Mr. Counter said.

Mr. Harteveldt agreed. “There may be a legitimate issue around safety,” he said. “That’s why we’re now starting to see this topic bubble up.”",Air Travelers Resisting the ‘Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat’,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/airline-seat.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Cuomo, a Master of the $50,000 Fund-Raiser, Bypasses Small Donors Image Since the beginning of 2015, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has raised more than 99 percent of his campaign money from donations larger than $1,000, eschewing the small-donor model that many Democrats have lately used. Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times

At $25 million and counting, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo sits atop the largest tower of campaign contributions of any Democratic politician in America. But this monument to his prodigious fund-raising strength also reveals one of his greatest vulnerabilities, especially if he harbors presidential ambitions.

He has virtually no small donors.

Since the beginning of 2015, Mr. Cuomo has raised over 99 percent of his campaign money from donations larger than $1,000 and nearly 99.9 percent of his funds from donors who gave at least $200, according to an analysis by The New York Times. At one point last year, Mr. Cuomo went six months without reporting a single individual donor who gave less than $200.

“You almost have to try to have that few,” said Michael Whitney, who served as Senator Bernie Sanders’s digital fund-raising manager on his 2016 presidential campaign. He said that if Mr. Cuomo were to run for president and maintain his “comically absent number of small donors,” it could cripple him in an era where both parties, but particularly Democrats, have become reliant on an army of small givers to compete at the national level.

“I don’t understand how he can credibly use his current fund-raising operation and be a viable candidate for 2020,” Mr. Whitney said.

Mr. Cuomo insists he is only running for a third term as New York governor in 2018, his “dream job,” he said last week, brushing aside questions about his further ambitions.

With a 70 percent approval rating in New York City, including more than half of Republicans in a poll last month , Mr. Cuomo’s path to re-election seems smooth. Still, he is taking no chances — his bulging war chest makes him a particularly imposing front-runner.

He will add to it this week as he heads to California, with stops in San Francisco and Beverly Hills, and an itinerary typical of his big-money fund-raising calendar. Donors will be asked for as much as $50,000 to rub shoulders with the governor at the home of Jeff Shell, the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. Other boldfaced names on the invitation include the CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves; the Disney chief, Bob Iger, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder of DreamWorks Animation.

Even if Mr. Cuomo ends his 2018 re-election with a sizable surplus, he cannot use his state account to fund a potential presidential campaign because those funds are not transferable. But Mr. Cuomo’s vast network of large donors would be the envy of most politicians, and his patrons could always spend millions on an independent super PAC.

Nonetheless, the overwhelming reliance on big checks makes Mr. Cuomo an outlier even among the best fund-raisers in the country.

Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, famous for his connections to wealthy donors as a top fund-raiser for the Clintons, raised over $1 million from contributions of $100 or less in his 2013 campaign. Mr. Cuomo has raised around $164,000 in such contributions in his 2010, 2014 and 2018 campaigns — combined.

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas — a Republican who has the most campaign money in the country, $41 million — has raised over $2.8 million from nearly 75,000 contributions of $200 or less since his 2014 re-election, according to his campaign officials.

Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California and a leading Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, has one of the largest campaign treasuries in the nation, with $16 million. In the first six months of 2017, he had 34,096 donors who gave $200 or less, according to his campaign.

Mr. Newsom’s median donation during that period was $10; Mr. Cuomo’s was $2,500. Mr. Newsom raised over $668,000 from such donors, compared to roughly $5,000 for Mr. Cuomo.

“The governor has received contributions of all sizes from thousands of supporters, and these varying donations help bolster his strong progressive agenda to improve the lives of all New Yorkers.” said William J. Mulrow, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign chairman. “We look forward to building on that record in the third term.”

Mr. Cuomo’s campaign account has grown by over $23.6 million since the start of 2015 but only roughly $30,000 came from individual donors who gave less than $200, the federal threshold for disclosure.

“Small-dollar fund-raising and online fund-raising has been a nonnegotiable for both Obama campaigns, for Bernie and Hillary,” said Betsy Hoover, the director of digital organizing for President Obama’s 2012 campaign. “It’s hard to imagine what a serious presidential looks like that doesn’t get that kind of buy-in and participation from a broader swath of donors.”

In the first six months of this year, Mr. Cuomo raised over $5 million, but reported fewer than 100 total small donors who collectively gave less than $5,000. Over that same period, Mr. Cuomo earned far more in interest and dividends on his deposited donations; over $100,000 was paid on June 30.

“It shows who he does appeal to — which is powerful, vested, moneyed interests,” said Stephanie Miner, a Democrat and the mayor of Syracuse who is contemplating challenging Mr. Cuomo in a primary.

If she were to run, Ms. Miner said her campaign would follow “the Bernie Sanders, Howard Dean, Daily Kos model” of seeking small contributions online.

Mr. Cuomo has long resisted investing capital to create a formidable digital footprint for his campaigns, according to past advisers.

His website is badly outdated. The link to volunteer is broken (the page also currently echoes President Trump’s slogan: “Governor Andrew Cuomo is fighting to make New York great again”). People who sign up for email updates do not get a welcome message, or any emails at all sometimes for months.

“Governor Cuomo set out a transformational plan to restore New York to greatness and has spent three and half years making that plan a reality,” his home page says.

Mr. Cuomo has been governor for nearly seven years.

“Politics changed in the last few years and Andrew Cuomo hasn’t shown that he’s noticed,” said Zephyr Teachout, the then-little-known professor who challenged Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination in 2014. “The deep, legitimate anger at big corporate monopolies is not something Andrew Cuomo understands. In fact, that’s his donor base.”

Past and present advisers to Mr. Cuomo say the governor has long been in his element wooing the wealthy for large checks. In September, he hosted a fund-raiser at Madison Square Garden during a Paul McCartney concert.

In December, Mr. Cuomo is throwing a birthday fund-raiser that will feature former President Bill Clinton and a performance by Jon Bon Jovi. Top-tier access to the event, which includes a private reception with the governor, will cost $50,000.

Mr. Cuomo did hold a relatively rare “grass-roots” event last Thursday at Hudson Terrace in Manhattan with $100 tickets and a “limited number” of $50 spots available.

One reason small donations are so critical for federal races is the far more restrictive giving limits. Presidential candidates can only raise money in $2,700 increments for the primary; in New York, Mr. Cuomo can raise up to $65,100 for his re-election.

Joe Trippi, who served as campaign manager for Mr. Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign, which pioneered raising smaller contributions online, said Mr. Cuomo still has the time and resources to cultivate a small-donor network.

“The requirement to do that is a message that energizes people and they’re excited about,” he said. “We haven’t seen that from him yet.”

Mr. Cuomo has a long way to go to catch up to past presidential contenders’ small donor programs.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Hillary Clinton’s campaign raised 18 percent of its funds from donations less than $200; Mr. Obama raised 32 percent of his funds from such donors in 2012. Mr. Sanders raised 87 percent, according to his campaign.

Mr. Cuomo? Just above 0.1 percent.

“You would think, having watched the last three presidential cycles, that if he’s serious about that, that will change,” Mr. Trippi said. “It’s almost like when he updates the website that’s when you know he’s running. Instead of his first trip to Iowa the sign might be, hey, I got an email!”

You know that terrifying moment when you hear your voice crack, and it’s crystal clear that, no matter how hard you fight it, the next syllable out of your mouth will be wrapped in a sob?

Well, that’s how my meeting with former Vice President Joe Biden began.

After 18 months of pestering his office for an interview for my “Table for Three” series at The Times — to talk about the death of his elder son, Beau, in 2015, and how we somehow manage to go on after monumental losses — he finally said yes. Except the piece would now be for the Book Review, because in the time I’d spent asking, Mr. Biden had written a book on the subject. His new memoir, “Promise Me, Dad,” will be published on Tuesday.

For me, the secret pleasure of interviewing people like Mr. Biden is preparing to interview them: diving into their press coverage and writing, hunting for clues about the men and women behind their public images, so that in my limited time with them, I can bring a fresh picture to life. That meant reading everything I could find about Mr. Biden, of course. But I also waded into the world of grief memoirs, books about personal tragedy and loss. I read an elegant pair by Joan Didion, “The Year of Magical Thinking” (about the death of her husband) and “Blue Nights” (on the death of her daughter). And I revisited a poetic heartbreaker, “The Light of the World,” by Elizabeth Alexander, whom I interviewed with Sheryl Sandberg six months ago about the deaths of their husbands and parenting through grief.

With these books and Mr. Biden’s life story in my head, I created a mission for my interview: Why would anyone put himself through the misery of reliving the most painful moments of his life?

Thus armed, I traveled last month to Mr. Biden’s home in a leafy neighborhood of Wilmington, Del.

President Trump reignited controversy about Russia recently by declaring he believes that its president, Vladimir Putin, is sincere when he asserts that Moscow did not interfere in last year’s presidential election. The director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo, made similarly confounding remarks last month when he said that Russia’s campaign had failed to affect the outcome of the election, misrepresenting the formal judgment of the intelligence community. A C.I.A. spokesman later said that Mr. Pompeo had misspoken.

As former C.I.A. officers, we find both of those comments deeply troubling. But another, less noticed remark by Mr. Pompeo was equally disturbing. He said that agency officers have an obligation to remain quiet about their work for a period that “far extends beyond the day you turn in your badge.” Even if his ire was trained primarily at specific outspoken former intelligence community leaders, his message to all former C.I.A. officers was clear: Stop speaking out.

Our response to him is this: Respectfully, we won’t. As former C.I.A. officers, we would like to explain why we have decided to speak out about the troubling state of our country’s leadership and the dangerous implications for our national security.

Two of us served as analysts focused on counterterrorism and broader security issues, while another of us was an operations officer for nearly three decades. Each of us served under presidents of both parties, and we all left the C.I.A. at different times and for different reasons. We fall on various points of the political spectrum, but at least one element unites us: We joined the C.I.A. because of our love of country and desire to protect the ideals upon which it was founded.

On our first day at C.I.A. headquarters, we raised our right hands and declared that we would protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Nowhere in that oath — or any of the reams of paperwork we signed — did we pledge to defend a specific president or a particular political party. Our loyalty oath was to something far greater, and that oath is the very reason we have chosen to be vocal.

We are most alarmed by the current administration’s continued denial of Russian interference in the presidential election, despite the high confidence judgment of the intelligence community to the contrary.

Whip-smart and unassuming, with meticulous handwriting and an erstwhile fondness for Tetris, Ms. Jones seems suited to a new era — of transformation but also of restraint — at Vanity Fair and Condé Nast.

“In Radhika, we are so proud to have a fearless and brilliant editor whose intelligence and curiosity will define the future of Vanity Fair in the years to come,” Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue and Condé Nast’s artistic director, said in a statement.

A compendium of culture high and low, politics and distinctive visuals, Vanity Fair was resuscitated in 1983, after a 47-year absence, to add some swank and intelligence to the Condé Nast stable in the days before the company had purchased The New Yorker. Its pages have featured the combative essays of Christopher Hitchens, the dishy features of Dominick Dunne and the high-production portraits of Annie Leibovitz — but the magazine has also remained a holdout as its publisher looks to become leaner and less tied to its print titles.

Mr. Carter has said he mulled leaving the magazine earlier this year but for the election of a longtime foil, Donald J. Trump. (The magazine saw a spike in subscriptions after Mr. Trump tweeted last year that the magazine was “Way down, big trouble, dead!”) He had balked at Condé Nast’s belt-tightening and resisted efforts inside the company to consolidate its design, research, photo and copy teams.

It was not a good time at Condé Nast, or anywhere else in the cash-strapped magazine industry, to scoff at cost-cutting. The company expects to bring in $100 million less in revenue this year than it did in 2016, and it is in the middle of laying off 80 employees. This month, it said it was reducing the print frequency of titles like GQ, Glamour and Architectural Digest and shuttering the print edition of Teen Vogue.

To follow Mr. Carter’s long run, executives sought an editor who could carry on Vanity Fair’s journalistic traditions and travel seamlessly between the spheres of Hollywood, Washington and New York. At the same time, the new editor would be charged with taking the title beyond its printed form — and with fewer resources — according to an executive briefed on the selection process.

Guessing Mr. Carter’s replacement became a parlor game at media industry parties. Among the names that surfaced were Adam Moss, the editor of New York magazine; Janice Min, who revitalized Us Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, a columnist at The New York Times and a host of CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

The decision was ultimately up to Robert Sauerberg, the chief executive of Condé Nast, who oversaw the search along with Ms. Wintour. David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, was also heavily involved.

It was Mr. Remnick who brought in and championed Ms. Jones, the executive said, and she eventually won over the others.

“We didn’t need a name for the sake of a name or a celebrity,” Steven O. Newhouse, a nephew of the late Samuel I. Newhouse and a top executive at Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications, said in an interview. “We really wanted someone who could do the job and be a worthy successor to Graydon, and I think we found someone.”

“She has vision and energy and a very active mind,” Mr. Newhouse added, “and I think that’s what Vanity Fair needs.”

Ms. Jones was the only candidate Mr. Newhouse met.

A product of Ridgefield, Conn., by way of New York and Cincinnati, Ms. Jones graduated from Harvard College and received a doctoral degree in English and comparative literature from Columbia University. She has lived in Taipei and Moscow, where she got her start in journalism as the arts editor at The Moscow Times, an English-language newspaper. (Her Russian, she said, is rusty.)

Many editors in her position would proclaim their love of magazines, particularly the one they are about to sit atop, but Ms. Jones was characteristically candid.

“It’s hard for me to exactly figure out when I became obsessed with magazines,” she said.

Did she read Vanity Fair growing up?

“On and off,” she said.

She declined to describe her plans for Vanity Fair. “I need to get oriented first — there’s a lot to take in,” she said. She also demurred when asked about any writers she was considering. “I’m just really interested in discovery,” she said.

Ms. Jones, who joined The Times last November, is not the first person to make the move from Times books coverage to the top editorial position at Vanity Fair. In 1981, as Condé Nast announced its plan to revive the Jazz Age title, it appointed Richard Locke, an editor at The New York Times Book Review, to run it. “We take risks,” Alexander Liberman, then Condé Nast’s editorial director, said when asked about the selection.

Mr. Locke was replaced by a Condé Nast veteran, Leo Lerman, four issues into his run.

Those who know Ms. Jones believe she will thrive, citing her academic background as well as the breadth of her interests. Before she joined The Times, she was a deputy managing editor at Time magazine, where she transformed the Time 100 franchise into an eclectic mix of celebrities and unheralded visionaries. After the issue’s corresponding annual gala, she would host an all-night karaoke party at a Midtown dive. At The Paris Review, the literary quarterly able to make a young writer’s career, she served as managing editor.

“She once referred to herself as a ‘formerly shy person,’ as someone who had to learn how to speak out,” said Nancy Gibbs, who recently stepped down as the top editor at Time. “She doesn’t come on incredibly strong. She doesn’t overpower you with her ideas — she’s a different kind of presence.”

In his quarter century at Vanity Fair, Mr. Carter parlayed its editorship into elite social status. A party host, producer of documentary films and Broadway shows, political commentator and restaurateur, he became part of the celebrity fabric. On his watch, Vanity Fair’s annual post-Oscar party became one of the year’s most glittery, star-studded affairs.

It is perhaps inevitable that Ms. Jones will invite comparisons with Mr. Carter, just as he had to live up to the expectations of readers who had grown to love the version of Vanity Fair created by his predecessor, Tina Brown. Some in the media world are already scrutinizing her experience for signs she will not measure up, particularly when it comes to Mr. Carter’s ability to navigate Hollywood.

Her supporters reject any notion she will not succeed on every level. And in case anyone was wondering, yes, she will preside over the 2018 Oscar party.

“The reality is, she has incredible credentials to direct a magazine that’s so focused on culture,” Mr. Newhouse said.

“I think that she’s fully capable of all the elements of Vanity Fair,” he added. “Obviously, you don’t start out — as Graydon didn’t start out — the way that Graydon ended up.”","Radhika Jones, Vanity Fair’s Surprise Choice, Is Ready to Go",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/radhika-jones-vanity-fair.html

On the streets of Manila, meanwhile, a phalanx of about a hundred riot police officers with shields and truncheons clashed Monday with about 300 protesters as they marched near the American Embassy.

The protesters carried anti-American placards and a likeness of Mr. Trump with a Hitler-like mustache. They were later pushed back with water cannons.

White House officials have said that Mr. Trump has a “warm rapport” with Mr. Duterte, with whom he has spoken and exchanged letters since taking office, and that he wants to mend the American-Philippine alliance after strains during the Obama administration.

“President Trump specifically said he has always been a friend of the Duterte administration, unlike the previous administrations of the United States,” Mr. Roque said on Monday. “He stressed that he can be counted upon as a friend of the Duterte administration.”

Mr. Trump raised eyebrows in April by inviting Mr. Duterte to the White House during what American officials called a “very friendly conversation” on the phone in which the president praised the Philippine leader’s efforts to rid his country of drugs.

Mr. Duterte has been accused of ordering thousands of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in what human rights groups condemn as a bloody campaign that has targeted many who may have nothing to do with narcotics.

On Sunday evening, he made a public show of his affection for Mr. Trump, grabbing a microphone during the gala dinner to sing the Philippine love ballad “Ikaw,” a serenade he said he had performed “upon the orders of the commander in chief of the United States.” A Philippine official later tweeted about the song, reportedly a favorite of Mr. Duterte’s, which includes the lyric, “You are the love I’ve been waiting for.”

Mr. Trump’s encounter earlier in the day with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia was somewhat scratchier, albeit in a mostly playful way. As the two leaders stood alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, Mr. Trump repeated his vow to eliminate trade deficits that he said the United States ran with “almost everybody.”

“Except us,” Mr. Turnbull interjected.

“Except with you,” Mr. Trump agreed, to titters in the room. “You’re the only one. And if I check it, I’ll probably find out that was …”

“Oh, no,” Mr. Turnbull said. “It’s real.”

The United States, in fact, has run a $10.3 billion trade surplus with Australia in the nine months of this year and has consistently exported more to Australia than it has imported for the last decade.

Since taking office, Mr. Duterte has pivoted away from the United States, a longtime treaty ally, and toward China. The separation took on a more personal flavor before last year’s meeting of the group, known as Asean, in Laos. Then Mr. Duterte used a slur to refer to President Barack Obama when he was asked how he would react if Mr. Obama raised human rights concerns with him. The episode prompted Mr. Obama to cancel a formal meeting with Mr. Duterte at the summit meeting, though the two did talk informally.

Still, Mr. Duterte continued to distance himself, calling for a “separation” between the countries and threatening to scrap an agreement that allows American troops to visit the Philippines.

Trump administration officials have said Mr. Trump wants to improve relations with the Philippines as a bulwark against China’s expansionism in the South China Sea. The Philippines has clashed with China over disputed reefs and shoals in the waterway, which the two countries share, and Mr. Trump has used this month’s Asia tour to offer to, as he said on Sunday in Hanoi, “mediate or arbitrate” such disagreements.

But neither side mentioned the issue in their readouts of the meeting on Monday, and Mr. Duterte has played down the disputes this week, saying that China’s rapidly expanding economy has overtaken that of the United States and that a territorial confrontation would not be worthwhile.

“Today, China is the No. 1 economic powerhouse, and we have to be friends,” Mr. Duterte told Asean leaders on Sunday.

He said that while “the other hotheads” would like confrontation, “the South China Sea is better left untouched.”

Chris Boot, the executive director of the nonprofit Aperture Foundation spoke with James Estrin about the state of photography and its future. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Q.

Aperture was started by Minor White with Beaumont and Nancy Newhall, Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams, among others, but it quickly became Minor White’s baby, right?

A.

It was Minor and a few others that became the initial editorial board. But Minor was the driver, it was made in Minor’s apartment. It was Minor who was the key character. And then it was Michael Hoffman, who had been Minor’s assistant, who became the driving force.

Q.

Aperture was founded to promote art photography partly in response to photojournalism becoming dominant in the mid-20th century. What does the phrase “art photography” mean?

A.

Well, I can speak a little bit to what I think they meant. It meant photography pursued with an artistic consciousness that wasn’t created to serve the purpose of information. Personally I think that we’re all artists in different ways. I don’t get into the divisions between where a true artist begins and ends and the rest of photographers take over.

Everybody is creatively invested.

My sense is that the founders were reacting to what Steichen was doing at the Museum of Modern Art, and what Life magazine was doing.

Q.

To a large degree in the 19th century there was not really this hard wall between art photography and non-art photography. In many ways that came into being more in the 20th century.

A.

I never subscribed to that myself. I don’t think it’s very meaningful.

It certainly is important for a lot of people at the point that photojournalism was crumbling by the end of the 1990s. So there was this dominance and rise in the ’40s, but by the end of the ’90s it was dying — well certainly as a livelihood if not as an art form. A lot of photographers did not want to be tarnished with the brush of journalism because they thought that would harm them in their career.

“You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.” — Chris Boot

At Aperture, I’ve tended to use the word photographer or artist, more often interchangeably, but not to use photojournalist, nor the term “fine art,” which was a term that Aperture used in its early days.

The photographers that I’ve always worked with have used the sort of model of the artist — meaning you self-assign and you drive your own subject. You make the pictures that you want to make and you’re not defined by a client or a number of clients.

Even the Magnum photographers who were doing assignments here and there were really working in the manner of an artist. They were picking their major topics, they were driving the work where they wanted it to go

Q.

Aperture was started really before photographs were a commodity. There were no galleries.

A.

You could buy Westons for 20 bucks.

I think by the ’70s there were a few galleries, but there was no appetite or audience for the photographer as artist. You could compare photography to a kind of cult: There were a few true believers who understood each other, but the rest of the world didn’t get it. Obviously as a cult, it’s been tremendously successful because now a lot of people got into it.

It seems to me that if you’re going to be an organization of photography at this point in time, then it’s no longer the kind of cult thing. You’ve got to deal with what photography is in its breadth.

Q.

So you’re interested in looking at all photography?

A.

We’re interested in how photography is shaping who we become. So it’s really identity, society and how we look and relate to each other, as well as what particular artists have to contribute to those ideas.

When I started at Aperture in 2011, it was the beginning of Instagram.

The technological revolution with the shift to digital with all kinds of different tools available was underway, but the social media revolution was just beginning.

Q.

In a sense, photography is now everywhere and everything.

A.

It’s not photography alone — but photography has this particular role, especially in isolating the individual, of giving us access to templates of who we might be. I mean, the most obvious expression of that is in fashion. You see a picture and you imagine that you could present yourself like that — you could be stronger, you could be more effective and you’d feel better about yourself. We can’t imagine our future selves without being able to see pictures first.

Day to day that’s what’s happening on our own Instagram feeds. We’re all contributing ideas to each other about how we evolve. And it turns out to be a very fertile moment for that, despite what we might think of as pessimistic circumstances.

Photo

Q.

You worked at Magnum, and you’ve published many documentary books. How does one straddle both the documentary world and, for lack of a better term, the art world?

A.

I went into Magnum having come from a politics of representation and theoretical perspective. I wanted to be involved with a group of people who were really looking at the world and thinking of what was going on in the world. In a way they were less that than I thought they would be.

When I came to do books, the language that I was comfortable with was the documentary language, but I was interested in documentary innovators. When I was publishing books, what I was comfortable with was a kind of documentary practice which you could describe not very usefully as a documentary art practice. It wasn’t journalism, although it spoke to what was going on in the outside world rather than just in the artist’s imagination.

Look at LaToya Ruby Frazier’s first book Aperture published. She’s using a fairly traditional language, but she’s presenting her work in a very personal and political context and in a particularly powerful way, I don’t think photographers used to be that bold. We are all a lot bolder, which is great.

Jess Dugan was in our summer open with a series of portraits of elders in the transgender community. I asked if this was a special moment to do this kind of work and what Jess said was so powerful and so direct, “This is the moment not to hold back any of our truth, and that’s truth in pictures and truth in ourselves.”

This is a great kind of outpouring of all the things we have to say, and I feel like people aren’t holding back in a way that we used to. And part of that is how the narrative of most artists has become personal.

The common language of photography was a language of detachment and observation and certainly of the Magnum crowd. If you were a photographer like Cartier-Bresson, many pictures may have been utterly personal, but his point of view, the position that he took, is completely detached.

Q.

Being the observer.

A.

Now, the personal and the political and the observational are all bundled, and that all began with Nan Goldin, I think. She took the traditional language of photojournalism but made herself and her medium her own subject and then had tremendous success.

I think that shaped everything that came ever since and you almost lack credibility at this point if you are just an observer watching something or seeing something from outside. There’s got to be more to it than that, you’ve got to be more invested in it, and I guess that applies to a lot of the photographers we’re publishing. They are their stories.

Q.

So let’s talk about books. What is it that you hoped to accomplish when you came to Aperture from your own publishing company and what is the role you see of book publishing at Aperture?

A.

Aperture is a venerable brand and there are many people whose first real encounter with photography was through the pages of the magazine or Dianne Arbus’s first book. It had these roots that were appealing to me.

Everything about the world was changing. Everybody can be a publisher now. And I felt ill equipped as a solo publisher to navigate this incredible environment. Aperture was somewhere I could bring all my skills and be able to engage in this rich new environment of e-books and different channels of publication.

Photo

We tried to shift the position of Aperture from being one publisher competing among others to being a not-for-profit photography organization that supported this incredible world of independent book making that was going on

We initiated the PhotoBook Review, which is a kind of newspaper for the book making field, and the Paris Photo Aperture Book Awards.

It was the intention from the beginning to carve a clear middle path, be distinct as a not-for-profit publisher, be distinct as an artist-oriented publisher known above all for books that we make with artists, as well as cultivate and support and help identify and learn from this, the best of this incredible bookmaking field emerging around us.

Q.

How do you decide what books Aperture should publish?

A.

One thing I’ve learned from my years in publishing is, the only books that work and are successful are books that are driven by a passion to the point of compulsion on the part of a commissioning editor. A belief that the world is a better place because this book exists.

I never tell my staff what books to do. They decide. We all discuss the economics and whether this adds to who we are and fits sensibly into our programs. But one characteristic of every book that we do is that it is driven by some editor’s passion.

Secondly, there’s a type of book we do that other publishers can’t do because they make no economic sense. I would say for the most part those are the artist books. They are really true collaborations with artists, they’re usually selling relatively low numbers, but they have major effects on the artist’s life and career.

Other books that we do that are more consumer-oriented, we like to think of as smart interventions in the consumer marketplace. It’s really important what we do there. They may not in many cases be that different from what other publishers are doing. But it’s important for how we develop our brand that we treat every single person out there as potentially interested in the story of photography and get them if we possibly can. Whether that’s through the children’s library or the bookstore at the Met or wherever we can get them.

Q.

What differentiates Aperture?

A.

We’re about presenting work in context. We have a responsibility to help the reader understand the context of the social history of the work.

We do not differentiate ourselves with pictures in the magazine. There are many beautifully made picture magazines out there. We differentiate ourselves with words, meaning that it’s the work that we put into commissioning text that intelligently and accessibly provides readers an understanding of what’s going on. We are editors, writers, and photographers, not just photographers.

Q.

Why is this important? Isn’t a picture a picture?

A.

When Aperture began, there were very few pictures in the magazine. It was mainly about words because part of what was missing from the field was a sophisticated discussion about photography.

There wasn’t anywhere encouraging people to think and write about photography – no language to talk about photography. That’s one of the reasons why those artists in their cults were not understood: because people didn’t know how to talk about the work.

Q.

Who is your audience? Photographers, curators, educators? Has it changed?

A.

The core is the same, photographers, curators, people who need to know what is going on in photography. We often think of the audience of the magazine as being people who are serious about photography. You have to make a certain level of commitment to following what’s going on, to pay for it, to want it every time.

The number of people who are serious about photography has grown exponentially.

What we’re doing now is different than what we were doing 10 years ago.

Q.

How?

A.

Then it was more like a kind of general interest magazine authored by great photographers and writers. And it had great success as that.

Historically, our average subscriber is kind of 50-plus and a man with a decent salary. And we like them. But we’re trying to bring a youthful, more diverse audience in as well.

We have been I think a pretty exclusive club that turns out to have been an exclusive white club though we didn’t think of it that way. And we don’t want to be that anymore. I don’t think anybody does, and that’s good.

We don’t take our existing audience for granted, but we know who we’re going for. We meet the people that we want to be subscribers, 30-something culturally engaged people who are politically engaged too, artistically aware. We’re trying to build our younger, more diverse audience.

I do think we’re all very aware of what we have not been in the past, what we should have been in the past. We’ve all got some making up to do. I think I can speak for everybody that I work with that there is this complete conviction and a sense of joy, too, about this. There’s so much to do.

Donald doesn’t back Ivana up then or afterward, but rather is displeased that she didn’t knuckle under: “Why didn’t you just have a friggin’ steak?” “Raising Trump” also provides a window into Donald’s pettiness when he pulls on Ivanka’s ski pole during a family race down the slope in order to win — cheating to beat his own young daughter!

Meet Marla Maples, the mistress Ivana refers to as “the showgirl.” Ivana divulges nothing of what was said in the heat of the ensuing battle with her husband back at the chalet, one of the many frustrating cloth-drops over the parrot cage in this book. The marital rupture inflicted a string of indignities on Ivana as the New York tabloids engaged in dueling headlines, the most infamous being Maples’s “Best Sex I Ever Had” boast on the front page of The Post. With her faint air of Zsa Zsa Gabor and madcap aplomb, Ivana aerated Trump’s persona during their marriage — gave his brash, crass excess a dash of dynasty dazzle and camp. Once their partnership was sundered, Ivana took her blithe esprit and comic malaprops to enjoy the high life elsewhere (“In 2006, my yacht was parked at Cannes for the film festival, and I was having a party with two hundred people on it”), a pity since she might have been a more inspiriting first lady than the inscrutable, animatronic Melania. As someone who grew up in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and witnessed Russian tanks crushing the Prague Spring, Ivana would have been more sensitive and perhaps even resistant to Russian interference than our current White House has been. Hurt and humiliated as she was by Donald’s infidelity, however, Ivana remains a loyalist, proclaiming, “I believe he’ll be a great president,” perhaps the first in a family dynasty. Of Ivanka, she suggests, “Who knows? One day, she might be the first female — and Jewish — POTUS.” I’vana throw up.

The subtitle to Jerry Oppenheimer’s “The Kardashians: An American Drama” evokes the panoramic scope and muted trumpets of a Ken Burns epic, but crack open the book and the whiff of cheese is unmistakable. It’s almost comforting knowing that we are in the able, busy hands of a veteran journeyman with few pretensions to subtlety, scene-painting and the stately march of history. The author of biographies of the Clintons, Rock Hudson, Anna Wintour, Martha Stewart, Barbara Walters and other two-legged notables, Oppenheimer doesn’t doodle around — he hacks away. The prologue kicks off with a classic bit of ooga-booga involving a Christian prophetess who told the then-obscure lawyer Robert Kardashian that, in his words, “one day my name, the Kardashian name, would be known around the world.” And, lo, the curse came to pass. On June 17, 1994, the day that the white Ford Bronco chase covered live from coast to coast entered American lore, Robert Kardashian — friend, legal defender and personal exculpator of the former football great and “Naked Gun” co-star O.J. Simpson — read aloud his client’s rambling letter of professed innocence concerning the slashing homicides of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman to a locust swarm of international press. He was identified on TV screens as “Robert Kardashian, Simpson Friend,” and from that moment the “Kardashian” name has become pop culture’s most persistent rash. Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob and their half sisters, Kendall and Kylie … all those freaking Kardashians, but the K who counts the most is, of course, Robert’s then-wife, Kris: Kristen Houghton Kardashian and the future Kris Jenner — schemer, dreamer, mother, impresario and “cougar extraordinaire.” It was she who would convert Kardashian from an instant household name into a self-perpetuating media brand and meme.

It can’t be said that Oppenheimer is in Kris’s corner as she bops her way to the top. Even as a high schooler she’s tagged as a “shallow opportunist,” and the chapter where the teenage Kris meets her first lover, a 28-year-old professional golfer, is titled “Hole in One.” Her marriage to Robert in 1978 would have been a parodic misalliance under balmier circumstances. For most readers, Ira Levin’s 1972 best-selling novel “The Stepford Wives” was a satire and cautionary tale; for the future Mrs. Kardashian, the 1975 thriller movie it inspired was a training manual. While dating Kris, Robert insisted that she listen to instructional audiocassettes to stock the bare pantry of her mind with knowledge, mistakenly assuming she would be an obedient helpmate. Unfortunately for this, Kris’s favorite mini-series was “The Thorn Birds,” that passion-tossed ’80s show about forbidden love in the kangaroo outback.

Despite these premarital misgivings, they wed and dutifully reproduced, but this Beverly Hills housewife was never going to relegate herself to hostess duty. Living large and spending big, Kris outfitted herself with fake boobs after seeing Nicole Simpson’s new pair (“I thought, I want two of those, please!”), and cheated on her husband with a young soccer player (“You can be a good mother and still be a tramp,” as one interested bystander puts it, words to live by). Divorce follows, and Robert Kardashian’s life becomes one sad, long, dribbling anticlimax. Basking in the celebrity glory of membership in O. J.’s dream team, after the shocking acquittal he found himself shunned, mocked and blackballed, and a couple of marriages later he died at age 59 from esophageal cancer. Meanwhile, Kris flourishes still, her subsequent union with the former Olympian Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn) supplying a second-stage booster rocket to the Kardashian brand.

Kim’s infamous sex tape with her then-boyfriend Ray J provided the initial liftoff. Modestly titled “Kim Kardashian, Superstar,” it surfaced in 2007, the same year that the reality series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” debuted on E!, executive-produced by the inescapable Ryan Seacrest and with Kris presiding as the “momager” of this ever-expanding family enterprise. One sympathizes with Oppenheimer as he tries to keep track of all these loose marbles, but his chronicle of the Kardashian Kids carries unpleasant racial overtones to which he appears tone-deaf. He mentions Khloe’s marriage to “the 6-foot-10 black pro basketball player Lamar Odom,” cites Kim’s divorce from Damon Thomas, “the first of her three African-American husbands,” and later circles back to Khloe, who “apparently had a real thing about romancing giant-size African-American hoop stars” (my agog italics). Composing himself, Oppenheimer covers the controversy over the Kardashians’ appropriation of black culture and iconography, as epitomized by Kim’s bare-backsided cover shot for Paper magazine (the one that “broke the internet”), but by then it’s too late in the book to be affecting a furrowed brow and going all Charlie Rose on us.

In the epilogue, Oppenheimer notes that all is not ducky in Kardashiana. The ratings for “Keeping Up” (now in its 14th season) are eroding and Kardashian mugs on the covers of slick magazines have become newsstand underperformers. During Fashion Week in 2016 Kim was robbed of $11 million-worth of jewelry by masked gunmen who broke into her Paris hotel suite and left her gagged — a crime that aroused suspicion that it was all a publicity stunt (it wasn’t, according to follow-up reports) and a hardy chorus of schadenfreude across social media. Oppenheimer floats the scenario that the wily Kris has one last shazam! act to pull: a daredevil leap for the biggest prize of all, the presidency. Citing Trump’s 2016 victory, he draws the obvious, dreary parallels between their reality-TV roots and social media reach, and explains that Kris and her family “have a big following among young African-American men, a bloc that eluded Trump, and have huge support among millennial women 18 to 34, and support in the transgender community — especially if Caitlyn, a staunch Republican, plays ball and stumps for her ex-wife if she, indeed, runs for elective office as she’s suggested.”

Please, stop. First Ivanka’s name is floated, now Kris’s, as if the most powerful office in the shrinking free world is a glorious bauble awarded after long devotion to celebrity, self-enrichment and the family brand, public service be damned. Why keep feeding their ravenous egos? Shouldn’t their brazen success be enough for them? It’d be nice if the first woman president were someone who’d actually done some good.","In ‘Raising Trump’ and ‘The Kardashians,’ Two Portraits of Modern American Matriarchy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review/the-kardashians-jerry-oppenheimer-raising-trump-ivana-trump.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

American Airlines, which was featured in a YouTube video of a mother and flight attendant arguing over a stroller in April, has no plans to use body cameras. There, the message to employees is to de-escalate conflicts.

A memo the airline’s chief executive sent to employees after the stroller incident told them to take a moment to breathe, and ask for help. “A service interruption we can handle, but it is much harder to explain viral video content that is inconsistent with the first-class service you all have made American known for.”

Videos of confrontations between airline workers and passengers have occasionally resulted in financial settlements, as when United pulled David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., physician, off an airplane so they could use his seat for an airline employee. (United says it is not considering equipping its crews with body cameras.) But the case has encouraged other air travelers to threaten staff members with their cellphones.

“People are putting their phone up, saying, ‘You better book me on the next flight.’ They’re trained to intimidate our crew members using their phone,” said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American.

At the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, a union that represents nearly 27,000 workers at American Airlines, the national president, Bob Ross, said airlines needed to protect the privacy and security of flight attendants by enforcing policies limiting what passengers can photograph.

“I’m asking flight attendants to take their full names off their uniforms,” Mr. Ross said, adding that the union would ask the airline to provide name tags with just a first name or a name of the flight attendant’s choosing.

“Passengers are putting their names on social media and private-messaging them and harassing them over the fact that they lost their luggage or a flight was delayed,” he said. “These are real threats that have just gone out of proportion over the past year, and how do you stop it?”

Flight attendants at American and elsewhere are threatening to make their own videos to level the field.

“We have had the topic come up after the Dr. Dao event,” said Taylor Garland of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents workers at 19 airlines. “There is much to consider on the issue,” she said in an email statement later. “Any change to conditions in the cabin requires careful consideration.”

The comedian and podcaster Marc Maron has become one of the most prominent performers to reckon publicly with the admission by Louis C.K. that he had engaged in acts of sexual misconduct with several women.

In Monday’s installment of his WTF podcast , Mr. Maron talked about a New York Times report in which five women spoke about past experiences when Louis C.K. masturbated in front of them, asked if he could masturbate in front of them or was heard masturbating while he spoke on the phone. Following this report, Louis C.K. said in a statement , “These stories are true.”

[The Times Report in Which Five Women Speak Out]

Mr. Maron, a friend and colleague of Louis C.K.’s, said on his podcast that he was aware of at least one of the incidents detailed in the Times report. But when Mr. Maron asked if it was true, he said Louis C.K. had denied it.

“Sadly, I knew what most people knew,” Mr. Maron said. “There was a story, out there, I guess going back several years. That there were unnamed people in the story. It took place in a hotel room in Aspen. It was always out there, but then it would pick up momentum at different times.”

Describing his conversations with Louis C.K., Mr. Maron said: “I would say, ‘This story about you forcing these women to watch you jerk off — what is that? Is that true?’ He goes, ‘No, it’s not true. It’s not real. It’s a rumor.’”

“And I would say, ‘Well, are you going to address it somehow, to handle it, to get out from under it, whenever it shows up?’” Mr. Maron continued. “He goes, ‘No, I can’t. I can’t do that. It’ll give it life. It’ll give it air.’ And that — that was the conversation. The other incidents, how would everybody know about that?”

Mr. Maron said larger institutional problems in comedy made it difficult for women to be heard and believed when they spoke of being mistreated by other performers.

He said that he knew Rebecca Corry, one of the women who spoke to The Times, “and she couldn’t tell me about this.”

“There was no place for them to go with these stories, where they felt safe to tell them,” Mr. Maron said.

“I want to believe women, but in this particular instance, there was no one named in that story,” he said. “There was no place for women to go tell this story. There was no women attached to it. I didn’t know their names until Friday. So I believed my friend.”

Separately, Abby Schachner, another of the women who spoke to The Times, wrote in a Facebook post that she forgave Louis C.K. and accepted what he had said in his statement.

Ms. Schachner wrote: “Louis put out a statement, which frankly, made me cry. It touched me. And I do feel some of his insights speak to how I felt. I looked up to the people who recognized my work and made them (sigh), father figures/mentors whether they wanted that role or not. I shot myself in the foot, protected myself when I needed to be bold, was ‘bold’ when I should’ve been ‘poised’, hid behind ex-boyfriends, excuses, and the excuse of my excuses. I felt like I disappointed anyone who ever believed in me. But most of all, I never truly valued myself.”

Ms. Schachner said that Louis C.K. “did abuse his power.”

“And yes, obviously he has a ‘glitch,’” she continued. “But I do, too. We all do. We’re learning a new language here, and we need to be kind, and we need to be open, and we need to be fair, and we need to listen.”

She concluded by writing: “I do forgive Louis. I forgave him. But most of all, I think it’s time to forgive myself, too.”

Other women who spoke to The Times had different reactions to Louis C.K.’s statement. The comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov wrote in a Twitter post , “It was a statement not an apology. Don’t get it twisted.”

And a woman who worked at “The Chris Rock Show” with Louis C.K. when he masturbated in front of her, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she also felt his statement fell short. “A real apology would be a personal apology,” she said.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service took over the case in late September from Army criminal authorities after the status of the two Navy commandos was changed from “witnesses” to “persons of interest,” meaning officials were trying to determine what the commandos knew about the death and whether they were involved.

The Navy SEALs’ potential role threatens to tarnish SEAL Team 6, the famed counterterrorism unit that carried out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Until now, the biggest unanswered question in the case has been why Sergeant Melgar was killed. But new clues are emerging on that front.

An American service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said he was under the impression that the sergeant had stumbled on some sort of money-skimming scheme involving the Navy commandos. A retired senior enlisted sailor who served in SEAL Team 6 said Sergeant Melgar discovered the scam and threatened to report the Navy commandos to the authorities. Sergeant Melgar’s suspicions were first reported in the Daily Beast.

Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the sergeant’s death remains under investigation. A spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Ed Buice, declined to comment on the homicide investigation.

Special Operations troops from a range of units can earn qualifications that let them recruit sources for intelligence and pay them. These individuals may handle payments from small cash bags up to storage lockers filled with currency.

Cash from funds to pay informants has a way of going missing, military officials said. Skimming money from funds, which in Mali could be as much as $20,000 at any given time, is relatively easy because the service members are often dealing with sources who are illiterate and cannot sign their names to a receipt. This allows an unscrupulous person to create a bogus receipt with the equivalent of an “X” for a signature, military officials said.

One of the first missions to draw broad public attention to the secretive Navy SEAL Team 6 unit was its dramatic rescue in April 2009 of Capt. Richard Phillips after Somali pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama cargo ship. Snipers from the unit’s Red Squadron shot and killed three of the pirates in a small rescue boat.

The criminal complaint against the surviving pirate, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, describes how Captain Phillips gave roughly $30,000 in cash from the safe aboard the Maersk to the pirates, money that soon disappeared. Captain Phillips later recalled leaning against a sack with the money inside on the lifeboat. When Navy personnel searched the lifeboat, all they found were guns, ammunition, cellphones and radios. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service gave the SEALs polygraph tests about the missing money but could never prove where the $30,000 had gone, and the case was closed. No SEAL from that mission is involved in the Mali case.

Much is unknown about what happened around 5 a.m. June 4 in the house that Sergeant Melgar shared with another Army Green Beret and the two Navy commandos.

The SEALs were in the country on a clandestine mission to support French and Malian counterterrorism forces battling Al Qaeda’s branch in North and West Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as smaller cells aligned with Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The Americans helped provide intelligence for missions, and had participated in at least two such operations in Mali this year before Sergeant Melgar’s death. Over all, about two dozen American troops operate in Mali at any given time, mostly to help on training and counterterrorism missions.

SEAL Team 6, formally known as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, has over the past decade carried out kill-or-capture missions in Libya, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, as well as the one that killed bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.

According to one version of events surrounding the death in Mali, from a military official, one of the SEALs put Sergeant Melgar in a chokehold. When the sergeant passed out, the commandos frantically tried to revive him. Failing that, they rushed him to an emergency clinic, where he was pronounced dead.

The service member who knew Sergeant Melgar said that the sergeant’s chain of command immediately grew suspicious when the initial incident reports said the death was the result of a drunken accident. His friends and superiors knew Sergeant Melgar did not drink.

One of the SEAL commandos under investigation is Petty Officer Tony E. DeDolph, a former professional mixed martial arts fighter, according to two military officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. His identity was reported by The Intercept.

Petty Officer DeDolph and the second Navy commando, who has not been identified, were flown out of Mali shortly after Sergeant Melgar’s death and were placed on administrative leave at the unit’s headquarters in Dam Neck, Va.

Sergeant Melgar, a graduate of Texas Tech University who joined the Army in 2012, was assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., the same unit whose soldiers were attacked by a much larger and heavily armed group of Islamic State fighters near the border between Niger and Mali on Oct. 4.

Sergeant Melgar, a native of Lubbock, Tex., was about four months into what military officials said was a six-month tour in Mali. He was part of a small crisis-response team in Bamako assigned to help provide intelligence about Islamic militants in Mali to the United States Embassy to help protect its personnel against attacks. The sergeant also helped assess which Malian Army troops might be trained and equipped to build a counterterrorism force.

“The distinguished accomplishments of Staff Sergeant Logan Melgar’s are in keeping with the highest honors and traditions of military service,” read the citation with a Defense Meritorious Service Medal awarded to him posthumously.",Navy SEALs Investigated in Green Beret’s Death Also Under Scrutiny in Theft,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/navy-seals-green-beret-death-mali.html

Even under that relatively more lenient standard, close to half of patients did not meet blood pressure goals, said Dr. Eric Peterson, a professor of medicine at Duke University.

“A lot of it is inertia,” he said. “We accept higher blood pressures way more than we should.”

But few risk factors are as important to health. High blood pressure is second only to smoking as a preventable cause of heart attacks and strokes, and heart disease remains the leading killer of Americans.

“If the guidelines are implemented, they will have a big impact,” said Dr. David Goff, director of the division of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

The guidelines suggest starting drug treatment with the aim of getting blood pressure below 130/80 for anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade. Simply being age 65 or older qualifies as such a risk if their blood pressure is higher than the new standard.

Younger patients at risk include those with conditions like established heart disease or diabetes. The new standard will apply to them, as well.

People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, and to take medications if necessary to do so.

But the Avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. Some of the numbers are big. Florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to Avalere; North Carolina $13 billion.

The Medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention. Strong evidence suggests states’ expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals. Studies also show that Medicaid coverage has helped low-income Americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.

Research has found that the Medicaid expansion does not appear to discourage low-income people from working. More speculative articles have suggested that the influx of federal dollars may help strengthen state economies, though there is little hard evidence of such effects.

Governors in expansion states have argued that the money has been particularly helpful in helping residents battle addictions to opioids.

A recent study found that, in the early years of the expansion, there were no hidden costs to state budgets — and that states spent no more on their programs than states that declined to expand. In some states, it appears that expansion has improved state finances, by reducing the need for programs that pay doctors and hospitals directly for uncompensated care, among other ancillary effects. There is evidence that Medicaid expansion has lowered insurance premiums for middle-class residents who buy their own insurance.

Some states are likelier to come out ahead than others. Benjamin Sommers, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who studies Medicaid, said Wisconsin, for example, might actually save money over all if it accepted federal expansion dollars.

But legislators and governors in the holdout states have consistently opposed the expansion, citing a range of political, ideological and fiscal concerns. One big issue, experts say, is the expansion’s link to Obamacare, a law that Republicans have vowed to repeal from the beginning. “It’s made it very hard for them to turn around and embrace one of the only optional parts of it,” said Matt Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, who has closely watched the debate. “There is ample evidence from the states that have done it that there is substantial benefit.”

Some state officials also object to a program that provides benefits to poor residents who don’t work. Studies have shown that the large majority of expansion beneficiaries are working, in school or caring for a sick family member. But the Trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to condition coverage on “community engagement activities,” a policy change that could interest some reluctant politicians.

For some states, finding 10 percent of the dollars may be a challenge. David Dzielak, the Medicaid director in Mississippi, a state that has not expanded, said raising even a small fraction of the funding would be hard, especially after recent corporate tax cuts. The Avalere numbers suggest that the 6 percent of Medicaid expansion costs that Mississippi would need to pay if it expanded next year would represent less than 1 percent of its 2016 general fund spending.

“It’s all about the money, really, and our state is so poor that we can’t even afford the 10 percent for the expansion,” he said. “That’s really the bottom line.”

But not every state that has expanded its program has been wealthy, and some of those have been red states. Louisiana, for example, expanded Medicaid last year, providing health coverage to around 430,000 people, despite limited fiscal capacity and state budget challenges. Some of the largest coverage gains have come in poorer states, including West Virginia, Arkansas and Kentucky.

Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs. She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources. “It’s so much revenue,” she said. “That’s when you know we’re not dealing with dollars and cents.”

Medicaid expansion states could keep growing. Voters in Maine last week approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid. And recent legislative gains by Democrats in Virginia could change the politics of the issue there. Activists in other states, including Kansas, Utah and Idaho, are mobilizing for a renewed expansion push in the coming year.

***

The Avalere estimates are rough, but they show what would happen if each state’s expansion resulted in a decrease in the uninsured rate among low-income residents that is similar to the average decrease in states that have already expanded their programs. The model then made adjustments for the size of the poor, uninsured population, and the different costs of providing Medicaid care in different states.

In the states that have expanded already, there has been a wide range of effects. The uninsured rate among the eligible population declined by only half a percentage point in Massachusetts, which already had very broad insurance coverage. But it declined by more than six percentage points in Louisiana, where there were many more poor residents who lacked coverage. The average reduction was 2.5 percentage points.



Most of the states that haven’t expanded are likely to reap more federal dollars than these estimates if they expand, said Mr. Sloan, but analysts felt the average number was a useful, conservative estimate. (That means that our figures may also understate the amount of money that states would need to spend, too.)

Our budget numbers are for the fiscal year 2016, and come from a recent survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers. In evaluating the budget impact of the federal share of Medicaid expansion, we compared estimated federal spending with total state budgets, including current federal dollars. In evaluating the state share of the expansion funding, we compared the numbers to state general funds, to give a sense of how the program would compare with functions that the state raises its own funds to cover. State budgets typically grow by around 3 or 4 percent a year, said John Hicks, the association’s executive director, so our percentages may slightly overstate Medicaid expansion funding as a share of state budgets.",What Red States Are Passing Up as Blue States Get Billions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/upshot/what-red-states-are-passing-up-as-blue-states-get-billions.html

Earl Lucas, 47, is the chief exterior designer at the Lincoln Motor Company, in Dearborn, Mich.

Q. What is your day-to-day like?

It’s different every day. I interface with multiple disciplines, whether it be packaging, engineering, marketing or public relations. Some days I am at my computer designing digitally. Then I might be in our studio seeing that image converted to a clay model, and later as a fiberglass version of it. Another day I go to our wind tunnel, where we test aerodynamics to make sure we have the right drag count to get the best fuel economy for our product.

A. Did you always want to be an automobile designer?

I always knew I wanted to do something with design. I studied industrial design focusing on jewelry — rings, pendants and earrings — for two years at the College of Creative Studies in Detroit. The college also happened to have an outstanding automobile design curriculum. After taking one class in that program, I was hooked. It turns out the principles of designing a ring are the same as designing a car.

What or who were your early design influences?

I would have to start with my mother, Vessie Lucas, who is an interior decorator. She taught me to think abstractly — of what could be — at an early age. I read a lot of comics, like “The Mighty Thor” and “Spiderman.” I also watched cartoons such as “Speed Racer,” “Battle of the Planets” and “Star Blazers.” In terms of cars, I loved my grandfather’s 1984 Continental Mark VII, with two tones of blue paint and an impeccable white interior. After he died, I got to drive it on Sundays to church.

What considerations influence your design concepts?

I try to reflect the personality of the brand. In the case of Lincoln, our cars embody effortless luxury. We think of our car as a friend. We convey that through form, shape, color and texture. The most influential design element may be the front grille. It has to stand out but be in proportion with everything else. The centerpiece is our logo — called the Lincoln Star — which was developed in the 1950s. I have managed to tweak it a little.

What do you envision for auto design in the future?

Autonomous cars — driverless automobiles — are the future and we are already developing technologies to accommodate for this shift, which we predict could be in effect by 2030. As highways and streets will be modified, cars will also have different shapes and silhouettes; they may look more like living rooms.

The 2016-2017 figures, though, revealed that first-time international students dropped 3 percent, indicating that the decline had begun before President Trump took office.

Particularly hard hit are campuses in the Midwest, according to the institute.

At the University of Iowa, overall international enrollment this fall was 3,564, down from 4,100 in 2015.

Downing Thomas, the university’s dean of international programs, said that some other schools in the Big Ten are also experiencing declines, and none are seeing the rapid increases of the recent past.

While Iowa primarily lost Chinese students, the University of Central Missouri experienced a sharp decline this year in students from India, said Mike Godard, vice provost for enrollment management.

In the fall of 2016, the Warrensburg, Mo., university had 2,638 international students. This fall it has 944.

Dr. Godard said fewer students came from India partly because of a currency crisis in the country, but also because of concerns about the Trump administration’s travel ban affecting Muslim countries. India was not on that list, but Dr. Godard said many of the university’s Indian students were from Muslim areas of the country and were concerned about the ban.

“Although India wasn’t listed as one of the countries, certainly feeling welcome and safe and all those things is important,” he said. “It would be naïve to say that wasn’t a contributing factor.”

Prospective students from India — interviewed shortly after last year’s presidential election — have expressed fears about the racial climate in the United States, concerns that might have been heightened after the shooting death in February of an Indian engineer in a suburban Kansas City bar.

A breakdown of declines by country was not yet available for fall 2017.

In fall 2016, the sharpest drops nationally from a year earlier involved students from Brazil and Saudi Arabia, which cut back on funding international scholarships.","Fewer Foreign Students Are Coming to U.S., Survey Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/fewer-foreign-students-coming-to-us.html

Webber不少大学会要求你在高中最后一年提交入学申请时，就早早选好专业。然而，你的想法很有可能会改变。教育部说，约有30%的学生至少会换一次专业。学生们会得到大量关于选专业的建议。盖洛普(Gallup)9月的一项调查显示，大多数建议都来自于家人和朋友，仅有11%的学生会从高中顾问那里寻求指导，28%的人会从大学顾问那里寻求建议。而且，大多数人都不觉得这些建议特别有用。原因可能在于，许多关于专业的惯性思维都是错误的。误解一：STEM（Science, technology, engineering, mathematics，即科学、技术、工程、数学）总能让你赚大钱。计算机科学和工程确实占据薪酬榜首，但具体专业内的薪水差距还是很大的。“学生和家长们很清楚哪种专业的薪水最高，但他们对这些专业内部差异的程度没什么概念，”天普大学(Temple University)研究学术界收入的经济学副教授道格拉斯·A·韦伯(Douglas A. Webber)说。他举了一个例子：英语专业四分之一收入最高的人群一生中挣到的钱，要多于四分之一收入最低的化学工程师。但如果你拿不到最高的薪水呢？和一般毕业于商科和STEM领域的学生相比，就连那些终身收入水平仅高于其专业中等水平的英语或历史系毕业生也算不错的。商科是最受欢迎的大学本科学位，拿该专业的中等终身收入水平来说，一般商科毕业生一辈子能挣286万美元。当你把商科毕业生和那些人们眼中的低收入专业放在一起比较时，就会发现，那些在自己领域内薪酬略微高于中等的人，和商科毕业生比起来挣得差不多。比如，收入位列第60百分位的英语专业学生一生能挣276万美元，同样排名的心理学专业学生能挣257万美元，历史专业学生则能挣264万美元。误解二：女性要掌控一切。如今的大学校园里，女性明显占大多数，构成今年秋季入学学生的56%。和男性相比，她们成功毕业的可能性也更大。但乔治城大学教育与劳动力中心(Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce)一项将于今年晚些时候发表的报告显示，在选专业时，女性往往会把自己局限在报酬较低的领域，比如教育和社会服务。看看那些收入最高的领域，以及女性学习这些专业中的比例，就可以说明问题：商业经济(31%)、化学工程(28%)、计算机科学(20%)、电气工程(10%)、机械工程(8%)。“就算在高等教育的每一个阶段都占据优势，女性仍然无法赢过男性，”乔治城大学该中心主任安东尼·P·卡内瓦莱(Anthony P.

为什么要钻到一个领域里，而不是先体验完大学提供的各式课程，比如出国学习、俱乐部活动，或者一门出人意料的选修课？

加州大学洛杉矶分校(University of California, Los Angeles)的一项全国性调查显示，在入校时认为自己不会换专业的学生中，20%的人在第一学年结束后选择了一门新专业。

换专业可能会浪费你一两个学期的时间，尤其是当你选的新专业与你第一次选的专业无关的话。为了降低这种风险，亚利桑那州立大学(Arizona State University)、佐治亚州立大学(Georgia State University)以及布朗克斯区的莱曼学院(Lehman College)等几所大学创立了“元专业”(meta-majors)，也就是一个更大的学术门类下的数个专业组合。

“我们已经不再试图让学生们在入学时选专业，”佐治亚州立大学负责招生管理和学生成功的副教务长兼副校长蒂莫西·里尼克(Timothy Renick)说。

取而代之的是所有新生都从七个元专业中选择一个专业，它们代表着更大的学术和工作领域，比如商业、教育和STEM。第一学期，学生们聚集在学习社区里，在这个元专业范围内选择一组普遍教育课程。这样的课程设计是为了让学生们了解该领域不同专业之间的差异。

“商业元专业的学生可以了解金融、会计、管理和营销的区别，这样他们就可以在知情的前提下选择自己的专业，”里尼克博士说。他们通常会在第一学年结束后选择专业。

误解六：你需要一个专业。

印第安纳大学(Indiana University)和州立埃弗格林学院(Evergreen State College)等大学允许学生无视正式的专业列表，设计自己的学习课程。时报的纵横字谜编辑威尔·肖茨(Will Shortz)在印第安纳大学设计了自己的课程——谜语学。

“专业是人为设置的，具有限制性，”麻省理工学院(Massachusetts Institute of Technology)的系主任克里斯汀·奥尔蒂斯(Christine Ortiz)说。她目前选择暂时离职去设计一所新的非赢利大学，它将不设专业，也没有课堂或教室。

“专业是从大学的学术架构中衍生出来的，与经典学科相关联。没必要受这种束缚。它们没有考虑到那些跨学科的新兴领域。”

专业往往滞后于职场的变化。难怪只有不到三分之一的大学毕业生从事的是与自己的专业相关的工作。天普大学的韦伯表示，根据当前的工作需求选专业是有风险的，尤其是如果这种职业受到自动化威胁的话。

“我反对主修会计，”他说，“以及任何可以通过电脑编程取代的学科。”

The rest of the world should be asking ourselves why the lives of African girls and women remain so cheap.","Since the 1980s, tens of thousands of girls from the area around Benin City, in southern Nigeria, have been taken to Italy, where they are forced into prostitution. Over the past three years, according to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration, Italy has seen a nearly 600 percent increase in the number of potential sex-trafficking victims arriving by sea. Last year, 1,100 Nigerian girls made the trip; some 80 percent of them are thought to be trafficking victims.

Because of its geographic centrality and proximity to Italy, Libya is a frequent way station for refugees and victims of trafficking traveling from the Middle East, sub-Saharan and East Africa to Europe. Since the country was plunged into chaos after the toppling of Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, warring factions have taken to profiting off these vulnerable people.

Conditions are terrible for all refugees, who are typically held in detention centers under the authority of the Tripoli-based government. But they are by far the worst for those with black skin.

In Libyan cities, West African men and boys are bought and sold in broad daylight in modern-day slave markets. Migrants with certain skills, like tiling or painting, fetch a higher price. Women and girls are not sold in these markets because they are expected to arrive in Europe ready to work as prostitutes.

Africans with darker skin are taunted and derided as “burned” by Libyan smugglers. Men are beaten and forced to work in unbearable construction jobs for no pay. Aid workers told me that they often see sub-Saharan Africans who make it to Europe or who escape Libya and try to return to their home country with burns and cuts from the torture they’ve endured. Women sometimes arrive pregnant after being raped in Libya.

Those Africans who make it to Italy arrive in a country where name-calling and verbal attacks on even the most prominent black people, like politicians and athletes, is commonplace. Italians accuse Africans of stealing jobs and of all being thieves, rapists, prostitutes and drug dealers.

“Here in Italy, a lot of people think Africans are coming for work, not to escape horrible situations or because they have no choice,” Mr. Rotunno said.

Distinctions by policymakers between “economic migrants,” typically believed to be Africans, and “refugees,” like those fleeing Middle Eastern conflicts, don’t help. All people who flee their homes need help; the choice is no choice.

Tens of thousands of women who have been trafficked from Benin City have remained nameless and faceless to much of the world for decades. But back home, they are known: A 2003 United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute report concluded that “virtually every Benin family has one member or the other involved in trafficking either as a victim, sponsor, madam or trafficker.”

“There’s a lot of misinformation about what opportunities are in Europe,” Federico Soda, the Mediterranean director of the United Nations migrant agency, told me. “People know there’s something better, are seeking it and taking massive risks to try and achieve it, but nobody sets out with the worst possible scenario becoming reality.”

Italian politicians often blame smugglers for migrant deaths. But in the past year, they have enacted policies that have made it much more difficult for migrants to safely reach the country. Italy has struck deals with tribesmen who control Libya’s southern border; persuaded militias to keep boats from leaving Libya for Italy; promised local Libyan leaders money to replace profits from trafficking; and led a campaign to keep nongovernmental humanitarian agencies like Doctors Without Borders from saving people in the sea — all to ensure that fewer migrants get to Europe.

It’s working. Arrivals in Italy of migrants by sea have plunged from 181,000 last year to 114,000 this year. But at what cost? Policies enacted by the Italian government, many backed by the European Union, make the continent’s leaders as culpable as the traffickers who put the young women on the boats in the first place.

The rest of the world should be asking ourselves why the lives of African girls and women remain so cheap. Within days of the 26 bodies being found, Mr. Rotunno told me, 13 others were discovered in the Mediterranean, including that of a 3-year-old.

It’s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible.
Today’s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks.
The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen.
There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place.","Technically speaking, self-driving cars are already here. But in even the most optimistic scenario — given their persistent difficulties with situations as simple as a snowy day — robot drivers will remain wildly outnumbered by human drivers for the foreseeable future. Autonomous cars can’t change the world until they’re a major presence on the road.

Call it 20 percent: the day, if it ever arrives, that one out of five vehicles you encounter will be driving itself. In some ways, the 20 percent era is harder to imagine than the fully automated era, because this supposedly unstoppable and frictionless technology will still be embroiled in a total mess. The best, safest models will most likely come with the highest price tags, out of reach for those with average incomes. Coexistence between human and robot drivers will be uneasy at best; road rage against the machine will boil over. One catastrophic accident could still imperil the whole experiment, no matter what the overall statistics show.

But that inevitable mess is precisely what makes the one-in-five future so interesting to ponder. It’s the first point, give or take, when it will be clear that a true self-driving future is even possible. When car companies will actually be able to rip out the steering wheels from some models, designing them in entirely different ways. When big trucking firms and car services like Uber will have begun to remove drivers from their vehicles. When hypercommuters will trust their cars to drive them three hours to the office while they sleep. When you might risk putting your child in one, alone.

Will We Need A License To Ride? In 2008, I rode in a Stanford University VW Passat called Junior on a closed course in New York. Like a lot of beginners, it moved haltingly, with great caution; its minders in the front seats kept a close watch. But the moment felt transformative. Driving, burned since adolescence into my muscle memory and sensory apparatus, was being executed without my (or any human) involvement. I felt like a ghost in the machine. The autonomous vehicle went from test-track prototype to showroom reality far faster than I envisioned, propelled as much by advances in sensors and A.I. as by a collective hype cycle that seemed intent on willing these devices into existence, whether society was ready for them or not. Sitting with that “beginner” driver in 2008, as engineers closely observed its movements, took me back to that life-defining moment of getting a driver’s license. In my wallet, sparse with a library card and a school-lunch ticket, the license had real heft. It represented a primordial entry point to adulthood, a vast expansion of social possibility. As a rite, the driver’s exam — I have failed it in two countries — is a ritual by turns (three-point, of course!) tedious and terrifying. If you can summon nothing else of the 1988 teen comedy “License to Drive,” you can still see James Avery’s gleefully malevolent D.M.V. examiner, wielding his famous coffee cup. Once autonomous technology begins to really take off, will the driver’s license, and the pedagogy behind it, go the way of the stick shift? Will the ability to drive begin to seem some exotic, rarely necessary skill — like starting a fire with a flint? After all, in a vehicle that meets the Level 5 automation criteria of SAE International — “full-time performance by an Automated Driving System for all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions” — there would seem to be little point in possessing this vestigial skill. We don’t require people entering elevators, riding in airport trams or letting Roombas loose upon their living rooms to be able to take over operation in case of machine failure; it’s hard to see why our interaction with this automated technology should be any different. Our learning process could be as quick and dirty as it is with other high-tech products: Toss out the instruction manual and watch someone do it on YouTube. But this possibility, driver made passenger, broaches new territory in jurisprudence. With no licenses, what is the legal basis for restricting anyone — tweens, the elderly — from being ferried about? Young farm kids’ driving the family truck seems as obsolete as tail fins, but what’s stopping kids from being driven? Could children, often more adept at handling the smartphones of their parents than their owners are, have an advantage on older drivers less accustomed to technology? Yet the same fears that keep parents from letting their children walk to school may prevail over the allure of their autonomous vehicle handling the school run. It seems hard to say whether autonomous vehicles would hasten or delay the passage to adulthood. And as drivers interact with semiautonomous vehicles in the long run-up to Level 5, driver education and licensing, far from becoming obsolete, may become more important, argues John D. Lee, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Automation has a strong tendency to surprise people with unexpected behavior,” he says. Knowing what your car is doing — and when to take over — could be more vital than merely knowing how to drive. That water on the road — is it a surface puddle, or a veritable lake filling a gigantic pothole? That truck ahead with the dangerously swaying load — do you speed up to pass it? Is the pedestrian by the marked crosswalk waiting for you to yield or simply checking his iPhone? “Driving and managing the automation that is helping you drive,” Lee says, “are two quite different skill sets. Automation-management skills need to be learned as much as driving skills.” Tom Vanderbilt is the author of “You May Also Like” and “Traffic.”

Empty-Car Surfing Driverless cars will sometimes need to move around the city with no humans in them at all — en route to pickups or drop-offs. As empty moving vehicles become a common sight, they’re sure to enable an annoying off-label use: a flowering youth subculture of external joy riding, similar to subway surfing. All over the country, bored teenagers will lurk on the roadside, waiting to leap onto the roofs of empty cars, hanging on for as long as they can. The surfers will take advantage of advances in cloaking technology to help them confuse the cars’ sensors. Some will develop a clever assortment of grips and attachments to help them stay on, although the best among them will sneer at those who need to use tools. Fatalities will be inevitable, and often gruesome. To keep the kids off, car owners will try to coat their cars in slick repellents; these will be effective but too messy to be practical. Soon, dealers of autonomous cars will offer optional rows of spikes similar to those we already use to keep homeless people off benches. Once again, design will become more hostile in the name of safety. Rollo Romig is a journalist based in New York.

New Frontiers in Mobile Leisure Just two months ago, the House unanimously passed a bill that would allow self-driving cars to be largely exempted from the safety standards that for decades have constrained the design of automotive interiors. There are only so many places you can bolt seatbelts to the car’s frame, after all. But once autonomous technology matures, some models will be made so much roomier that they will become rooms. A high clearance and thin frames will mean getting in without bending down. All the impedimenta of front seats — the jutting dash, the steering wheel and pedals, the high center console with a stick — can fold away. You’ll be able to swivel in your chair like a captain in “Star Trek.” Liberated from having to watch the road, commuters’ eyes will be free to — what else? — consume video content. Sound’s hold on drive time — first with terrestrial radio, then satellite radio, then podcasts — will gave way to sight. But what kind of videos will we watch? If Marchetti’s constant holds (this is the idea that as transportation technology and urban planning change, people contort their lives to keep their commutes to an average of one hour per day), they will be not feature films but TV shows and short videos of the kind being increasingly produced for Facebook and YouTube. Podcasts will be displaced by vodcasts. Media companies are already negotiating with carmakers about how to price their offerings. Should in-car entertainment work more like cable or like the on-demand system in a hotel? Like Netflix or like Roku? Most riders who play games will use their phones. But by the time one in five cars is autonomous, console makers will develop specific products for it. The nearly two hours a day of console gaming played by some 60 million Americans will tick up accordingly. Swarms of commuters hitting the morning and evening roads in waves will become swarms of druids or mercenaries in massively multiplayer online games, some of which might come to incorporate the driving experience itself, a Pokémon Go for the highway. It seems less likely that we’ll use this opportunity to steal time back from screens. But if there’s enough space for a table, maybe commuters will sit around it playing poker or telling stories. Cars are, indeed, the most private places we have, sealed shut, out of earshot. (The writer Nicholson Baker has said that he likes to write while in a car parked in a shady spot.) Chris Anderson — formerly the editor of Wired, now the head of a drone-data company and, in his spare time, of a racing league for autonomous cars — says the question of what we’ll do inside self-driving cars always comes up at cocktail parties. It always confounds him. “We have this world,” he says. “It’s called the back seat of an Uber.” We already know what passengers do in back seats, be they in a limo or an R.V. or a tour bus: They pull out their phones or their iPads, or they talk to one another, or they take a nap. Why should we think that not having a driver will change anything? In an essay for Real Life magazine titled “Perpetual Motion Machines,” Chenoe Hart argues that we miss something when we think of autonomous cars this way, as a difference in degree, not in kind. Because we won’t have to worry about driving, vehicle interiors can expand to a point where we’ stop thinking of them as vehicles: They might have fully functional kitchens, or gyms, or beds. Instead of going to the coffee shop, the coffee shop might come to you; instead of going into the garage to pull out your car, the garage will be the car. The ability to summon spaces like this, Hart writes, will turn the built environment into a kind of random-access memory — with every destination equally accessible from anywhere. Whether it drove to you or you to it will be irrelevant; motion will be so smooth and constant as to be imperceptible. Hart argues that when travel becomes fully autonomous, we will always be traveling: families or co-workers in quiet concert on giant roads, moving in a cluster of moving buildings, chasing good weather, hardly aware that we’re going anywhere at all.

The Autonomous-Car Workout Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing. A harness could allow squats on a balance ball. Ceiling straps would enable a classic pull-down exercise. Interiors could include exercise bikes with harness clips. This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors. Dashboard resistance straps would allow mid-ride rowing.

This upper-body chest fly would require straps anchored to the windows and doors. There’s never enough time in the day to exercise, but perhaps the solution is in our cars. “A self-driving vehicle could definitely make a great gym, because it’s rigid all over,” says Marko Vujicic, an engineer and a partner at NPD Team, a company that consults with exercise-equipment manufacturers about machine designs. “That rigidity theoretically allows you to use every plane of the car against which to apply resistance. Your car becomes a full weight room on wheels.” It’s not as straightforward as it sounds. For one thing, the vehicles would not be freed from the laws of physics. Should your car abruptly brake while you were, for example, running on a treadmill, the treadmill would cease moving forward — but you wouldn’t, at least until you hit a windshield or door. It might be easier to remain seated. “The car could have special pockets all over the place that hold resistance bands of different strengths,” says Bryant Johnson, a personal trainer and the author of “The Ruth Bader Ginsburg Workout.” “You could use those to get a full-body strength-training workout.” Throughout your commute, your future car could scrutinize your efforts, says Steve McCauley, the head of health services for the Wynn Las Vegas resort, with fingertip monitors or other sensors tracking your heart rate and the composition of your sweat. But realistically, many of us will use our salvaged commuting time otherwise. In tomorrow’s cars, the area beneath the hood may not be needed for a combustion engine, Vujicic says — but it will remain, for reasons of mechanical stability and safety. Fitted with some padding and a safety belt, it becomes a napping cave. Gretchen Reynolds is the Well columnist for the magazine.



Limin Hee on Learning From Singapore If self-driving cars start to make up a significant portion of urban traffic, they’re likely to push cities to become more populous and compact, with fewer owned vehicles and more car sharing. The future, that is, would look more like Singapore, one of the world’s densest cities, whose government in recent years has tried to curb car ownership and ease congestion problems. We reached out to Limin Hee, the director of research at Singapore’s Center for Livable Cities, to ask her about how she thinks autonomous cars will begin to change urban life. Tell me about Singapore’s approach to self-driving cars. The idea of autonomous vehicles is one measure we’re looking at to see a reduction in private car ownership. According to research done with M.I.T., we would only need about a third of the current vehicle population to provide mobility on demand. We find that a lot of private cars spend most of their time in parking lots. The land we use for parking could be used for other purposes. We are a very dense city, and we have been trying to plan our households around concentration of people. By 2030, we anticipate that eight out of 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk of a rapid-transit station. What about people who don’t live in a dense urban environment? Eighty percent of our population lives in high-rise housing. So we can safely say the majority live in dense conditions. How else do you see autonomous cars being used? Another possible use for them is trash collection and road sweeping. They don’t have to operate during people’s working hours. They can work in the dead of night, which helps us with congestion problems. What are the other motivating factors? We also have to reduce our reliance on manpower. It’s been increasingly difficult to recruit truck drivers and bus drivers in Singapore from our local population. We’re also trying to reduce our reliance on foreign labor. How will the technology transform the city? We are not so excited about the technology itself, as far as people owning self-driving cars. We are more focused on using autonomous vehicles as an urban infrastructure — a shared system that could allow the kind of accessibility that people have come to expect from their own cars. They could be as convenient as private cars, but at a much more affordable price point, and without adding to congestion and pollution. How might the shift reshape the work-life balance? Our whole relationship to commuting will change. It’s very appealing to our millennial generation, who are constantly on their phones and screens, and it will free people from focusing on driving. They can email and go on social media or read a book. You’ve talked a lot about the upsides. Are there any potential downsides that you’re preparing for? There are people who rely on being drivers as their jobs, but this is part of a greater technological disruption. There will be ways of either retraining or reskilling people whose jobs depend on driving to keep them gainfully employed. And if we have larger fleets of driverless cars, there will be more jobs to maintain these vehicles and keep them up to speed. Will it be affordable? The price of public transportation is regulated and managed, but we do want to offer people a range of options, including trains and car-sharing, so people can pick the option at the price point that works for them. In some cities in the United States, public transit has made segregation and social inequality worse: For example, certain train stops and bus lines don’t run from lower-income areas to wealthier ones. Is it possible that driverless cars will cause similar discrepancies? We actually think this will make Singapore more equitable as we try to move away from private cars, which worsen the divide between the haves and have-nots.

The Blind Spot of A.I. Cars The ongoing transformation of cars — from mechanical systems of gears and switches into computers with dreams of self-determination — has been accompanied, perhaps predictably, by a parallel evolution in security threats. A decade ago, hacking a car relied on physically tapping into its internal network, for instance through a port sometimes found behind the radio. By 2011, it was possible to do the same thing remotely. In a series of demonstrations using internet-enabled navigation and entertainment systems as ways to hack into a Jeep Cherokee, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek — both of whom later worked on self-driving security issues at companies like Uber, Didi Chuxing and Cruise — turned on its windshield wipers, disengaged the transmission and disabled the brakes, all from 10 miles away. These exploits, though dramatic, took advantage of the same vulnerabilities in cellular networks that might plague any tablet or smart vacuum cleaner. But a future in which one in five vehicles is autonomous will not only increase the attack “surface” (in the metaphor favored by researchers) of the car; it will also force manufacturers to confront more insidious security risks that are only now coming into view. It will become possible to compromise vehicles by hacking the environment. A car that drives itself uses sensors to construct high-resolution images of its surroundings, then runs them through a “classifier” to identify all the objects in the image. The classifier can do this because it has trained on labeled images; after seeing a hundred thousand trucks, it learns to recognize certain features as indicating truck-ness. Today’s most popular and effective classifiers for object recognition, used widely in self-driving car software, are called deep neural networks. But a deep neural network offers researchers very little understanding of why objects become classified as they do. Think of its output as a map, with each classification corresponding, like a ZIP code, to some demarcated region. Instead of existing in just two dimensions, though, the map has more like a thousand dimensions — and the slightest move in any one of these dimensions can push us into a different ZIP code and produce a false classification. This makes it possible for a hacker to construct slightly perturbed images, called “adversarial examples,” that look innocuous to the human eye but fool the car’s brain into making the wrong call, with potentially fatal consequences. Adversarial examples are extremely difficult to defend against. “We don’t understand these attacks,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. “But the deeper question is that we don’t understand deep neural networks.” In a recent paper, Song and her co-authors introduced a method of constructing robust adversarial examples that can even be printed on paper and pasted to road signs. A stop sign defaced with specially calibrated graffiti, for instance, is recognized as a 45 m.p.h. speed-limit sign. Song’s warning extends beyond road infrastructure. While researchers for decades have been working on — and developing countermeasures for — software vulnerabilities, the study of security issues related to deep learning is still in its infancy. “We don’t have a precise mathematical definition of a pedestrian,” Song says. “There’s no way for us to write down a formula describing exactly what a pedestrian is. So we can’t even really define our security goals.” Even with a recent surge of interest in adversarial examples, researchers are still struggling to understand the scope of the problem. Given the physical-world ramifications, Song says, “we should have started even sooner.” Yiren Lu is a writer and software engineer in New York.

The Liability Conundrum If you think the aftermath of car crashes is complicated now — the arguments over fault, over repair costs, over whose insurance policy will pay — wait until self-driving cars are sharing the roads with human drivers. Start with all those delicate and expensive parts that communicate with a car’s software in order to make its autonomy possible. A fender-bender involving a Tesla means an expensive fender needs to be paid for; a part full of sensors and cameras costs a lot more to replace than a hunk of plastic on the back of an old Camry. In fact, some car insurers, like one AAA affiliate, have already said they would charge more to insure certain Tesla models. Tesla has countered with a campaign to convince insurers that its cars will be in fewer crashes; the company points to findings by regulators that its vehicles are involved in 40 percent fewer accidents when its autopilot software is installed. The trickiest part of the transition to a self-driving future may be figuring out liability when accidents do happen. Instead of quarreling only about which driver was at fault, we will also be able to argue about whether the self-driving features in either car may have played a role. A preview of these complications was evident in the aftermath of the crash that killed Joshua Brown, the Ohio man whose autopiloted Tesla ran into a tractor-trailer. Federal investigators determined that the accident was not caused by a defect in the autopilot software, and Tesla has said repeatedly that drivers should always have their hands on the wheel even when they are using the technology. But officials noted that Tesla’s technology was unable to detect cross-traffic like that presented by the tractor-trailer. Tesla subsequently updated its software to make similar accidents less likely in the future. So who was responsible for covering the damages? The insurance policy that covered Brown, who may not have fully understood the capabilities of his car, or Tesla? Neither Tesla nor Brown’s family has commented on who paid. And both car insurers and insurance regulators have been relatively slow to contend with the difficulty in assigning liability when a person is driving a car only part of the time. “Insurance policies have not necessarily caught up with the global advancement of A.I. technology in cars,” Brown’s lawyer told me. Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley, which is racing to raise the curtain on the era of autonomous vehicles, is also thinking about insurance. A start-up called Driav intends to bring down insurance rates by monitoring the reams of data coming out of self-driving cars in order to figure out, on a second-to-second basis, who or what caused the errors that led to a crash. “It’s silly that claims are a ‘he said, she said’ argument,” Dan Peate, Driav’s chief executive, told me. “The data can just tell us what happened.” The company hopes to begin offering insurance policies next year, with the expectation that they will be cheaper in part because the cars will be in fewer accidents and in part because it plans to be able to shift some liability onto the carmakers. In the long run, when all vehicles are driving themselves, the manufacturers themselves are very likely to assume all of the blame for accidents. Most such companies have said that they plan to pay for anything that happens while their cars and software are in charge. When that’s the case, insurance begins to look a lot more like a product warranty, covered by the carmaker, than a stand-alone product that a customer has to worry about. But in the transition years until then, there are likely to be a lot more messy arguments. Nathaniel Popper is a technology reporter for The Times.

Get Ready for D.O.A.s When I think about the future these days, I inevitably return to a tweet from the writer Elizabeth Hamilton-Argyropoulos (a.k.a. @bourgeoisalien): “The saddest part about self-driving cars will be all the times people die mid-trip and then ur dinner guests or pizza guy will arrive dead.” To read this joke is to become immediately certain that this will absolutely happen — of course it will! — and that it will furthermore become as much a part of the texture of everyday future life as, say, traffic delays caused by collisions are now. Admittedly, the dead-pizza-guy notion doesn’t seem very likely: A large part of the impetus behind the development of self-driving technology in the first place is the desire to do away with the need for flesh-and-blood people who demand wages for their work. But the image feels symbolically resonant precisely because of the ghostly future of all those moribund jobs. Self-driving cars bearing the earthly remains of the recently deceased — automated Ubers, say, with heart-attack victims sprawled incredulously across the rear seat — are, in this sense, an extreme metaphor for the near future of capitalism. The technology will be miraculous, yes; but if it functions as intended, it will serve as an uncanny vector of human obsolescence. Mark O’Connell is a writer based in Dublin.

What Uber Was Built For If the history of highly anticipated technologies is any guide, the big hairy questions about self-driving cars will quickly give way to more practical ones: Where to go? What to do with this extra time? Can I ... take a nap? Self-driving cars will arrive for us as prompts for us to reconsider our lifestyles, and the way transit shapes and fits into them; for automakers, the transition will be a huge and perilous opportunity, representing either a new beginning or the beginning of an end. But there is one party for whom the meaning of the self-driving future is unambiguous: the ride-sharers. “Ride-sharing” was always a misnomer for companies like Uber and Lyft. As with the rest of the “sharing economy,” nothing was ever being shared; labor and services were being bought and sold. But as ride-share companies have grown, their ambitions have multiplied and compounded. Currently, their horizons are limited by widespread car ownership, alternative transit options and, primarily, their own cost. But autonomous cars make their grander plans — dreams of vast fleets of perfectly allocated and used vehicles — more plausible. They zero out a single variable, the cost of labor, that these companies believe is holding them back from utterly reshaping the world. Ride-share businesses are uniquely poised to manifest and demonstrate the big ideas of self-driving cars. They aren’t waiting for this change; they’re doing everything in their power to hasten it. Autonomous cars aren’t just part of the plan; they are the plan. Conservative estimates put the world’s Ubers and Lyfts in an enviable position as self-driving cars roll out. Bullish projections put them in an unassailable one. A 2017 report by Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, told the story in four numbers. A rider’s “all-in cost per mile” for average United States taxi services was about $3.50. For a human-driven Uber in San Francisco, that number was about $2.86. Assuming the same fuel price, the figure for personal cars is much lower, at around 70 cents. The estimate for self-driving taxi services, circa 2020, would cut that cost in half. At 35 cents per mile, tasks that were previously too expensive or that would have felt ridiculous become reasonable and routine. A world in which moving yourself or moving things to you costs almost nothing in terms of money or attention would remake places and transform lives. It would also bring with it new and complicated absurdities — the sort Americans adapt to quickly and then forget. (Like bottles of water shipped around the world and sold for $2, or electronics products assembled in one country from parts from six others, to be shipped to a seventh.) Riders will thrill to this new infrastructure as it incorporates the roads around them, providing novel experiences and conveniences. But this excitement will prevent us from seeing that our aspiring fleet managers hope to create something like the profound consolidation of the internet’s recent past. Just as Amazon the online store laid the groundwork for Amazon the comprehensive and omnipresent service, apps for human-driven taxis may have laid the groundwork for a thrumming on-demand grid, on which people and things can be placed and retrieved. Like Google and Facebook before them, which remapped, rerouted and dominated the old and diverse web infrastructure on which they were built, Uber and Lyft could say, credibly, that they work better with size and full participation. That market domination is merely the flip side of completeness. They will aspire to monopoly and could achieve, with startling speed, real and unprecedented claims over the roads we share — they will say they’ve found a better use for them, and if all goes to plan, riders will agree.

John Zimmer on A Whole New Lyft Unless you’re a millionaire or a truck driver, your first encounter with a self-driving vehicle will probably be a car you ordered through a ride-hailing app like Lyft or Uber. These companies, which spent the first stage of their lives trying to get drivers into their cars, are spending the next one trying to get them out. There will be some initial awkwardness around self-driving vehicles, just as there was around ride-hailing in the first place. (Remember when it was weird to get into a stranger’s unmarked car?) But Lyft, for one, is betting that it can put a trustable face on the tech. In July, it announced Level 5, a lab where it will work on its own driverless software, in addition to developing an open self-driving network that companies like Ford and Jaguar Land Rover will be able to plug their vehicles into. The idea of the network is to combine multiple kinds of autonomous vehicles under one routing-and-request system, so that when you order a Lyft, the app will assess your route, check the weather and other factors and send you the best ride, whether that’s an autonomous Waymo or a human-driven S.U.V. John Zimmer, Lyft’s co-founder and president, explained its thinking. Uber built its own self-driving technology. Why did you decide to do it the way that you did? We weren’t in a position to start this effort two or three years ago. But by being later to launch, we’re able to take a different approach. Many platforms and technology have changed a lot in the last couple years. There are things that we can skip over. Lyft made people comfortable with riding in strangers’ vehicles by having pink mustaches on the front of the cars and friendly drivers. How do you plan to make people comfortable with a car that has no driver? I think that the first wave of autonomous vehicles will look very similar to the ones currently on the road, but as we move to the second wave, they’ll be more like a room on wheels. In a situation where you have 10 or 12 people in a car, we will have more of a shared-vehicle experience. In those cases, having a driver-host will make a ton of sense. Having hospitality delivered by other people is another way to make users comfortable — that’s why we don’t think there will ever be a moment where there would be fewer drivers or fewer job opportunities. You don’t think that there might be fewer Lyft drivers even 20 years from now? I think you’ll have way more. The cost of owning a car is $9,000 a year. Let’s say we offer a $500 monthly plan in which you can tap a button and get access to transportation whenever you want it, and you get to choose your room-on-wheels experience. Maybe you want a cup of coffee on your way to work, or you want to watch the Warriors game later, so you’re in what’s basically a sports bar, with a bartender. If 0.5 percent of all miles driven are done on a ride-sharing app, and then if that number increases to, say, 80 percent, it’ll be such a huge industry shift that even if only 2 percent of that 80 percent is done by human drivers, it still represents a drastic increase in the number of human ride-sharing drivers. Will there be a price difference between human-driven cars and autonomous cars? Maybe in the early days, people will pay more for the service, and again in the long term, when it’s a full-on experience. There are a lot of variables. When cars first replaced the horse and buggy, there was a backlash from people who thought they would take over. Do you think something similar will happen in the next few years as people start to see autonomous cars on the road? If companies don’t do a good job of explaining what’s happening and how it will impact society, that’s possible. I’m confident in how Lyft is going to behave. Right now, you guys want to be everyone’s friends in this industry. Will there be a time when the business becomes more mercenary? We’ll see. We’ve never seen a shift like this in our lifetime. To think that only one or two companies will handle the transition is incorrect.

But life in Villa Altagracia, D.R., had been difficult. Little work was available. Ms. De La Cruz took cleaning jobs whenever she could, and Mr. Castro had a small food company.

In 2009, Mr. Castro moved to Manhattan seeking a better life for his family. In 2014, during one of his infrequent visits home, the couple married in a civil ceremony. Days later, he brought Ashanty to New York. His wife and stepdaughter stayed behind as they waited for their visas to be processed.

Ashanty spoke to her mother daily by phone after her move, but that was no substitute for being together.

Even though they have reunited, it has sometimes been a struggle to bridge the gap and re-establish roles. On a recent evening, seated on a couch at Ashanty’s bilingual middle school for an interview, Ms. De La Cruz and her older daughter waited for Ashanty, who was running late. Unable to find them, Ashanty wandered the halls of the school, Salomé Ureña de Henriquez Intermediate School, which is affiliated with Children’s Aid, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

Finally, she called her stepsister and joined them briefly, and then almost forgot to ask permission before leaving to go to the library to finish homework.

“It’s still difficult,” her mother said. “I say, ‘Listen to me,’ and she doesn’t.”

Hoping to reconnect with Ashanty, Ms. De La Cruz, 45, signed up for parenting classes provided through the school’s partnership with Children’s Aid. She has taken more classes there than almost any other parent, said Lidia Aguasanta, a program coordinator. Ms. De La Cruz has completed coursework on subjects like social and emotional intelligence and nutrition.

In May, Ms. Aguasanta hosted a parent-student assembly at which students read aloud memories of their parents. Reading from her paper in English, Ashanty said, “I was so happy when my dad told me that my mother was coming to this country.” She said she could always depend on her mother to come to school if she had a problem, concluding, “She does everything so that I could have a good future.”

Even before her words were translated, they brought her mother to tears.

They have had to learn how to be a family again while also adjusting to living in a new country. They were especially unprepared for New York winters. Mr. Castro earns about $1,400 a month constructing windows, and Ms. De La Cruz has not secured work since arriving in the United States. In December, Children’s Aid used $250 from the Neediest Cases Fund for Old Navy gift cards to buy the family sweaters, coats and boots. They also received $125 in Key Foods gift cards for groceries.

Ms. De La Cruz faced a deadline this past August for the $330 immigration fees for her and her older daughter. She wondered how she and her husband would scrape together the money. But the younger Ms. De La Cruz, now 20, eased her worries: Since moving to the Bronx, she had saved enough in tips from her waitressing job in Newark to pay the fees ahead of schedule.

“It was such a beautiful moment,” her mother said of learning the news.

Her older daughter shrugged, calling it her obligation and saying, “I wanted it to be a surprise.”

They both understand what it means to be separated from a child. When they immigrated to New York, the younger Ms. De La Cruz left behind her 3-year-old daughter, Darah. Mr. Castro’s permanent residency covered the sisters, but not his stepgrandchild. Ms. De La Cruz sends money to the Dominican Republic for Darah, and they connect daily through the WhatsApp messaging app.

When asked how she imagined her future, the younger Ms. De La Cruz said she wanted to study industrial engineering.

“I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay.
In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.
The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat.

The two shared an appreciation of a spare style that would influence countless others in photography and literature. In fact, Evans entrusted Hemingway with a trove of original prints to ensure they would not be confiscated by the authorities who were violently suppressing popular outrage against the dictator Gerardo Machado.

Now, 46 of those vintage prints are being sold by DeWolfe and Wood Rare Books of Alfred, Me., and Michael Brown Rare Books of Philadelphia, and are featured in a catalog whose comprehensive introductory essay was written by Mr. Brown. The collection is owned by Benjamin Bruce, known as Dink. His father, Telly Otto Bruce, known as Toby, was Hemingway’s friend and factotum and had safeguarded the images for decades in Key West, Fla., where Hemingway had lived.

Evans had gone to Cuba to make pictures for “The Crime of Cuba,” a book by Carleton Beals that was a fierce critique of American adventurism. “The Beals book is an expose of our misgovernment in Cuba, and the disgraceful part we have played in her tragic history past and present, economic, social, political,” read the review in Kirkus. “Sins of omission perhaps even more than sins of commission. The story of Cuba is the story of tyranny-Spain, the United States, Wall Street, and now, closely linked with the immediate past, the dictatorship of Machado, which makes Mussolini look like a Sunday School picnic.”

Evans got a taste of that supercharged political climate in his earliest days there, according to Mr. Brown’s essay, where a bus ride could turn into a journey of intrigue as who-knows-who was tailing him as he tried to meet with opposition figures. At the same time, the city thrilled him.

“When you are still bewildered,” Evans wrote in his diary, “you notice more things, as in a drunk. I was drunk with a new city for days.”

That feeling became literal when he met Hemingway, likely through an introduction by one of Beals’s newspaper contacts on the island. “I had a wonderful time with Hemingway,” Evans was quoted in the catalog’s essay. “Drinking every night. He was at loose ends … and he needed a drinking companion, and I filled that role for two weeks.”

Photo

But as the essay also noted, Hemingway’s prose style may have had an influence on Evans, whose vision had been influenced earlier by a stay in Paris, where he came to appreciate the work of Eugène Atget. The images — out of a total of 400 taken during his one-month sojourn, betray that influence in photos of facades and streets. Some of them show more isolated, intimate scenes in public, from a haggard looking country family to beggars. In several images, Evans copied grisly newspaper images of people killed by Machado’s forces.

The politically-charged atmosphere led Evans to give Hemingway the prints that would, in turn, be taken to Key West by boat. Once there, the images ended up in storage either behind, or next to, Sloppy Joe’s, the famous Key West saloon.

“The humidity of Key West made a lot of things a little ripe, but the photos are beautiful,” Scott DeWolfe said. “What is fascinating is I think Evans was printing these where he was able to. Unlike later prints, most of these are uncropped, and slightly different. One print has Evans’s thumbprint. It’s as close to a first generation print you could possibly find.”

“That was everything that’s good about Green School in one moment: The hands-on learning, the respect for school values, the connection to the community.” As a tear brimmed, she changed tack.","Its popularity offers the provocative suggestion that the next generation of leaders requires not necessarily math or literature or history — though Green School teaches those too — but a wider set of tools, ranging from adaptability to teamwork to the sort of problem-solving that flourishes under conditions of constraint, which will prove useful in a world whose resources will only continue to diminish. It is a prep school meant to do more than merely prepare students for college, but also equip them with survival skills for an unknown new world, in which proficiency with alternative fuels and sustainable building practices — and the experience of living in a nontraditional, unpredictable environment — might be more useful benchmarks than SAT scores.

FOR ALL ITS idealistic trappings, Green School was founded, initially, on a pragmatic concern. “I wanted to stay in Bali,” John Hardy told me, “and I didn’t have anywhere to send the kids.” John, who grew up in Canada, moved to Ubud in 1975. He met Cynthia in Bali in the ’80s, and their two daughters attended Green School. (Hardy’s other two children, from a previous marriage, were too old to attend by the time the school was founded, though his eldest, Elora, has a Bali-based company that specializes in building with bamboo and helped design several structures at the school.) The local Balinese schools were all about learning “by rote,” he said; at the other end, the traditional expat-driven international schools were a “monoculture” of privilege. The Hardys enlisted local friends and acquaintances, along with some international recruits, and in 2008, Green School was born.

It is not hard to see in John and Cynthia Hardy something of the spirit of Rudolf Steiner — the polymathic, charismatic Austrian whose principles informed the school he created in 1919 for the children of the workers in a German cigarette factory called Waldorf-Astoria. (The name lives on in more than 1,000 Waldorf schools worldwide.) While the Hardys abandoned an early idea to actually start a Steiner school — too much dogma, John told me — the influence remains. Not simply in the Green School’s emphasis on “holistic” (i.e., not strictly academic) development and “experiential” learning, but in highlighting the aesthetics of the classroom. (Steiner once called the schoolroom a “veritably barbaric environment.”)

Photo

Kate Druhan, a pragmatic, droll Australian and former human resources manager who serves as the school’s board of management chair, told me the school has cherry-picked its curriculum — a dose of Australia here, some International Baccalaureate there, with a dash of Singapore Math for good measure — and stressed what she called “integrated thematics” across subjects; when learning about ancient Egypt, for example, students will explore its history, but they might also use the pyramids to study geometry. But what most distinguishes Green School from other expat-driven international schools found the world over is its strong connection to the local community, and its emphasis on doing. “At most schools,” Medema said, “you learn about making a bridge in a book. At progressive schools, you maybe make it out of matchsticks or carve it out of soap. At Green School, you actually just go and make it.”

That the school’s model is still in flux may be in the very nature of progressive education, which, going back to Steiner and other pioneers, has defined itself against not only reigning pedagogy, but, to a certain extent, against current society. (For example, Steiner wanted his schools to be free from rigid class boundaries.) But it is not always clear what that means; as Druhan told me, she prefers the word “progressive” to “alternative,” because “you can go in all kinds of directions.” With technology, for example, Medema said, “a lot of parents will come here thinking, I don’t want my kid near any wires — I thought Green School was zero tech.” Another group, she continued, wants facilities that are top-notch, “but in the jungle.”

Photo

Ambitiously idealistic experiments often collapse under the weight of their own internal contradictions, and it is certainly possible to find these at Green School: Here are mostly Western, affluent families, many of them temporarily abandoning their comfortable lives for a metaphysical gap year of voluntary simplicity (or life rebalancing or spiritual reawakening) in an exotic stage-setting, at a school whose annual tuition (roughly $15,000 a year for a sixth-grader), while a bargain compared to New York City private-school standards, is far beyond the reach of the average Balinese. (Hardy’s original vision of having at least 20 percent of the school comprised of Balinese scholarship students was, Druhan noted, easier to scale when the school had 90 students. Today, about 9 percent of the student body are on scholarships.) Still, as much as any parent who’s unsure whether his child is getting the best education (in other words, all parents), I surveyed with envy the kids merrily clambering down jungle paths, the river gurgling in the background and the colorful shrines bedecking the hillsides, thinking grimly of my daughter encased in her sealed-window institutional public school building, shunted to the school gym to watch movies on days with a little bit of bad weather.

Faced with a problem involving the school’s hydropower system, the students were working with master’s students at the University of Cologne in Germany to design and build a new system that will combine solar and hydro power. On sunny days, surplus solar power will pump river water up to a holding tank. On cloudy days, that water will be released downhill, powering a turbine. Green School’s students scuba dive with CoralWatch and spend summers as oil-rig hounding “kayaktivists” and attend U.N. climate conferences; they start fashion companies like Nalu (which dedicates a portion of sales to help children buy school uniforms in India and Indonesia) and lobby the Balinese government to reduce the scourge of plastic bags on the island. “They really do want kids to go off and change the world, as clichéd as that sounds,” Blair told me.

BUT EVEN AMID this backdrop of plucky inventiveness and rational reuse, this armature of sustainable skills, was there not only an impulse toward betterment but a small whiff of dystopia — a prep school prepping for a world that is increasingly out of whack? Is the old paradigm really over?

According to Green School parents I spoke to, it is. A variety of “digital nomads,” early retirees, midcareer rebooters and Steiner evangelists, they spoke of being on a shared mission. Regan Williams, who first enrolled as a boarding student (a rarity here; as Medema told me, “You can go to jail for life in Bali for doing teenage stuff”), inspired the rest of her family to come over from Santa Barbara, Calif. Her father, Rob Williams, wrote me over email, “the families are bonded by the fact you have to be a little nuts to move to the middle of the jungle in Bali. … Everyone is sweaty and has bug bites. … Our kids are challenged, engaged and happy.” Alan Fleischmann, a doctor retired from the Mayo Clinic, told me over beers one night that he and his wife Kara chose Green School for their 6-year-old daughter after an exhaustive global search: “We’re trying to work out how you educate for a life in 20 years’ time — what are the skills she might need, and where do you get them?” This being Bali, other factors entered the decision-making process as well. He and his “witchy” wife, as he lovingly termed her, tuned in to Bali, and received a portent of sorts. “You can argue it’s coincidence, but we had a dramatic indication that Mother Bali wanted us here.” As for his daughter’s education, Fleischmann considers skills like memorization largely useless. “I’ve never studied tropical medicine,” he said, though he is often pressed to consult in Bali. “Fifteen minutes on my phone and I know as much as anyone.” At Green School, he said, he saw examples of “project-based management” — “how do you get through something using critical thinking. All that emphasis is not found in a lot of other places.”

Photo

Many families, Medema told me, come on the vacation and end up staying for the education. Michael Diamond, a.k.a. Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, who enrolled his two sons (Davis, 15, and Skyler, 13) this year (he and his ex-wife take turns living in Bali), first visited the school at the insistence of Skyler, whose friend had recently enrolled. Diamond was struck by how different it felt from the “traditional boarding school model — you go here because your grandfather went here and then you’re going to go to Yale and then work at this law firm and charge people $500 an hour to argue about nothing.” The sense I had from many Green School parents, echoing the school’s idea of nurturing and developing the whole student, was not only the hope that the school would help make their children better citizens, but would leave them better placed to navigate a world in which values and norms were changing. That the old prep school model might be lacking is not necessarily a progressive thought; the head of Manhattan’s elite Trinity School recently warned in a letter to parents that his institution was in danger of becoming a “credentialing factory,” helping to produce a “cognitive elite that is self-serving, callous and spiritually barren.”

When I asked Druhan if she could sum up Green School in one moment, she paused. One of her strongest memories was when her young son was doing the “rice thematic”— rice being of central economic and cultural import in Bali. His class had gone out in the fields to learn how to grow rice. He raved about the farmer. “He said, ‘Mum, he’s like a scientist! He has so much knowledge, and he doesn’t have even any instruments.”’ The students went on not only to harvest the rice, but cook an elaborate dinner in an underground fire pit, which they served to the farmers, parents and teachers. “That was everything that’s good about Green School in one moment: The hands-on learning, the respect for school values, the connection to the community.” As a tear brimmed, she changed tack. “Then there are other moments,” she said, with a wry smile. “I sat down with my coffee the other day and there were six parents talking about what the best coffee enema was — exactly how it works and the condition of how it came out. I thought, ‘Well, that’s only at Green School.’ ”",The School Prepping for Apocalypse,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/t-magazine/bali-green-school.html

Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections.","For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always.

Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure.

In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best.

As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao — sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment — joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that?

Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help.

What’s the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out.

The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers.

Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rosé or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered.

In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It’s not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else.

That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate.

Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencías from Spain, rieslings — all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do.

For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold.

Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of.

The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardèche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called “a feeling of over the river and through the woods.”

Tejal’s second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment.

The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast.

Pete brought a rosé sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedès region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidónio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal.

Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled.

This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh.

Florence’s white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip.

Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect “sinister,” but even so, it was easily tolerable.

My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d’Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily sémillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically.

My red was a 2015 Cahors from Château Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Collectively, most of these wines added good options to the tried-and-true selections. Tejal, however, second-guessed her choice of the Spanish chasselas. “I realized that maybe something I personally liked is not for everybody,” she said.

She’s correct only to the extent of the distance that a wine lies from the mainstream. Otherwise, I live by the last rule.

Rule No. 4: Choose wines that you like; everybody else will like them, too.

Recipe Pairing: Cornbread Madeleines With Jalapeño

A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeño-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT

Consistent with Virginia, many of the Clinton-Romney voters are sticking with Democrats, with half saying they will vote for the party’s candidate.

Perhaps most significantly, half of the Obama-Other voters are committed to voting for the Democrat in 2018; half are undecided (presumably between voting and not voting at all). Based on my analysis of Voter Study Group data, these voters tend to be much more nonwhite, poorer and less educated than the overall electorate. They’re the marginal voters Democrats need to mobilize to win.

The next graphic measures voters’ attitudes toward economic and cultural issues.

The Fault Line: Culture Wars The three groups of vote switchers are largely left-of-center on economic policy (Obama-Clinton voters are included for comparison). But the Obama-then-Trump segment is much more conservative on social issues — suggesting they won’t be easily won over to the Democratic side. Bars indicate the range of political views held by about 95 percent of the people in each voter group. Centrist How they voted in: Liberal Conservative ’12 ’16 Economic issues Obama Clinton 3rd party/ didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Cultural issues Obama Clinton 3rd party/ didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Bars indicate the range of political views held by about 95 percent of the people in each voter group. Centrist More liberal More conservative How they voted in: 2012 2016 Economic issues Obama Clinton Third party or didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton Cultural issues Obama Clinton Third party or didn’t vote Obama Obama Trump Romney Clinton

The Obama-Trump voters who plan to stick with Republicans are more consistently conservative on both economic and cultural dimensions, but particularly on the latter (they are still broadly left of center on the economic dimension).

The Republican-voting Romney-Clinton voters don’t differ too much from Democrat-voting Romney-Clinton voters — this group might include those who have always voted Republican; maybe some old liberal Nelson Rockefeller-style Republicans; or maybe some voters who don’t follow politics very closely and don’t realize that the Republican Party is more conservative than them. In the Obama-Other category, the undecideds look a lot like the Democratic voting decideds, squarely in the liberal camp.

Since most of the voters are in all three subgroups (and the national electorate, too) lean left economically, a strong progressive economic message would almost certainly help Democrats. Moving right on economics, by contrast, will not help Democrats with any of these voters and could even risk losing some, demoralizing an energized base, especially younger voters.

On culture, there’s also not a whole lot to be gained by triangulating, particularly if Democrats want to mobilize the Obama-Other category of voters. Besides, if the racially tinged campaign of Mr. Northam’s opponent, Ed Gillespie, is indeed a preview of how Republicans plan to run in 2018, Democrats are going to have a hard time neutralizing cultural issues, and they’re going to struggle to win over rural voters who are motivated by these issues.

Their best bet will be to offer a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters.

The Virginia results suggest Democrats still might also be able to expand their base without attempting to reach these voters with a new economic populism — results that will certainly give comfort to the donor class of the party that gets nervous every time Bernie Sanders begins talking. The inevitable pendulum swing against the Republican Party, Mr. Trump’s deep unpopularity, an energized electorate and the wave of Republican congressional retirements — and the slow but steady demographic shift toward a younger, more diverse electorate — will all give Democrats an advantage that they can ride mostly just by being Democrats and not doing stupid things.

Project this trend forward, and perhaps a just-out-of-reach suburban Atlanta House district that a Democratic nominee, Jon Ossoff, narrowly lost this year becomes a narrow Democratic pickup in 2018.

Still, the better bet for Democrats would be to present a sharper economic message, which offers at least some possibility of gain among Obama-Trump voters and Obama-Other voters, with little risk of alienating Romney-Clinton voters.

It’s also better for our politics. The more Democrats rely simply on upscale voters’ cosmopolitan cultural values and corresponding revulsion to Mr. Trump, the more our political system becomes organized around zero-sum culture issues and locked in increasingly no-compromise polarization.

Tim Herrera: Thank you for chatting with me, Abby! Let’s start easy: What are a few benefits of counting calories?

Abby Langer: Counting calories does give you an overall picture of what you’re eating in a day, so that’s a good thing. It’s also helpful for people to understand relative calorie values. (Like that a burger is higher in calories than an apple.)

Counting calories can also be very motivating. I mean, I wanted that slice of gingerbread at Starbucks yesterday, but it was 400 calories … no way.

TH: Those are all really strong positives. So what are some of the downsides here?

AL: Well first of all, nobody really knows how many calories they really need. I mean, 2000 or 2200 is what everybody says an adult male needs, but what if you’re smaller than average? What if you’re more active?

Also, the calorie counts on packaging can actually be off by up to 20 percent and still be within FDA guidelines! Can you imagine? Your 200 calorie snack is now 240 calories or 180 calories.

And don’t forget that processed food is absorbed differently by the body than whole, uncooked food. So really, what I’m trying to say is this: If you think you know how many calories you need, and how many you’re truly getting, you’re probably incorrect. Isn’t that annoying?

(Not to mention the fact that people who are at risk for or who have a history of an eating disorder can be majorly triggered by counting anything.)

TH: Yeesh, that’s so many downsides. What are some alternative tracking methods you’d recommend if people want to track their eating habits?

AL: Writing down what you ate, when you ate it and how you felt — especially if you’re prone to emotional eating — is a great way to keep track of things without drilling it down into numbers. It can be a hassle, but food records can be really effective.

TH: I love food tracking apps, and I feel like they’re sort of a middle ground between a lot of what you’ve talked about. What are your thoughts on those kinds of apps?

AL: The issue with those is that they still count calories, so even if your intentions are good the calorie-count part can be irresistible for some people. And some apps also track activity and subtract calories burned by exercise from calories eaten, and that couldn’t be more wrong.

TH: Yes! They do do that. It sounds like you’re not a fan …

AL: It’s not how your body works. You can’t exercise off food like that! I believe you can only exercise off up to 30 percent of the calories you eat in one day, but with some apps it appears that you can negate your whole day of eating with a trip to the gym. Nope.

TH: So, O.K., despite the downsides, counting calories is still such an easy to way to track food intake. So if people are going to do it anyway (ahem), what’s the bottom line? What should we take away?

AL: I would try to remember to look for patterns versus taking every calorie literally. And remember: Never feel bad or guilty about overindulging every once in a while, even when it’s a scary thing to look at on your tracker. One crazy day of eating never a diet ruined.

The portraits in “Nothing Personal” present a stark yet authentic counterpoint to the American image of eternal youth and anodyne good cheer. The book’s most resonant chords hover at a frequency detected in the balance of Avedon’s austere minimalism and Baldwin’s mournful jeremiad.

Only one portrait in “Nothing Personal” bears a date: “Maj. Claude Eatherly, Pilot at Hiroshima, August 6, 1945.” It refers not to when the photograph was made but to when Major Eatherly flew weather reconnaissance over Hiroshima and then gave the O.K. to drop the first atomic bomb, code-named “Little Boy.” Avedon first contacted Eatherly to photograph him in early 1963. “For a long, long time I have felt a connection with you, as have my wife and many of my friends,” Avedon wrote to him in Galveston, Tex., “because what happened to you is almost like a metaphor of what many Americans feel has happened to them.” Avedon flew to Galveston to make his tightly cropped portrait of Eatherly, brow furrowed and hand cupped over his eye as if to scrutinize the distant horizon.

In a series of museum talks, Colin Westerbeck, the eminent photography historian, argued that Major Eatherly is the central portrait in “Nothing Personal,” perhaps even in Avedon’s entire career. He pointed out the absence of shadow and the blown-out background in Avedon’s portraiture that left “every wrinkle, stubble, wen and nervous tick” on his subjects faces strikingly visible. “When that bank of strobes went off in Avedon’s studio — pfoom! — subjects must have felt as if they’d been caught in an atomic bomb blast,” Mr. Westerbeck said.

That “bomb blast” became the signature style with which Avedon went on to create many series of photographs, including “The Family,” 69 portraits of the most powerful and influential Americans in 1976, published in Rolling Stone for the country’s bicentennial. His 1985 book, “In the American West,” consists of portraits of anonymous workers, drifters, cowboys and random citizens made throughout the Western United States over five years, a contrast to the pantheon of accomplishment and celebrity that characterized most of Avedon’s portraiture.

In conceiving “Nothing Personal,” Avedon might have had in mind a dialogue with “The Americans,” by Robert Frank, published five years earlier — an artist’s book that struck a sober note about the story America told itself versus the realities of daily life for its citizens. At the time, “The Americans” was little known outside of New York art circles, but the book had a profound influence on photographers — including Avedon — and on the direction of photography itself. While Mr. Frank had traveled across the country to capture happened-upon moments in ordinary life, Avedon’s idiom was the portrait, with which he was equally intent on telling a deeper truth about America. Implicit in Avedon’s version was the persistent threat to our existence, something the Cuban missile crisis had brought that much closer two years before “Nothing Personal” was published. At the time, Avedon considered the portraits in the book to be “some of my very best work.”

Yet, to his surprise and chagrin, the public reaction was swift and hostile. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Robert Brustein lashed out at the book’s extravagant “snow-white covers with sterling silver titles” before excoriating the effort in his critique. (It predated by six years Tom Wolfe’s incendiary 1970 essay, “Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny’s,” in New York magazine — a savage takedown of New York’s intellectual circle of “limousine liberals” as conspicuous hypocrites.) “‘Nothing Personal’ pretends to be a ruthless indictment of contemporary America,” Brustein wrote, “but the people likely to buy this extravagant volume are the subscribers to fashion magazines, while the moralistic authors of the work are themselves pretty fashionable, affluent, and chic.”

Truman Capote came to Avedon’s defense in a letter to the editors published the following month: “Would he rather it was printed on paper-toweling?” Capote asked. “Brustein accuses Avedon of distorting reality. But can one say what is reality in art? — ‘An artist,’ to repeat Picasso, ‘paints not what he sees, but what he thinks about what he sees.’ This applies to photography — provided the photographer is an artist, and Avedon is.”

The year before “Nothing Personal” was published, Avedon had traveled to the South to photograph leaders of the civil rights movement, among them Martin Luther King Jr., as well as those who staunchly opposed it, such as Gov. George Wallace, of Alabama. When he returned to New York, he opened his studio to photographers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (S.N.C.C.) to train them to shoot rallies and sit-ins in a photojournalistic style that the mainstream press would publish. He convinced Marty Forscher, the owner of Professional Camera Repair Service, to donate 75 cameras and a supply of film to the S.N.C.C. for three years. In 1965, Visual Arts Gallery, where Avedon was a board member, mounted a show of S.N.C.C. photographers’ work.

At DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Avedon, who was Jewish, and Baldwin, who was African-American, were editors of “The Magpie,” the school’s literary magazine. They conceived a project with text and photographs called “Harlem Doorways” that never fully got off the ground. In later years, Avedon recounted the time as students when Baldwin came to visit him at home on East 86th Street, and the doorman made him use the service elevator. Avedon’s mother was furious and summoned the doorman upstairs to apologize to young Baldwin for the insult.

Can Avedon’s illustrious image coexist with evidence of his social conscience? It is found throughout his work and in the causes he championed, both publicly and privately. In 1955, he photographed Marian Anderson, who was performing in Verdi’s “Un Ballo in Maschera,” the first African-American soloist to sing on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. In the portrait, her mouth is rounded into an oval so expressive that you can almost hear her voice — an unusual feat of visual onomatopoeia. The portrait ran in Harper’s Bazaar and Avedon considered its publication his own small stand against racial discrimination.

In 1959, when Avedon first photographed China Machado, a Chinese-born, Portuguese-American fashion model — encouraged by Diana Vreeland, the fashion editor of Bazaar — the magazine’s publisher said: “Listen, we can’t publish these pictures. The girl is not white.” Avedon was so angry that he threatened to leave Bazaar.

Videos of confrontations between airline workers and passengers have occasionally resulted in financial settlements, as when United pulled David Dao, a Louisville, Ky., physician, off an airplane so they could use his seat for an airline employee. (United says it is not considering equipping its crews with body cameras.) But the case has encouraged other air travelers to threaten staff members with their cellphones.

“People are putting their phone up, saying, ‘You better book me on the next flight.’ They’re trained to intimidate our crew members using their phone,” said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American.

At the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, a union that represents nearly 27,000 workers at American Airlines, the national president, Bob Ross, said airlines needed to protect the privacy and security of flight attendants by enforcing policies limiting what passengers can photograph.

“I’m asking flight attendants to take their full names off their uniforms,” Mr. Ross said, adding that the union would ask the airline to provide name tags with just a first name or a name of the flight attendant’s choosing.

“Passengers are putting their names on social media and private-messaging them and harassing them over the fact that they lost their luggage or a flight was delayed,” he said. “These are real threats that have just gone out of proportion over the past year, and how do you stop it?”

Flight attendants at American and elsewhere are threatening to make their own videos to level the field.

“We have had the topic come up after the Dr. Dao event,” said Taylor Garland of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents workers at 19 airlines. “There is much to consider on the issue,” she said in an email statement later. “Any change to conditions in the cabin requires careful consideration.”

While airlines and passengers embrace the opportunities presented in the digital era, the elevation of the camera wars makes it clear that new technology can have unanticipated consequences that will be difficult to address.","On Airplanes, Considering Fighting Cameras With Cameras",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/dealbook/airline-passengers-cameras.html

As president of one of the country’s leading pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Azar was a member of the board of directors at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, the leading industry association for biotech companies.

As the secretary of health and human services, Mr. Azar would be a key player in implementing Mr. Trump’s efforts to crack down on the prices that drug companies charge in the United States, making him responsible for going after the industry that he helped lead for a decade.

A graduate of Yale Law School, Mr. Azar is also likely to be a key part of continuing efforts by Mr. Trump and Republican allies to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, criticized Mr. Trump’s selection of Mr. Azar to lead the agency charged with overseeing drug companies.

“President Trump has railed against the pharmaceutical industry ‘getting away with murder’ on drug prices,” Mr. Welch said. “He promised the American people he would bring skyrocketing drug prices ‘way, way, way, down.’ But when given the chance to put his money where his mouth is, he brazenly nominated a former pharmaceutical executive to lead the agency charged with managing prescription drug costs. Instead of draining the swamp, he has set the fox to guard the henhouse.”

Democratic senators also reacted skeptically to Mr. Azar’s nomination, promising to scrutinize his record for evidence that he would be soft on drug companies.

“I am also interested in how, given Mr. Azar’s professional background, he believes he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat from Washington.

Republican lawmakers vowed quick confirmation hearings and praised Mr. Azar’s experience.

“The leader of H.H.S. will be at the tip of the spear, working to not only right the wrongs of this deeply flawed law but also ensure the long-term sustainability of both Medicare and Medicaid,” said Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, referring to the Affordable Care Act. “Mr. Azar has the experience, knowledge and fortitude to take on these daunting challenges.”",Trump Chooses Alex Azar for Health and Human Services Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/alex-azar-health-human-services-trump.html

Julia Child’s time in France inspired her to capture the country through its cuisine, introducing French cooking to kitchens around the world. But it was that same French magic — and Ms. Child herself — that inspired her husband, Paul, to also capture the country, albeit through a different medium, photography. A new book lets him offer a personal glimpse into the world beyond the kitchen.

“There is this combination of intimacy and formal, rigorous design,” said Alex Prud’homme, the couple’s grandnephew and a co-author of “France Is a Feast: The Photographic Journey of Paul and Julia Child.”

The Childs met while serving in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, leading them to various postings around Europe. But it was Paris, where they arrived in 1948, that captured their hearts.

“Apart from our official lives — cooking and government — the other things we do fall into fairly repetitive categories whose two main divisions are, being entertained and entertaining others,” Mr. Child wrote to his twin brother, Charlie. “Sometimes when we’re being entertained it isn’t people, but just Paris herself who acts as hostess.”

While Ms. Child took French cooking classes, and eventually began work on “Mastering the Art of French Cooking” with Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck, Mr. Child was engaged in diplomatic duties as a cultural attaché for the United States government. And he was rarely without a camera.

The photographs, taken between 1948 and 1954, focus on the beauty of postwar France. The perfectly-landscaped parks, the bustling waterfront in Marseille, the glow of Place de la Concorde at night, a cold fog settling over the Sacré-Coeur basilica. The shadow play on the grand entryways and the underpasses along the Seine.

But Mr. Child’s main subject was always his wife. Ms. Child in the kitchen; changing her clothes on the side of the road; legs propped up in a telephone booth; sunbathing in Cassis.

“This is Julia before she became ‘Julia Child,’” Mr. Prud’homme said.

The detail and expansive catalog of Mr. Child’s work raise the question: Did he have a sense that their lives would have a bigger impact than their immediate Parisian universe?

“He was an obsessive photographer and note taker, it’s almost like he knew back then that their lives were worth preserving for posterity,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “It’s like they were leaving breadcrumbs.”

Mr. Prud’homme helped Ms. Child write her memoir, “My Life in France” (Alfred A. Knopf, 2006), but he felt it wasn’t complete. That’s when Katie Pratt, a longtime family friend of the Childs and the book’s co-author, discovered a “Pandora’s box” of hundreds of black and white and color photographs, everything from surrealistic street documentary to formal portraits and landscapes.

Negatives were clearly labeled. Log books and letters provided a time frame, and were often accompanied by long letters detailing their routine: embassy comings and goings during the Cold War, their meals, the price of wine or the performance they saw the evening before. Everything was for the taking.

Mr. Child had a “distinct style,” Ms. Pratt said.

“His style as a visual artist, whether it was photography or other mediums, it was very important for him to have strong, well-organized, well-balanced compositions, often with perspective and depth,” she said. “There’s often a story going on.”

Mr. Child’s style was heavily influenced by artists living in France at the time. And as a cultural attaché, he quickly gravitated to the top artists of the day: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and Edward Steichen were all friends of his. They even shared the same printer, using Pictorial Service owned by Pierre Gassmann in Paris.

“My interpretation was that Paul was a very independent-minded guy who really developed his own aesthetic, but he was swimming in the waters of these masters of 20th-century photography,” Mr. Prud’homme said.

Mr. Child continued his diplomatic service until 1961, just as Ms. Child’s cooking career in America began to take off. But he always remained behind the camera.

“Paul and Julia, in their own ways, were really good teachers,” Ms. Pratt said. “They really cared about not only perfecting their craft and communicating it clearly with others. They put it to operational proof and shared it with others.”

“That’s something they learned while in the O.S.S.,” Mr. Prud’homme said. “Don’t trust common wisdom, find out for yourself whether something works or doesn’t. That’s something they both did in their art, and cooking.”

For her, this is a dream job. She recalled the first time she went behind the scenes at the museum, as a student, before she actually worked there.

“I’d been let into a building that had 34 million insects. I said, ‘Oh hello, I quite like you.’”

Dr. McAlister’s fascination began in childhood. “I used to catch the fleas off the cats,” she said, inspecting them with a microscope her parents had given her. But she soon gravitated toward more gruesome insects.

Decomposing carcasses of small creatures, also courtesy of the cats, were treasure troves of maggots, which she still delights in. “I quite like the darker side of nature,” she said, just before discussing the lives of spider-killing flies.

The larvae “hurl themselves at spiders” in order to land on them and burrow into the abdomen. They then eat the spider from the inside out. But if the spiders are immature, the larvae may go to sleep for a few years until the spider grows into a bigger meal.

One of her few disappointments: “I’ve yet to get my own botfly.” She means that despite spending time in the tropics, no adult botfly has laid an egg on her arm or leg so that the larva could burrow under her skin and develop into the notoriously painful, itchy worm before it emerges.

Many flies do an enormous service for us and the planet by cleaning up all sorts of the biological world’s detritus, from dead wood to the slime in drainpipes. Drain flies, or sewer gnats, are actually cleaning up human mess. Occasionally, however, they may have a population boom that sends the adults into the air, which is annoying; if the bodies disintegrate into tiny particles in the air, they are potentially harmful to human health.

And, of course, there are the flies that feed on dead bodies — the 1,100 different species of blow flies, favorites of forensic detective shows. The maggots of these flies, like the very attractive bluebottle larva, devour corpses of mice and men and everything else.

Knowledge of which species lay eggs at which stages of decomposition can help determine how long ago a person turned into a body. (If it’s Tuesday, it must be a bluebottle.)

Within science, flies are one of the great subjects of laboratory study. Or rather, the fly: Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, although Dr. McAlister points out it actually belongs to a group called the vinegar flies.

They are easy to work with and share the same basic DNA as all life. Historically, they have provided much of the foundation for modern genetics. And now they may provide deep insights into neuroscience and other fields.

On Thursday, scientists at the Salk Institute reported that their studies of how the fly brain works can improve internet search engines. At the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Institute in Virginia, the search is on to develop a wiring diagram of the fly brain, and then figure out in the greatest detail how they think.

Inviting Flies Into the Newsroom The Times’s James Gorman recently took reader questions on Facebook Live with Erica McAlister, a curator of flies at the National History Museum, London.

And they do think, according to Vivek Jayaraman, who runs a lab there, in the sense that flies don’t just react instinctively. Their brains make decisions based on several different inputs — smell, memory, hunger and fear, for instance. And that whole process is what he hopes to decipher, neuron by neuron. “You can go end to end, potentially, in the fly,” he said.

Dr. McAlister admits the importance of Drosophila, although a bit reluctantly. She is really interested in the countless other fly species, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, from predators that kill dragonflies on the wing to the tiny fungus gnats. There are 160,000 known species of fly, and entomologists can only guess at the number we don’t know — it’s somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions.

Marlene Zuk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota, as well as a decidedly pro-insect scientific popularizer, couldn’t agree more. Dr. Zuk, whose chosen study subject is a cricket, also studies a parasitic fly that lays its larvae in them.

I called her to talk flies. “Wow,” she said, “you never get asked what your favorite fly is.”

Dr. Zuk quickly came up with an unfavorite. “Flies are always cursed by Drosophila,” she said. “But flies are unbelievably diverse.” She mentioned the value to research of the blowfly and referred to a classic paper, and later a book, on hunger in the blowfly, by Vincent G. Dethier.

The paper showed the physiological process that signaled to a blowfly larva that it had eaten enough, for the moment, of whatever dead thing it was dining on. Dr. Dethier also wrote what might be described as a cult favorite, “To Know a Fly.” Assuming entomologists and their hangers-on can be considered a cult.

Flies are actually prolific muses, in addition to their other qualities. Consider “A Fly for the Prosecution,” “The Life of the Fly,” and “Lords of the Fly” for the Drosophila crowd, among many others.

Dr. McAlister said that her work and her book have bemused and pleased her relatives, including an aunt who is quite delighted to have an author in the family. “My parents were a bit confused to start,” she said. “But I was a middle child and they let me do my own thing.” Eventually, she said, they realized, “Oh, she’s done all right.”

Shaun’s inability to read cues can alienate patients. When he’s cogitating on a diagnosis, he goes blank, like a computer app in spinning-wheel mode, and the show suspends the tension long enough that you, like his colleagues, wonder if something’s gone wrong.

The conceit of “The Good Doctor” is that the condition that limits Shaun’s human interactions is inseparable from his gift. I can’t speak to the accuracy of its representation of autism — I am neither a doctor, nor do I play one on TV — but Shaun’s emotional challenge is the show’s emotional engine.

Shaun may not understand human relations well enough to know that, say, he shouldn’t wake his apartment superintendent after midnight. But Mr. Highmore (“Bates Motel”) makes him appealing and eager, with an unintentionally comic candor. (His version of a reassuring diagnosis: “It’s definitely not flesh-eating bacteria!”) You root for him and for his advocate, Dr. Aaron Glassman (Richard Schiff).

“The Good Doctor” was adapted from a South Korean series by David Shore, the creator of “House,” which had a different sort of difficult protagonist. Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) was a crusty, arrogant physician in the sharp-elbowed spirit of the post-9/11 aughts, when figures from Jack Bauer of “24” to Simon Cowell of “American Idol” popularized the idea that nice guys don’t get the job done.

On “House,” the doctor’s misanthropy was as much a strength as a liability — his suspicion (“Everybody lies”) and lack of sentiment led him to ingenious diagnoses.

In the “Good Doctor” pilot, Shaun asks something of a dismissive superior that could have been aimed at his TV predecessor. “You’re very arrogant,” he says. “Do you think that helps you be a good surgeon? Does it hurt you as a person? Is it worth it?”

On the page, that sounds sanctimonious and angry, but Shaun asks it out of curiosity. That’s his way. He’s not cuddly or warm, but he’s guileless and well intentioned — the anti-antihero version of Gregory House. Not just Shaun but his fellow young doctors are learning the art of dealing with frightened patients, getting a feel for the proper dosage of tact, honesty, sympathy and willingness to bend rules.

While there may be different ways to be good and to express caring, “The Good Doctor” suggests, it is something worth aspiring to — an idea that may especially appeal to viewers who have experienced health care as scary, impersonal and alienating.

Elsewhere, “The Good Doctor” creates emotional investment the old-fashioned way: by stabbing a hypodermic needle of it straight into your heart.

The manipulative incidental music is abundant, as are the heart-wrenching scenarios. A bus carrying a wedding party crashes in one episode; in another, we meet a young boy with cancer who is so charming and wise that, if you have watched more than one medical drama in your life, you know he’s not long for this world.

We also get a series of bludgeoningly woeful flashbacks to Shaun’s childhood — his father beats him, his brother dies, his pet rabbit dies — which the show has thankfully dialed back on lately. Even Mr. Schiff, known for playing acerbic characters like Toby Ziegler on “The West Wing,” is cast here as an avuncular guardian teddy bear.

But Mr. Schiff is convincing in the role, and Mr. Highmore is striking in his. “The Good Doctor” has hardly reinvented the syrupy, tear-jerking medical drama. But it has found a new way to complicate that genre’s oldest idea: that human connection is the best medicine.","On ‘The Good Doctor,’ the Anti-Antihero Is In",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/arts/television/the-good-doctor-freddie-highmore-abc.html

Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district.
Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way.
Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes.
At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about.","Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign — the candidate had a demanding day job — was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities. She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reid’s incumbent Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry,” she’d say, with mock solemnity, “Delegate Greason.”

What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues — how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed — were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, “That’s not a congressional thing, that’s a state thing!” or “That’s not a state thing, that’s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!” Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: “Don’t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don’t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn’t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!”

If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it. When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment. “I didn’t want to rain on their ideas,” she said. Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions. She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how he’d come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. She also told them about Reid’s Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry, Delegate Greason” — and all the party-line votes he’d made down in Richmond. “He votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership. From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, he’s for it.”

To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn’t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn’t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large “steering committees” — and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit — but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.

In the months after Trump’s inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left — protests, actions — but few electoral conduits for its new resolve. Virginia provided one of them. In what Sorenson unsentimentally called “16,” Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous year’s election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34. Not a single incumbent lost. Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldn’t help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts. If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority. This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasn’t blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house.

A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid’s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn’t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups’ lists with what she called “hair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.”

Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. “There’s just this huge energy,” Sorenson told me, “with people saying, ‘We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.’ ” They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn’t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.

She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women’s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.

Sorenson’s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification “(co-leader?)” or “(steering committee member?).” She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (“all talk no plans”); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they’d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn’t need the help badly enough.

Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her “Cadillac plan.” The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts — the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community — are gated and thus “unknockable,” which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.

Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason’s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates — bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.

It wasn’t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn’t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson’s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial — volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message — was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.

In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, “No one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.” Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and “this here is ground zero.”

By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign. They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener — a “Weekend of Action” — in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Women’s Summit. This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before. These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate — most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color. Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district. She didn’t want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reid’s) effort early and for good reasons.

The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff’s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.

Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid’s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family’s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.

Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. “Am I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?”

Reid looked to Sorenson before responding. “Nobody will ask you because you look like the district — it’s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it’s really starting to make a difference.” The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid’s biography — a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country — than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.

Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She’d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. “Now the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It’s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren’t caring about Black Lives Matter, well — it kind of opened my eyes. We can’t ever not be engaged again. It’s like the Founding Fathers’ idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they’re on Facebook but they’re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There’s nothing else going on in ’17, and there’s all this pent-up energy.”

Francesca said she had gone to the Women’s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn’t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn’t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgendered former journalist and “freshman member of the Democratic Party” who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. “My opponent,” she said with national-stage charisma, “cares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!” Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. “We’re literally fighting for our democracy,” she said. “It’s ‘Handmaid’s Tale.’ ”

We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people’s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.

In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.

“I don’t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,” she said.

“Well, I was never out canvassing before, either!” Francesca said.

Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a “1” on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a “5.” On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.

By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn’t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign’s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home’s “no soliciting” sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.

This didn’t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups — an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues — and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn’t sure there was much she could do. “They have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.”

The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldn’t afford to dedicate any more time to it just then. She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine. There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trump’s travel ban, and I read it aloud. At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Then she said: “Oh, him. I can’t even worry about him. I can’t even think about him.” She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards. It lasted an hour.

It is never easy to assess a campaign’s progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere. A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorenson’s most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List. Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper. They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June — $53,000 to his $39,000 — with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors. Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank. On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaign’s Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaign’s website. “I was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.” By the end of August they’d visited 32,556 doors. The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions.

The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state’s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate — a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie — hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president’s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of “sanctuary cities,” even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.

It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson’s race, though the summer poll wasn’t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they’d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.

Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He’d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. “There’s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs” for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, “after what we’ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.” He did not seem like the sort of person who’d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.

For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign. They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondent’s vote. The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greason’s record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes — 713, to be precise. A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greason’s absences as a percentage. Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes. Once he left, she looked up. “I know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason! We do not want to express it as a percentage.”

For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign’s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump’s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.

With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign’s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they’d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson’s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken “tens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.” Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. “Well, that last part’s true.”

Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, “We need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.” Sorenson didn’t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, “is just beautiful to me.” And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia “the first statewide referendum on Trump,” that was fine with her, as long as they didn’t set expectations so high that their support couldn’t survive a disappointment.

Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain. Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies. She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters. Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand. She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter who’d had her ballot disqualified for no reason.

The foot traffic — not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa — was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they’d done, over their 11-day “mobilization window,” of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered “I voted” stickers. Then they’d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. “When do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.”

Sorenson didn’t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in — turnout, she thought, couldn’t realistically be as high as it seemed to be — but by 4 o’clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign’s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.

The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun’s precincts were reporting. Reid’s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. “You are so [expletive] awesome,“ one said. “You brought happiness back into our lives,” said another.

Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors — the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory — to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from “Joe Biden’s guy.”

Her finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: “How are you so calm? I feel like we’ve all been in our little bubble, but look” — she gestured toward the television overhead — “we’re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?”

Sorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. “I just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.”",How the ‘Resistance’ Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/magazine/how-the-resistance-helped-democrats-dominate-virginia.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about.","Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign — the candidate had a demanding day job — was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities. She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reid’s incumbent Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry,” she’d say, with mock solemnity, “Delegate Greason.”

What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues — how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed — were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, “That’s not a congressional thing, that’s a state thing!” or “That’s not a state thing, that’s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!” Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: “Don’t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don’t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn’t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!”

If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it. When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment. “I didn’t want to rain on their ideas,” she said. Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions. She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how he’d come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. She also told them about Reid’s Republican opponent, Tag — “Sorry, Delegate Greason” — and all the party-line votes he’d made down in Richmond. “He votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership. From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, he’s for it.”

To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn’t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn’t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large “steering committees” — and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit — but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.

In the months after Trump’s inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left — protests, actions — but few electoral conduits for its new resolve. Virginia provided one of them. In what Sorenson unsentimentally called “16,” Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous year’s election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34. Not a single incumbent lost. Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldn’t help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts. If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority. This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasn’t blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house.

A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid’s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn’t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups’ lists with what she called “hair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.”

Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. “There’s just this huge energy,” Sorenson told me, “with people saying, ‘We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.’ ” They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn’t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.

She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women’s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.

Sorenson’s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification “(co-leader?)” or “(steering committee member?).” She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (“all talk no plans”); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they’d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests — “Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?” “Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?” — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn’t need the help badly enough.

Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her “Cadillac plan.” The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts — the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community — are gated and thus “unknockable,” which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.

Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason’s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates — bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.

It wasn’t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn’t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson’s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial — volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message — was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.

In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, “No one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.” Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and “this here is ground zero.”

By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign. They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener — a “Weekend of Action” — in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Women’s Summit. This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before. These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate — most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color. Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district. She didn’t want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reid’s) effort early and for good reasons.

The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff’s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.

Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid’s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family’s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.

Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. “Am I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?”

Reid looked to Sorenson before responding. “Nobody will ask you because you look like the district — it’s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it’s really starting to make a difference.” The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid’s biography — a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country — than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.

Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She’d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. “Now the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It’s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren’t caring about Black Lives Matter, well — it kind of opened my eyes. We can’t ever not be engaged again. It’s like the Founding Fathers’ idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they’re on Facebook but they’re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There’s nothing else going on in ’17, and there’s all this pent-up energy.”

Francesca said she had gone to the Women’s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn’t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn’t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgendered former journalist and “freshman member of the Democratic Party” who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. “My opponent,” she said with national-stage charisma, “cares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!” Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. “We’re literally fighting for our democracy,” she said. “It’s ‘Handmaid’s Tale.’ ”

We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people’s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.

In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.

“I don’t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,” she said.

“Well, I was never out canvassing before, either!” Francesca said.

Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a “1” on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a “5.” On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.

By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn’t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign’s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home’s “no soliciting” sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.

This didn’t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups — an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues — and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn’t sure there was much she could do. “They have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.”

The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldn’t afford to dedicate any more time to it just then. She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine. There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trump’s travel ban, and I read it aloud. At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Then she said: “Oh, him. I can’t even worry about him. I can’t even think about him.” She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards. It lasted an hour.

It is never easy to assess a campaign’s progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere. A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorenson’s most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List. Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper. They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June — $53,000 to his $39,000 — with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors. Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank. On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaign’s Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaign’s website. “I was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.” By the end of August they’d visited 32,556 doors. The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions.

The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state’s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate — a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie — hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president’s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of “sanctuary cities,” even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.

It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson’s race, though the summer poll wasn’t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they’d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.

Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He’d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. “There’s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs” for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, “after what we’ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.” He did not seem like the sort of person who’d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.

For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign. They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondent’s vote. The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greason’s record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes — 713, to be precise. A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greason’s absences as a percentage. Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes. Once he left, she looked up. “I know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason! We do not want to express it as a percentage.”

For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign’s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump’s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.

With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign’s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they’d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson’s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken “tens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.” Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. “Well, that last part’s true.”

Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, “We need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.” Sorenson didn’t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, “is just beautiful to me.” And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia “the first statewide referendum on Trump,” that was fine with her, as long as they didn’t set expectations so high that their support couldn’t survive a disappointment.

Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain. Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies. She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters. Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand. She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter who’d had her ballot disqualified for no reason.

The foot traffic — not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa — was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they’d done, over their 11-day “mobilization window,” of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered “I voted” stickers. Then they’d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. “When do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.”

Sorenson didn’t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in — turnout, she thought, couldn’t realistically be as high as it seemed to be — but by 4 o’clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign’s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.

The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun’s precincts were reporting. Reid’s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. “You are so [expletive] awesome,“ one said. “You brought happiness back into our lives,” said another.

Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors — the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory — to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from “Joe Biden’s guy.”

Her finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: “How are you so calm? I feel like we’ve all been in our little bubble, but look” — she gestured toward the television overhead — “we’re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?”

Dr. Kathryn Backholer, an expert on the issue at Deakin University in Australia, said taxes on soda were “low-hanging fruit” in the fight against obesity, diabetes and other weight-related diseases because such drinks are easily categorized to tax and sensible to target because they “have little or no nutritional value.”

Dr. Backholer and other experts said the turning point for soda tax proponents came in 2014, when Mexico — Coca-Cola’s biggest consumer market by per capita consumption — approved a 10 percent tax.

Mexico also showcased how dirty the fight could get.

Last year, numerous advocates of a proposal to double Mexico’s tax to 20 percent received strings of upsetting and fraudulent texts from unknown numbers. One man got a message saying his daughter had been seriously injured; another found a text saying his wife was having an affair; a third received a link to a funeral home. Spyware was found on the phones. The proposal failed.

Elsewhere in the world, soda companies have assiduously worked their government connections and economic clout. In internal company emails leaked to an American watchdog group last year, Coke executives described strategies for winning over government ministers and other officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Portugal, and regions of Spain.

The Australian Beverages Council wrote in its 2016 annual report that fighting a soft drinks tax “has been consuming vast amounts of resources,” and that “our learnings from other markets through our international network tells us that these types of threats must be constantly challenged before they get before a parliament for debate.”

In Colombia, where soda is often cheaper than bottled water, the soda-tax fight took place in a key market for beverage makers. Sales volume of carbonated drinks here has climbed more than 25 percent over the past 15 years; during that same time in the United States, it fell 12 percent, according to Euromonitor, a market research firm.

Coke and Pepsi were far less visible in the Colombia battle, leaving the big national beverage company, Postobón, in the spotlight. Postobón, a drinks maker and distributor for Pepsi, is part of a huge conglomerate that includes sugar cane growers, sugar mills and the country’s biggest media company, RCN Televisión, which helped disseminate the anti-tax message. Postobón and RCN declined interview requests.

The stage was set for a clash between a powerful industry and a stubborn public advocate.

Showdown Over an Ad

In early 2016, Colombia, a nation of 49 million, was facing the unfamiliar prospect of stability and peace. After decades of civil war and narco-terrorism, Colombians were enjoying the fruits of an aggressive United States-backed military campaign that had largely decimated the country’s drug cartels. Unemployment was near historic lows, the poverty rate was dropping and millions were hopeful about the possibility of lasting peace with the country’s main rebel group, the FARC.

In March 2016, the country’s health minister, Alejandro Gaviria Uribe, proposed a 20 percent tax on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages — the equivalent of about 10 cents on a liter bottle — that became part of a larger tax overhaul backed by Colombia’s president and the Ministry of Finance.

“For the first time in our lives, we thought we might become a normal country and be able to deal with issues other than violence,” said Diana Guarnizo, a lawyer with Dejusticia, a rights group that helped promote the soda tax. “Here we were, an organization that had dealt with peace, violence, land reform and gross injustice, and suddenly we had the luxury to talk about what mothers are putting in their children’s lunchboxes.”

The measure was designed to inject $340 million a year into Colombia’s chronically underfunded national health care system, but Mr. Gaviria had a larger goal: to dampen soda consumption in a country with an obesity rate that had tripled since 1980 to 19 percent of adults. The fastest growth had occurred among Colombian youth from ages 5 to 17. Each year, 4,000 people age 30 to 70 die from obesity-related illnesses like heart disease and diabetes, the Health Ministry said.",She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry.

But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments.","When the league agreed to the settlement several years ago, retired players were told that they could expect speedy payouts, assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other ailments covered in the settlement were in order.

But the N.F.L. installed so many safeguards and trapdoors into the deal, lawyers for the players said, that in the eight months since the court-approved administrator of the settlement began accepting claims, many players have been forced to spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had to keep, finding new doctors to confirm established diagnoses and lodging time-consuming appeals.

The requests, the league said, are part of its efforts to deter potential fraud and do not represent foot-dragging or a lack of will to help the sick men. But as a result, the players now accuse the nation’s richest league, with $14 billion in revenue, of trying to wear them down so they accept smaller payouts, or none at all.

“Players will be shorted what they earned,” said Andrew Stewart, a retired defensive lineman with Parkinson’s disease who expected to receive nearly $3 million but, after a series of delays and requests, has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing. “This is not a settlement. This is about paying sick men as little as possible.”

Stewart, who was in the league from 1989-93 and now lives in Canada, received a Parkinson’s diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two N.F.L. benefit plans. But to receive money from the settlement, he was required to get a diagnosis from an American doctor.

Alerted to some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled by lawyers for the players, Anita B. Brody, the federal judge overseeing the case, planned to meet with the N.F.L., the plaintiffs’ chief lawyer and a court-appointed administrator on Monday in Philadelphia to look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparently.

“Like an insurance company, they deny everything, and they go through a series of denials until people give up,” said Sheilla Dingus, who runs Advocacy for Fairness in Sports, an unaffiliated nonprofit group that monitors the league’s legal cases. “Unfortunately, the N.F.L. has the capital to keep this going a lot longer than some of these players will live.”

Orrin Brown, the court-approved administrator of the settlement, said it was common for the parties to settlements to fine-tune their agreements to account for issues that arise. He said that players are now, for instance, being asked to turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreement.

He said the bulk of the claims that have been sent back to players were for missing paperwork. But another group of claims have been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician, leading to questions of whether the players had been properly examined.

Brown said he understood that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion. But he said they were part of an effort to prevent fraud, not block real claims.

“It does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork,” Brown said. “But there’s nothing nefarious or conspiratorial in this. The goal is to make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claims.”

The former players who have filed claims are seeking up to $5 million each — though most will likely receive far less — for severe neurological diseases tied to years of head hits on the field. A total of 20,000 retired players registered so they can submit claims now or in the future from the settlement, which offers one-time cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumously.

Chris Seeger, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that the administration of such class-action settlements often had “growing pains” because of unanticipated problems. In this case, some former players have “pushed the envelope,” he said, by, among other things, obtaining diagnoses from psychologists, not neurologists; having doctors affirm diagnoses without examining patients; or submitting claims without the necessary medical records.

By bouncing claims back to players, the administrator is trying to address “some funny things that didn’t look right,” and to ensure that when claims are finally evaluated, they have a better chance of being approved, Seeger said.

Seeger disputes claims by lawyers who accuse the N.F.L. of foot-dragging and trying to reduce payments to players.

“Is this working perfectly? No,” Seeger said. But “if there aren’t sufficient records to support a diagnosis, then we have a problem. The procedures are laid out, but there is early on typically confusion. Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked out.”

Many lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation. The high number of claims that have been questioned, they said, is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way to keep down payouts.

“I worked at State Farm for 10 years, so I understand all the tactics,” said Patrick Tighe, a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players. “There are all sorts of ways to slow down the claims. Basically, they’re saying you need to start all over again, even if you have a pre-existing diagnosis” recognized by an N.F.L. benefit plan.

All 35 claims Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of “deficiencies,” he said. Jim Acho, a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players, including Gale Sayers, said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved, and that two of those were audited.

Jason Luckasevic, who represents dozens of former N.F.L. players, has filed more than 100 claims, and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficiencies.

“The settlement was sold by the N.F.L. and Seeger as quick pay,” Luckasevic said. “This was something everyone feared. This is the N.F.L. disability plan version 2.0.”

The N.F.L., which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement, denies that it has pushed the administrator to deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims, and it denies that stricter requirements were added after the deal was made final.

“There have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized,” Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said in a statement, adding that neither the league nor Seeger had taken any steps to delay the payment of legitimate claims.

The frustration among players is particularly acute for those whose neurological diseases were diagnosed years before the settlement was approved, and who are receiving benefits for those ailments from the N.F.L. under one of it regular disability plans. The delays are making it harder for them to cover escalating medical costs and, in some cases, to repay high-interest loans they took out using their settlement as collateral.

Yet many players are afraid to speak publicly about their cases because they fear the N.F.L. will deny their claims or strip them of other benefits.

Stewart, one of the few who would talk, said the league must be held accountable. He was found to have Parkinson’s disease in 2009, when he was 43.

Stewart expected to receive a gross award of $2.8 million from the concussions settlement. But after he filed a claim, he was told that another doctor had to confirm his diagnosis.

The new diagnosis, though, would have applied to his current age, 51, which would have reduced his award by $1.2 million because in the settlement, older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related to age, not football.

After Stewart submitted much additional paperwork, the administrator recognized the earlier diagnosis. But the award was reduced to $750,000 because the administrator calculated he had played only one season, not four.

In the settlement, the more eligible seasons a player has, the higher the exposure and the higher the award. But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed to head hits then.

Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career. But in his day, coaches forced him to keep practicing — often with the aid of painkillers — so he was exposed to head hits even if he did not play on game day.

In many ways, the N.F.L. case is different from many settlements, experts said. Most settlements describe the kinds of documents to support claims, like a credit card number or a receipt. In the N.F.L. settlement, many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia, which can be complicated to diagnose because it is more subjective than, say, A.L.S.

Because awards can reach millions of dollars, the players’ lawyers — many of whom receive a percentage any settlement — have an incentive to make their clients look worse than they may be, a reason for the N.F.L. to be alert to fraud, experts said.

Indeed, when the deal was first announced in 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to pay $765 million. But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed, so the league agreed to “uncap” payments. In return for unlimited liability, the N.F.L. insisted on stronger rules to block fraudulent claims.

But the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant to do more than fight fraud.

Kenneth Feinberg, who has administered large class-action settlements, including those related to the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said that in the cases he has handled, defendants have a right to try to prevent fraud.

“It’s not just how many claims have been found eligible, but how quickly the money goes out the door,” said Feinberg, who is not involved in the N.F.L. case. “All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity, and checks flowing to families in need.”",Debilitated Players Accuse N.F.L. of Stalling on Settlement Payments,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/sports/football/nfl-concussion-lawsuit.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

Most of the region’s fishermen, who have been out of work since the ban, poach totoaba swim bladders, which fetch $3,000 to $10,000 per kilogram, said Andrea Crosta, the director of a group that investigates the totoaba trade. An equivalent catch of shrimp might earn a fisherman $200 at best.

“If you’re out here on the water, you’re not risking jail time to catch shrimp,” said Dave Bader, a spokesman for Vaquita CPR.

After the death of the captured vaquita, the scientists agreed to shut down the program. “The evidence today is vaquita are not good candidates for being protected in this way,” Dr. Smith said. “It’s heartbreaking.”

The scientists had hoped to keep the animals in captivity temporarily, and possibly even breed them, until gill nets were eliminated from their habitat. While any wild animal is expected to experience some stress when captured, the group had hoped the vaquita could cope with being handled. (Last month, the scientists released a vaquita calf they had pulled from the waters when they determined it was too young to be separated from its mother.)

Other conservationists had been critical of the plan. “I was telling them that this was going to happen, you’re going to stress out the animals,” said Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd conservation group, which also works to protect vaquitas. “They are very elusive, they are very shy; you’re going to kill one of them.”

Mr. Crosta said that while he admired the work of the biologists, they couldn’t possibly solve a problem “that starts in San Felipe and ends in a shop in China.” The fate of the vaquita, he said, was “entirely in the hands of law enforcement.”

In the past two years, Sea Shepherd and local groups have recovered more than 25,000 yards of gill nets from the gulf, weighing about 50 tons. Now that efforts to capture the vaquitas have failed, conservationists say hauling in the poachers’ nets is the best bet to save the species from extinction.

The Mexican government, conservationists say, also needs to crack down on illegal fishing, while providing sustainable alternatives for the community. Financial compensation from the government often never makes it into the hands of the fishermen, diverted by corruption, Mr. Crosta said.

Local economies are an important consideration in conservation biology, Dr. Rojas-Bracho said. “You cannot save vaquita, and drive fishers to extinction.”",30 Vaquita Porpoises Are Left. One Died in a Rescue Mission.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/climate/vaquita-porpoise-dies.html

Early last month, President Trump visited Puerto Rico on a trip designed to signal the federal government’s recognition of the unfolding catastrophe from Hurricane Maria. When the hurricane crashed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it cut off electricity to nearly all of the island’s 3.4 million residents, destroyed 80 percent of the agricultural supply, knocked out cellular phone service, blocked roads, decimated homes and left at least 1.7 million people without potable water.

Such extensive breakdowns in what engineers call “lifeline systems” would have been devastating in any American state or city. Puerto Rico, a bankrupt commonwealth where nearly half of all residents live below the poverty line and some 650,000 are age 65 or older, was especially vulnerable.

But instead of pledging support for a large-scale emergency relief plan, Mr. Trump declared that Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe” and complained that the storm had “thrown our budget a little out of whack.” He announced that the official death toll from the hurricane, merely 16 at the time, was the true measure of the government’s response. “We saved a lot of lives,” he boasted, and then flew back home.

The statements were stunningly tone deaf. Morgues and funeral homes were calling for help dealing with the bodies piling up around their facilities. Scores of people who lived and died alone were sure to be discovered when roads reopened. Nearly everyone, regardless of class or status, was stranded, suffering and afraid. But federal officials, following Mr. Trump’s lead, continued to insist that the mortality level was minuscule.

Now that narrative has collapsed. On Thursday, Puerto Rican officials announced that 472 more people died there in September 2017 than in September 2016. That figure, which epidemiologists call the excess death toll, is a more reliable measure of the disaster’s human impact than the initial figure of 16 that Mr. Trump cited, because it includes cases that medical examiners could not process in the immediate aftermath of the storm.

In theory, it’s possible that the excess death toll will go down when October’s mortality statistics come in; perhaps Hurricane Maria killed mostly people who would have lived only a few weeks or months anyway. But the record from similar disasters suggests that this is unlikely.

He showed no sign of leaving the race ahead of Alabama’s Dec. 12 special election date.

In an afternoon statement, Mr. Moore’s campaign described Ms. Allred as “a sensationalist leading a witch hunt, and she is only around to create a spectacle.” The statement, issued before Ms. Allred’s news conference in New York, denied again “any sexual misconduct with anyone” by Mr. Moore.

Republicans here and in Alabama have been up in arms over the accusations, published last week in The Washington Post, that Mr. Moore pursued sexual or romantic relationships with teenagers when he was in his 30s. The reports have upended a race in a state that has not elected a Democratic senator in 25 years.

In a fund-raising appeal, Mr. Moore reached out to his supporters with the subject line: “Mitch McConnell’s plot to destroy me.”

“Apparently Mitch McConnell and the establishment G.O.P. would rather elect a radical pro-abortion Democrat than a conservative Christian,” he wrote.

And Mr. Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, lashed out in a Facebook post on Monday, complaining about “a witch hunt” in Alabama and claiming that “we are gathering evidence of money being paid to people who would come forward.”

“Washington establishment and Democrat Party will stop at nothing to stop our campaign,” she wrote. “Prayers appreciated.....”

But with Mr. McConnell now firmly against his election, Mr. Moore and his candidacy promise to deepen the divide between Republican leaders in Congress and the populist wing of the party that is standing by the Alabamian. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also called for Mr. Moore to drop out of the race on Monday.

Anxious Republican officials spent much of the weekend trying to determine what, if anything, they could do to halt Mr. Moore without simply turning over the seat. If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins, it would narrow the Republican advantage in the Senate to a single seat.

But if Mr. Moore stays in and goes on to win, it could leave Senate Republicans with the difficult question of whether to stop him from being seated or seating him and immediately moving to expel him from the chamber.

One idea now being discussed under this scenario, brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, would be for Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama to immediately appoint Attorney General Jeff Sessions to what had been his seat when it becomes vacant again. Mr. Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but his relationship with President Trump has waned since he recused himself from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year’s campaign.

Republicans in Washington, though, have not ruled out fielding a write-in candidate and some of the party’s outside groups were expected to conduct surveys this week of who would be most formidable prospect, according to officials familiar with the plans.

Democrats, who have been restrained about their prospects in such a conservative state, said that if additional women like the one joining Ms. Allred tell their stories, it would undermine Mr. Moore’s case that he is being smeared in a single newspaper article.

“The more people that come out of the woodwork, the more women with similar stories, the more credible it becomes,” said Zac McCrary, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster. “It’s going to become easier to see through Roy Moore’s non-denial denials.”

Democrats have begun raising money in earnest for Mr. Jones, a former prosecutor who sent Ku Klux Klansmen to jail for the infamous Birmingham church bombing of 1963 that killed four young girls.

Her boyfriend was late that night to pick her up after work, she said, and Mr. Moore offered her a ride home. Ms. Nelson said that instead of driving her home, Mr. Moore drove to the back of the restaurant, parked his vehicle and forced himself on her.

Ms. Allred displayed a yearbook she and Ms. Nelson said is signed by Mr. Moore.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005.
Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder.","The deal was done at a crossroads.

There, according to legend, the bluesman Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for otherworldly musical prowess — guitar playing, singing and songwriting that would make him an idol, still studied and revered almost 80 years after his death.

Zeke Schein came to a crossroads, too, when he bought an old photo (Slide 1) that he believes is only the third known image of Johnson. Johnson’s family, a prominent forensic expert and musicians who’ve been transformed by the bluesman’s recordings agreed with Mr. Schein. But skeptics questioned the likeness, the date — even Mr. Schein’s motives.

Intent on defending himself and the image, Mr. Schein began a journey to learn more about the sharp-dressed men in the sepia print. He chronicles his search in “Portrait of a Phantom: The Story of Robert Johnson’s Lost Photograph,” a book he co-wrote with Poppy Z. Brite, recently published by Pelican.

He talked about the book at another crossroads, Matt Umanov Guitars, a Greenwich Village landmark where he has worked since 1989. He wrote that the store is such a magnet that “if you sit at the front counter of Matt Umanov Guitars, the world comes to you.” Since we began this conversation Matt decided to close the store after 53 years. Zeke put on his walking shoes, and moved on to Rudy’s, his next crossroads.

Mr. Schein discovered the photo while searching for old guitars on eBay. The 3-inch-by-4-inch print from sheet film wasn’t in great shape – “The photo looked haunted, like it had been to hell and back,” he wrote. But when Mr. Schein saw it, he immediately believed that the man holding the guitar was Johnson.

With help from Tom Crandall, a friend in the store’s repair shop, Mr. Schein won the auction in 2005. Mr. Schein was familiar with vintage and vernacular photography. He makes photographs as well as plays music, with a deep appreciation of the tools of each form, since before selling guitars, he’d sold cameras and worked in a lab. He immediately thought the image was a contact print from sheet film, likely done with a Speed Graphic, because of the sharpness.

“Looking at the paper,” Mr. Schein said, “I could tell it was that cheaper, crumbly paper that you would see in old photo albums, photos of maybe my grandparents and even early photos of my father would be on that type of paper.” He dated it to the 1930s. Johnson died in 1938.

Photo

“And then if you look at the print, if you see it online, you’ll see that the edges are black,” Mr. Schein said. “It’s not masked. So you’re not seeing white edging on there — you’re seeing what looks like a negative which was laid down flat.” (A negative’s clear edge comes out black on a contact-sheet print.)

Mr. Schein also guessed that the man in the lighter suit in the photo was Johnny Shines, another blues legend who died in 1992. Mr. Schein later learned of a documentary about Johnson, “Can’t You Hear the Wind Howl?” in which Shines said that there was a photo of him and Johnson taken in 1937 by a photographer named Johnnie Mae Crowder in Hughes, Ark., and that it ran in a local newspaper. If the two were posing for a newspaper photographer, she might very well have used a Speed Graphic, which was standard equipment then.

After showing the photo to friends and musicians who, like Mr. Schein, knew intimately the details of the two authenticated photos of Johnson, many agreed that he’d discovered a third image. Trouble was, when he showed the photo to two old Delta bluesmen, David “Honeyboy” Edwards and Robert Lockwood Jr., who’d both known Johnson, neither of them recognized the man holding the guitar.

Skeptics questioned whether the photo was from the 1930s, since it looked as if the man on the right wore a zoot suit, a 1940s fashion fad featuring wide lapels and shoulders and high-waisted baggy pants. But the style was based on the “drape suit” worn by African-Americans a decade earlier; in the 1933 film “International House,” Cab Calloway’s band wore similar suits.

Some also have suggested that the photo was reversed, since the man in the light suit wore his watch on his right wrist and the man in the dark suit has a pocket square on the right side of his jacket, rather than the left. If the photo is flipped, this meant Johnson is holding the guitar as a left-handed player, not a righty. But since the guitar is stringless, it could have been a studio prop, so it wouldn’t matter how Johnson held it.

More people joined the search. Frank DiGiacomo, who wrote about Mr. Schein’s photo for Vanity Fair in 2008, showed a copy to Claud Johnson, Robert’s son, who agreed that it was his father.

A lawyer for the Johnson estate sent a copy of the photo to Lois Gibson, a forensic specialist who had identified the sailor in Alfred Eisenstaedt’s famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square at the end of World War II. She said that the man holding the guitar in Mr. Schein’s photo appeared to be Johnson.

The Vanity Fair piece seemed only to spur attacks on the photo and criticism of Mr. Schein, with some accusing him of pushing it for financial gain, even though he’d assigned the copyright to the Johnson estate.

“We do all share a love of that music and we all play it, including writers and historians who decided to attack what I was doing and also question the integrity — my integrity — in what I was doing and that of the Johnson family,” Mr. Schein said. “They were accusing us of only being in it for money, which was never the goal for either of us. I needed to at least explain my position, why I cared so much about trying to put out a musician’s image who affected me.”

Despite years of investigations, more needs to be done. Mr. Schein has been unable to look for other photos taken by Johnnie Mae Crowder. “I stumbled on this one,“ he said. “I don’t have the skill set to go further than I did.”

But maybe you do.

“In a wild-hopes situation — wildest hopes — I hope someone reads my story and has the knowledge and experience to take my research and what I’ve been able to do a step further.”

And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises.
Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated.
Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves.
This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr.","We know that love is dangerous, because it requires facing one’s own brokenness and vulnerability. Yet both of our nations are morally broken, imperfect. So we speak with the impassioned words of Mahatma Gandhi: “I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.”

This letter fervently asks more from you and from the United States. The writer James Baldwin, one of our most prophetic voices, wrote: “One can give nothing whatever without giving oneself — that is to say, risking oneself. If one cannot risk oneself, then one is simply incapable of giving.” Neither of our nations has much to give the other because each has failed to risk itself. And it is out of our collective and respective cowardice — our refusal to risk, to love and to combat our mutual cynicism — that this letter of love arises. It serves as an intervention as we face the potential horrors of unspeakable mass death. We stand with our brother Martin Luther King Jr., who refused “to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of nuclear annihilation.”

There are many here in the United States who will say that this letter is absurd, useless, even treasonous. Well, if love is treasonous, then we take joy in it. We revel in speaking out against hatred; inhumanity; divisiveness; discourse mired in immature name-calling; ugly, disparaging remarks; talk of destruction and obliteration; and the potential of miscalculation and nuclear conflagration. We prefer to stand on the “treasonous” side of Jesus, who dared to love.

We are traitors to those who reject mutual respect and who believe that there is no place for love as a binding force greater than mutual bullying and provocation. We are traitors to our country’s divisive rhetoric, filled with militarism, hatred, blood lust and warmongering, just as we stand opposed to yours, which threatens not only us, but also your neighbors — that is, your own brothers and sisters, and even your own people. As men of color, we know the semblance of that threat from within our own country.

To hate requires so little; to love requires doing what may feel impossible, because it means to lay down the sword and stretch out your hands, your arms, your hearts, to each other. Many will also criticize us, saying that love is too simplistic, that the problem between North Korea and the United States is too ideologically and geopolitically complicated. Those people fail to imagine with their hearts. Dr. King said: “We are inevitably our brother’s keeper because we are our brother’s brother. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” And Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, another prophetic American voice of love, asked us, “How many disasters do we have to go through in order to realize that all of humanity has a stake in the liberty of one person; whenever one person is offended, we are all hurt.”

That kind of love refuses to hate, it refuses to believe that we are “enemies” by birth. We are brothers and sisters born of a common humanity. We believe in a love that remembers the humanity that binds us together, that opens us to hear the other’s voice, the other’s mourning. Then again, perhaps Baldwin was correct, “There are too many things we do not wish to know about ourselves.” Yet we believe that reciprocal love can take us to that place together and heal our wounds.

David Kyuman Kim: These feel like especially loveless times. We write from the conviction that the values of a love-driven politics can transform how we engage each other not only as nations but also as human beings. Which is to say, a love-driven politics insists that we seek compassion, generosity, kindness, forgiveness and mercy for each other as much as we do for ourselves.

Our president was elected to represent our people, but he has not represented the best of us. He has instead chosen to display only our basest traits. While he is not the first president to speak and act with hubris and arrogance, he has chosen belligerence over diplomacy, bullying over accord, insult over care. He represents a strand and strain of the American experiment that stubbornly holds on to the misguided notion that we are a nation of destiny and superiority, strengthened on legacies of white supremacy and rapacious capitalism. He has exacted those misguided ideals by treating you with disrespect and disregard, all the while belittling you as a leader of your own people, and you, in turn have done the same.

As a Korean-American, I have to acknowledge you both as one of my people and very much not of my people. My mother’s family is from North Korea, and so in some very real ways, you and I are of common stock. But a land does not make for family. If anything, you and your father have shown how land and nation can destroy families and traumatize them for generations. You are the leader of a nation whose people have suffered at the service of a political vision. At what cost has your loyalty to power come to your people, let alone to your humanity?

My mother’s family fled North Korea because of the forces of war that are all too similar to the enmities that are threatening us today. And it was the consequences of the Korean War and the havoc it wreaked on my people in South Korea that eventually drove my family to the United States. And through this migration and growing up in white-supremacist America, I was transformed from our common stock to a Korean-American dedicated to the ways of love.

Indeed, as a Korean brother I have been forged by my inheritance from Christianity and Confucianism. This means that my witness to you is born of traditions of love and ethical responsibility. Among the very real and central challenges of radical love is to adhere to the moral mandate to love our neighbors and enemies as we would love ourselves. This is especially challenging at a moment in which love has been hard to find and discern. For those of us who lament the ascendancy of our current president, we have had to learn how to love ourselves once again.

We write you today not only because of what you are hearing from us — the United States — but, more important, because of all the crucial things you are not hearing. As defenders of civil rights against racism, we come from a tradition not well represented or well understood, yet one that has transformed the course of our nation’s history and the lives and legacies of peoples across the globe.

This is the tradition of radical love most powerfully and persuasively articulated and represented by Martin Luther King Jr. This is a tradition that insists that love has the power to bind us together in a common purpose, that love gives us the confidence and courage to stand up to injustice and suffering. It is a tradition that holds us accountable not simply to ourselves but to a vision of human existence that insists that we can be with one another, hold one another up, and fortify one another’s humanity in what Dr. King called “the beloved community.”

We reach out to you from this tradition that holds the value of speaking truth to power with love. This is a calling. It is our vocation. We have no choice but to strive to live up to the examples of Dr. King and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, of activists like Fannie Lou Hamer and Grace Lee Boggs. These heroic figures have been exceptions to the insidious rule of an American legacy of white supremacy and imperialism that has left the least among us in utter despair. This tradition of radical love is an American tradition, even though it has drawn deeply and powerfully from people like Gandhi and Thich Nhat Hanh.

We come to you as citizens of an America not yet fully realized, one that insists that the ways of love can be the ways of democracy, that the challenge of loving one’s neighbors and enemies is fundamentally a call for freedom and justice and hope. We write to you with love and an appeal for forgiveness and mercy because history and our lot demand this of us. And our hope is that it will demand the same of our fellow citizens.

Wishing you peace and love,

Menhaden have responded by returning in large numbers to New York, attracting the whales, striped bass, osprey and other species that feed on them.
At a meeting scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, the fisheries commission is considering several options for managing menhaden along the Eastern Seaboard, including one that would allow up to a 40 percent increase in the catch limit.
An increase that large would ignore the important role these fish play in ocean ecosystems.","Photo

Earlier this year, a couple of New Jersey anglers were fishing the waters near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge when a humpback whale nearly landed in their 19-foot boat. Their video of the encounter was watched hundreds of thousands of times and made national news, but most people likely missed one detail — the small fish that landed in the boat along with the whale.

Fishermen like myself, however, recognized it right away as an Atlantic menhaden. Anglers learn to look for that small fish, because we know that where we find menhaden, we’ll also find whales, striped bass and a wealth of other marine life. During my last striped bass fishing trip off the Rockaways, I was lucky enough to catch my fill of big stripers and see feeding by porpoises, osprey and humpbacks. It was a National Geographic experience just a few miles from Manhattan.

An important reason for bountiful catches like mine, many scientists believe, is the recovery of the menhaden, which began in 2013 after the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the government body that manages the species and others, enacted the first-ever catch limits for the fish, which is rendered into heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid fish oil and used to produce fertilizers and high-protein animal feeds. This reduced the menhaden harvest by 20 percent. Menhaden have responded by returning in large numbers to New York, attracting the whales, striped bass, osprey and other species that feed on them.

“Increasingly, we’re seeing what appears to be more abundant menhaden in our waters, and with that, we have increasing habitat of some of the large whales in some our waters,” Howard Rosenbaum, the director of the ocean giants program for the Wildlife Conservation Society, recently told the public radio show Science Friday. His organization has been studying whales in the New York Bight, the section of the Atlantic Ocean that stretches between Montauk Point on Long Island and Cape May, N.J.

Unfortunately, this progress is at risk.

At a meeting scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, the fisheries commission is considering several options for managing menhaden along the Eastern Seaboard, including one that would allow up to a 40 percent increase in the catch limit. An increase that large would ignore the important role these fish play in ocean ecosystems.

This is why many recreational fishermen, scientists, conservationists, whale and bird watchers and even chefs and scuba divers support a policy that would consider managing menhaden in the context of the species’ role as an important prey fish for predators. Doing so would set an important precedent for managing other so-called forage fish and would be a welcome departure from the present approach of narrowly focusing on how many fish of a particular species can be sustainably harvested.",How to Protect the Atlantic Fishery,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/opinion/protect-atlantic-fishery.html

So what would true reform look like? First, it would not blow a $1.7 trillion hole in the budget over the next decade, which is what the House plan would do, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Second, it would make the system fairer and more efficient. If Republicans worked with Democrats, they could reach a compromise to lower the top corporate tax rate to between 25 percent and 28 percent, eliminate loopholes and reduce the incentive businesses have to take on debt, rather than to use equity to expand. Under current law, interest is deductible for tax purposes while dividends are not.

Real reform would also include a minimum tax on profits earned abroad by American corporations in the year those profits are earned, minus a credit for taxes paid to other countries. Businesses can now defer taxes on such profits indefinitely, as long as they do not bring the money back to the United States. Big companies like Apple, General Electric and Microsoft have kept an astonishing $2.6 trillion in profits offshore, hoping Congress will lower the tax rate or give them a tax holiday to repatriate the money at ultralow rates. The House bill would let companies bring those profits home at 7 percent (for money invested in hard-to-sell assets) or 14 percent (for cash). A plausible compromise would let businesses repatriate all past profits accumulated overseas at a somewhat discounted rate, say 15 percent to 16 percent. All of this money could be used to rebuild America’s dilapidated infrastructure.

While the outlined changes would solve an immediate problem, Congress also needs to consider longer-term obstacles to tax avoidance by multinational companies. One smart idea that deserves more study is a proposal by economists like Kimberly Clausing, a professor at Reed College. She argues that the United States and other countries ought to tax profits that corporations earn from sales inside their borders, similar to the way American states now tax corporate profits. Each country would control its tax rates, deductions and credits. But companies would lose the ability to game the system by booking profits through subsidiaries registered in zero- or low-tax countries like Bermuda and Luxembourg, where they might be making few sales.

Eventually, Congress will need to do more than just patch the tax system. Even without the Republican tax cut plans, the Congressional Budget Office expects the federal deficit to grow to 5.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, up from 3.2 percent in 2016, thanks in part to the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq war. Lawmakers will need to consider new sources of revenue, including a value-added tax, a carbon tax and a financial transactions tax. Each would broaden the tax base and achieve important policy goals, like encouraging savings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing risks in the financial system.

The Republican proposals do none of these things. They do, however, reward the wealthy. Among the worst offenders is the proposed corporate tax cut, which is larger than needed and does nothing to make the system more efficient. The victims here are the economy as a whole and the workers and ordinary folk to whom Mr. Trump promised relief.",The Right Way to Cut Corporate Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/corporate-tax-cuts-gop.html

Even those who applaud the aim of reducing the corporate tax rate and transforming the way global profits are taxed worry that specific provisions will miss the mark.

Republican leaders, responding to political pressure to move quickly, defend the process, saying Congress has held dozens of hearings on tax reform in recent years.

Tax bills, by nature complex, are shaped by a galaxy of competing pressures. And withholding details until the final vote as a way of shielding the legislation from special interests is not a new strategy.

Yet several veterans of previous tax battles argue what is different this time is the mix of breakneck speed and enormous scope.

Consider the plan’s shift from a worldwide system, where profits are taxed no matter where they are earned, to a territorial system, which exempts profits earned outside the United States, bringing the American tax system in line with those in most other nations.

Because the switch could end up encouraging American companies to move even more profits offshore to avoid paying any domestic income tax, both the House and Senate versions of the bill impose rules to deter most multinationals with annual revenues of more than $100 million from exploiting such tactics.

But the effort to catch the giants under the new territorial system sets a financial bar that small and medium-size businesses can limbo under. Mr. Shay said accounting firms were likely to start marketing off-the-shelf tax shelters allowing companies to set up foreign offices in low-tax countries like Bermuda or Luxembourg to shrink their tax bills.

“They’re just opening us up to the next round of tax shelters on the international side,” he said. “And the I.R.S., underfunded as it is, isn’t going to be able to check anything.”

At the same time, he said, some safeguards aimed at multinationals could still be bypassed. To reduce their home tax bill, companies like Google and Pfizer, for instance, often relocate patents and copyrights in tax havens and then sell use of that intellectual property back to their American subsidiaries at eye-popping prices. These are the higher-than-normal profits — which Senate bill drafters have cunningly called “Gilti” (for global intangible low-tax income) — that Republican bills are trying to stop from leaking out of the tax system.

Multinationals, though, could avoid some of the Gilti tax by shifting more tangible property like production and research facilities abroad.

Other problems arise from the push to reduce the rate on pass-through businesses (sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate). Lawmakers have advertised the cut as relief for smaller businesses, but high-income investors in hedge and private-equity funds could use the provision to reduce the tax paid on rent and interest income by as much as a third.

Hedge-fund investors have an additional opportunity for a windfall with a simple reporting technique, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and former legislation counsel with Congress’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. The funds’ decision to mark their trading positions at their market price (instead of their initial purchase price) would enable any gains to qualify for pass-through treatment at the newly reduced rate of 25 percent instead of being treated as short-term capital gains, at a top rate that nears 40 percent.

The pass-through changes present other tax dodges. Benefits for pass-throughs that provide services — like doctors, lawyers and accountants — are supposed to be phased out for individuals with incomes above $75,000 and for married couples with income above $150,000. But a firm could skirt that limit by creating multiple partnerships with different functions, with one providing services, and the other handling, say, licensing or leasing, said Dan Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School who helped write the 1986 tax overhaul.

“There is not a single advantage this has, except for students of people like me, who will get paid more to figure out how to game the system,” he said.

Individual proposals that might make sense on their own can also set off unintended consequences when paired together. Although the Senate’s plan to wait until 2019 to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent has infuriated some shareholders, it saves money so that Congress can reach its budget goals. Some tax experts go further and argue that any cut should be phased in over a 10-year period to smooth out investment and reduce windfall gains.

Yet enacting a 20 percent corporate tax rate to take effect one year in advance while allowing investors to immediately deduct their expenses at 35 percent operates like a subsidy, and could encourage investing in money-losing projects simply for a tax gain.

“That could lead to silly stuff where you have a loss before the tax, but a gain after the tax,” Mr. Shaviro said.

(He offered an example for the mathematically inclined. Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet. So even though your investment lost $10, you are still coming out ahead: with $72 on a net investment of $65.)

Other experts pointed to constantly shifting cost estimates of proposals that suddenly gained or lost tens of billions of dollars overnight.

At the end of 10 years, the very safeguards that are supposed to prevent international tax avoidance actually lose money, according to the Joint Committee’s revenue estimates of the House bill, said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College. “This is a big giveaway in future years,” she said. “On net, the whole system is ineffective.”

The shortcomings are fixable to some degree, critics say, but the Republican strategy of pushing through a bill without Democratic votes before the end of the year — on tax rules that take effect a few weeks later — will not leave sufficient time.

To some supporters, though, that’s the price of success.

“Will they find things that need to be fixed afterward because the process was moving so fast? Yes,” said Rachelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel at the National Retail Federation, which represents big chains like Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue.

But there are always technical corrections to tax bills after they pass, Ms. Bernstein said, and retailers have been waiting so long for a corporate rate cut that they don’t mind if it finally happens with an imperfect bill.

Early last month, President Trump visited Puerto Rico on a trip designed to signal the federal government’s recognition of the unfolding catastrophe from Hurricane Maria. When the hurricane crashed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, it cut off electricity to nearly all of the island’s 3.4 million residents, destroyed 80 percent of the agricultural supply, knocked out cellular phone service, blocked roads, decimated homes and left at least 1.7 million people without potable water.

Such extensive breakdowns in what engineers call “lifeline systems” would have been devastating in any American state or city. Puerto Rico, a bankrupt commonwealth where nearly half of all residents live below the poverty line and some 650,000 are age 65 or older, was especially vulnerable.

But instead of pledging support for a large-scale emergency relief plan, Mr. Trump declared that Hurricane Maria was not a “real catastrophe” and complained that the storm had “thrown our budget a little out of whack.” He announced that the official death toll from the hurricane, merely 16 at the time, was the true measure of the government’s response. “We saved a lot of lives,” he boasted, and then flew back home.

The statements were stunningly tone deaf. Morgues and funeral homes were calling for help dealing with the bodies piling up around their facilities. Scores of people who lived and died alone were sure to be discovered when roads reopened. Nearly everyone, regardless of class or status, was stranded, suffering and afraid. But federal officials, following Mr. Trump’s lead, continued to insist that the mortality level was minuscule.

Now that narrative has collapsed. On Thursday, Puerto Rican officials announced that 472 more people died there in September 2017 than in September 2016. That figure, which epidemiologists call the excess death toll, is a more reliable measure of the disaster’s human impact than the initial figure of 16 that Mr. Trump cited, because it includes cases that medical examiners could not process in the immediate aftermath of the storm.

Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency’s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.

Mr. Snowden’s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.

Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.

American officials had to explain to close allies — and to business leaders in the United States — how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.

Inside the agency’s Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency’s arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs — including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.’s leaked tools.

“It’s a disaster on multiple levels,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.”

In response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency “cannot comment on Shadow Brokers.” He denied that the episode had hurt morale. “N.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,” he said.

Compounding the pain for the N.S.A. is the attackers’ regular online public taunts, written in ersatz broken English. Their posts are a peculiar mash-up of immaturity and sophistication, laced with profane jokes but also savvy cultural and political references. They suggest that their author — if not an American — knows the United States well.

“Is NSA chasing shadowses?” the Shadow Brokers asked in a post on Oct. 16, mocking the agency’s inability to understand the leaks and announcing a price cut for subscriptions to its “monthly dump service” of stolen N.S.A. tools. It was a typically wide-ranging screed, touching on George Orwell’s “1984”; the end of the federal government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30; Russia’s creation of bogus accounts on Facebook and Twitter; and the phenomenon of American intelligence officers going to work for contractors who pay higher salaries.

One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers’ identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. “Russian security peoples,” it said, “is becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.”

Russia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.

Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?

Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.

“We have had a train wreck coming,” said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. “We should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.”

America’s Cyber Special Forces

At the heart of the N.S.A. crisis is Tailored Access Operations, the group where Mr. Williams worked, which was absorbed last year into the agency’s new Directorate of Operations.

Photo

T.A.O. — the outdated name is still used informally — began years ago as a side project at the agency’s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington’s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.

The hacking unit attracts many of the agency’s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources — say, a Chinese official’s home computer or a Russian oil company’s network. Much of T.A.O.’s work is labeled E.C.I., for “exceptionally controlled information,” material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.’s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.

The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work “challenging and sometimes exciting.”

T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. “The nature of the business is to move with the technology,” a former T.A.O. hacker said.

Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants — computer code designed to find material of interest — left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.

The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.’s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.

It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.

Like cops studying a burglar’s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 — a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.’s collection, including three so-called ops disks — T.A.O.’s term for tool kits — containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.

But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.

Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies — hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.’s defenses — because, as one put it, “I know we’ve done it to other countries.”

The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.

He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.

“That feels like a betrayal,” he said. “I was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.”

The Hunt for an Insider

For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. — No Such Agency, in the old joke — was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.

The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library’s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.

The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have Russian hackers lift them from his home computer; and Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.

Mr. Martin’s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.

But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.’s Vault7 breaches.

Then there are the Shadow Brokers’ writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: “Don’t Forget Your Base.” With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the “deep state”; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.

“TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,” the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. “TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.”

The mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique — nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble — the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.

Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A’s mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including “graybeards” they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.

“Snowden killed morale,” another T.A.O. analyst said. “But at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they’re liars.”

Because the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds. Trust has eroded as anyone who had access to the leaked code is regarded as the potential culprit.

Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.

“How much longer are the releases going to come?” a former T.A.O. employee asked. “The agency doesn’t know how to stop it — or even what ‘it’ is.”

One N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.

But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers’s agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies’ findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral’s time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.

A Shadow War With Russia?

Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials’ strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.

But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.

Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia’s state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.

In the meantime, Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.

Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky’s efforts to find and retrieve the N.S.A.’s secrets wherever they could be found. The T.A.O. hackers knew that when Kaspersky updated its popular antivirus software to find and block the N.S.A. malware, it could thwart spying operations around the world.

So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.

In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group — the company’s name for T.A.O. hackers — and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.

As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.

On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers’ name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.

“We hack Equation Group,” the Shadow Brokers wrote. “We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.”

Inside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency’s hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.

The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.

Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said — because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a “dead man’s switch” to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.

“We’re obviously dealing with people who have operational security knowledge,” he said. “They have the whole law enforcement system and intelligence system after them. And they haven’t been caught.”",Security Breach and Spilled Secrets Have Shaken the N.S.A. to Its Core,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency’s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.

Mr. Snowden’s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.

Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.

American officials had to explain to close allies — and to business leaders in the United States — how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.

Inside the agency’s Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency’s arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs — including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.’s leaked tools.

“It’s a disaster on multiple levels,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.”

In response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency “cannot comment on Shadow Brokers.” He denied that the episode had hurt morale. “N.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,” he said.

Compounding the pain for the N.S.A. is the attackers’ regular online public taunts, written in ersatz broken English. Their posts are a peculiar mash-up of immaturity and sophistication, laced with profane jokes but also savvy cultural and political references. They suggest that their author — if not an American — knows the United States well.

“Is NSA chasing shadowses?” the Shadow Brokers asked in a post on Oct. 16, mocking the agency’s inability to understand the leaks and announcing a price cut for subscriptions to its “monthly dump service” of stolen N.S.A. tools. It was a typically wide-ranging screed, touching on George Orwell’s “1984”; the end of the federal government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30; Russia’s creation of bogus accounts on Facebook and Twitter; and the phenomenon of American intelligence officers going to work for contractors who pay higher salaries.

One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers’ identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. “Russian security peoples,” it said, “is becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.”

Russia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.

Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?

Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.

“We have had a train wreck coming,” said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. “We should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.”

America’s Cyber Special Forces

At the heart of the N.S.A. crisis is Tailored Access Operations, the group where Mr. Williams worked, which was absorbed last year into the agency’s new Directorate of Operations.

T.A.O. — the outdated name is still used informally — began years ago as a side project at the agency’s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington’s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.

The hacking unit attracts many of the agency’s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources — say, a Chinese official’s home computer or a Russian oil company’s network. Much of T.A.O.’s work is labeled E.C.I., for “exceptionally controlled information,” material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.’s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.

The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work “challenging and sometimes exciting.”

T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. “The nature of the business is to move with the technology,” a former T.A.O. hacker said.

Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants — computer code designed to find material of interest — left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.

The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.’s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.

It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.

Like cops studying a burglar’s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 — a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.’s collection, including three so-called ops disks — T.A.O.’s term for tool kits — containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.

Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.

But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.

Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies — hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.’s defenses — because, as one put it, “I know we’ve done it to other countries.”

The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.

He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.

“That feels like a betrayal,” he said. “I was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.”

The Hunt for an Insider

For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. — No Such Agency, in the old joke — was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.

The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library’s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.

The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have Russian hackers lift them from his home computer; and Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.

Mr. Martin’s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.

But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.’s Vault7 breaches.

The vocal demands are a workout for almost every performer onstage.

“The note,” Mr. Adès said, “the range, the tessitura, is a metaphor for the ability to transcend these psychological and invisible boundaries that have grown up around them.”

Adding to the excitement of the high A is its placement in the score. Unlike in other high-flying parts — the imperious Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute,” the spunky Zerbinetta in “Ariadne auf Naxos,” the long-suffering title role in “Lucia di Lammermoor” — there’s little time for Ms. Luna to warm up: The A is her very first note, sung before she’s even visible onstage. (She sings it again a short time later, as the party guests, in a surreal portent, leave the stage and re-enter.)

“It’s a moment of arrival,” Mr. Adès said. “It had to be on this note.”

Growing up in Oregon, Ms. Luna sang the daunting Queen of the Night when she was still in high school “just because it was fun,” she said. “And I liked the sensation it made in my bones, in my head, in my sinuses. It just gave me a high. It still gives me a high.”

Her topmost register is unusually lucid and effortless. Even in those notes unattainable by most other sopranos, and even when those notes are held far longer than the pecks requested by most other composers, Ms. Luna’s tone is full. She manages to avoid shrillness in what she aptly calls the “Wagnerian coloratura spectacle” that is her final “Exterminating Angel” aria, a flood of sustained superhigh sound up to F.

Even if nothing in previous Met history has equaled her high A, other singers have come close, sometimes adding unwritten interpolations and transpositions to show off their personal stratospheres. A number of the highest notes in Met history have emerged from sopranos singing the title part in “Lucia di Lammermoor”; it’s no coincidence that this is the role Ms. Luna’s character performs just before the dinner party at the start of “The Exterminating Angel.”

Ellen Beach Yaw, born near Buffalo in 1869, sang a G above C as Lucia in her single Met performance in 1908. The review in The New York Times praised her “flutelike Santos-Dumont notes,” comparing her to a Brazilian aviation pioneer, and added, in a reference to a Wild West gunslinger: “She hit that high G as promised, but it is like Bat Masterson hitting a tomato can with a .44 at four paces.”

The celebrated French soprano Lily Pons sustained a high F in the final mad scene from “Lucia” — sung, at her Met debut in 1931, “in legitimate note, not bird whistles or falsetto,” according to The New York Post. At the turn of the 20th century, Sibyl Sanderson, as Massenet’s Manon, hit a G, known as her “Eiffel Tower note.” Mado Robin, a French coloratura, was recorded shrilling up to a B flat, but she never sang at the Met.

More recently, Natalie Dessay was known in New York for her crystal-clear G’s as the mechanical doll Olympia in Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann.” Just this fall, Erin Morley’s Olympia ornaments brought her up to A flat, a feat Rachele Gilmore achieved in the role at the Met in 2009.

The company admits it is possible that an even higher note could have slipped through the archival cracks. “There’s no record keeping of such things, especially of improvised stuff,” said Peter Clark, the Met’s archivist, who remembers hearing Pons’s F on a radio broadcast as a child. “So it’s not to say that in 1908, say, something higher didn’t happen. But I doubt that it wouldn’t be mentioned somewhere.”

“The Exterminating Angel” isn’t the first time Mr. Adès has pushed a singer to extremes, nor was “The Tempest.” In fact, one of his very first works, “Five Eliot Landscapes” for soprano and piano, from 1990, ends on a sustained G flat.

“It’s a certain amount of useful cruelty involved,” he said with a chuckle, before correcting himself. “Not cruelty, but the callowness of youth.”

Callow or not, he’s still at it. Mr. Adès said that in the score of “The Tempest,” which had its premiere in London in 2004, he had placed a high G in brackets, indicating a note that at the time he only dreamed of hearing.

When she sang the part at the Met, Ms. Luna could reach the G. Now, more than a decade later, the score of “The Exterminating Angel” has a high B in brackets — yet another seemingly impossible note, waiting patiently for a soprano who can crack yet another music-stave ceiling.","At the Met Opera, a Note So High, It’s Never Been Sung Before",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-high-note-exterminating-angel.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss

“For Trump supporters reflexively jumping to Moore’s defense, please stop making stupid arguments. You are hurting the president.”

Mr. Jennings, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has a novel idea for how President Trump should respond to allegations against Roy S. Moore. The president should encourage the Alabama Republican party to withdraw Mr. Moore’s name from the slot, and urge voters to write in Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the position he left behind. It’ll be “zigging when everyone thinks he’s going to zag,” Mr. Jennings argues. Read more »

David Harsanyi in The Federalist:

“ ‘Due process’ shouldn’t be code for ‘Let’s dismiss anything inconvenient to our political fortunes.’ This isn’t a criminal proceeding.”

Mr. Harsanyi has a healthy dose of skepticism about the mainstream media, writing that “the establishment media gave former presidents and senators who were likely sexual predators virtual free passes for decades.” But that doesn’t dissuade him from considering The Washington Post’s article chronicling Mr. Moore’s alleged relationships with teenagers to be a “credible” and “solid piece of journalism.” It is fair, argues Mr. Harsanyi, to support Mr. Moore based on policy — like his views on abortion — despite these accusations. “But don’t tell me you’re sure Roy Moore is innocent.” Read more »

David French in National Review:



“Roy Moore will not lose his life, liberty, or property if voters reject his bid for high office.”

Mr. French reminds his readers that “Constitutional protections for due process apply when the state is attempting to deprive a person of ‘life, liberty, or property.’ ” It does not apply when you are at risk of being deprived of a seat in government. Just as it is “entirely fair for voters to analyze the available facts about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal [...] without waiting for the outcome of a civil or criminal proceeding,” so is it entirely fair to voters to assess Mr. Moore’s character based on reports in The Washington Post. People who know better, he writes, are disingenuously calling for due process, knowing full well that “it’s a good way to coax good people into ignoring problematic claims while soothing their guilty conscience.” Read more »

A mix of fresh ambition and the familiar has come to define this diverse neighborhood, where less than 10 percent of the population traces its ancestry to Australia or England. It is visible at places like the Usual Cafe, a modern coffee shop near John Street where baristas in denim pull shots against a background of lush plants and white tiles.

Corey Nguyen, 28, who grew up in Australia and owns the Usual with his partner, Jenny Ngo, said they wanted to introduce Cabramatta, which is dominated by traditional cafes selling Vietnamese-style coffee, to a more artisanal cafe culture.

“For us it’s never been a competition,” he said. “They do their thing, we do ours. I wish them all the best.”

It’s a good thing, said Andrew Nguyen, 24, who waited with a friend for his coffee after a traditional Vietnamese lunch. “All your Asian fixes are here,” he said. “It’s home to us.”

For many of Cabramatta’s first Vietnamese residents, it felt like anything but.

Before their arrival, the population was mostly working-class Australians and European migrants. A German-Austrian society center near the train station is one of a few remaining signs of that past.

During the ’70s, primarily American servicemen brought heroin to Sydney from Southeast Asia, said Andrew Jakubowicz, a professor of sociology at the University of Technology Sydney. Cabramatta, with its links to Italian criminal groups and a new connection to Southeast Asia, would soon become a distribution point for the rest of the city.

For the Vietnamese, harboring the lingering trauma of war, the lack of an established Asian community in Cabramatta made it “a fairly desperate time,” Professor Jakubowicz said. “There was no history and structure available to respond to, and Australia was still very racist.”

One of those former refugees, Hue Kim, 75, now spends her weekends selling Kaffir lime leaves, rosemary and other herbs on the sidewalk just a few feet from Ms. Nguyen’s bubble tea shop.

She remembers attending her first English class shortly after arriving, pregnant, in Sydney 37 years ago. Her teachers, she said, noticed that her shirt was stained with milk. “They told me to nurse my newborn before coming back,” she said in Vietnamese. “So I didn’t go back.”

Many of the Vietnamese children who came during this time were unaccompanied. Others were left to their own devices while their parents worked long hours. Isolated culturally and economically, some of the young Vietnamese arrivals banded together, tapping into the drug trade and preying on the members of their own community.

Tony Hoang, 35, a pastor who spent his teenage years dealing heroin as part of a gang, recalled the time as marked with instability, anger and a need to belong. “It was attractive to be a part of a group that loved each other,” he said.

The violence took a shocking turn in 1994 with the assassination of John Newman, who represented Cabramatta in the State Parliament. A rival local politician who had immigrated from Vietnam was later convicted of the crime.

It was Australia’s first political assassination, and one that would further feed notions of a wave of ethnic migrant violence in Cabramatta.

Frustration over the area’s lawless reputation eventually prompted a parliamentary inquiry. The 2001 report led to the creation of drug treatment and intervention programs and the hiring of more police officers with wider powers to tackle drug crimes. Today, crime levels compare with those in other parts of metropolitan Sydney.

Not all of Cabramatta’s problems have been solved. Housing prices, like elsewhere in Sydney, have risen into the millions of dollars.

And a new wave of migrants, including refugees from Syria and the Middle East, are raising the same kinds of tensions that confronted Vietnamese migrants in the 1970s.

According to the 2016 census, Vietnamese is still the predominant ethnic group in Cabramatta, making up 33 percent of its roughly 22,000 residents. Chinese make up 24 percent, and Cambodians account for 8 percent. At least 40 other ethnic groups are also represented.

Frank Carbone, the mayor of Fairfield City, the western Sydney district surrounding Cabramatta, said that while 7,000 new refugees had been resettled in the region since January 2016, the federal government had not provided any financial support.

Today, though, the children of the initial wave of Vietnamese migrants are seeing a return on their parents’ persistence and creating their own legacy.

On a quieter stretch of John Street, patrons lined up outside Pho Tau Bay, a popular restaurant. Inside, Chi Giang, 36, a placid man in glasses, worked the register as waiters ferried bowls of steaming broth.

Born in an Indonesian refugee camp to Vietnamese parents waiting for Australian visas, Mr. Giang manages the restaurant, which his mother began in the kitchen of their home in 1980. Her closely guarded beef noodle soup recipe often tops critics’ lists of the best Vietnamese food in Sydney, and the profits from the restaurant are enough to sustain Mr. Giang’s entire extended family.

“Over the years, I’ve seen kids coming in as babies,” Mr. Giang said, gesturing to a young family at a nearby table. “And then years later, they’re taller than me, and they’re still coming for beef noodle soup.”",How a Sydney ‘War Zone’ Became a Center of Vietnamese Resolve,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/australia/cabramatta-crime-vietnamese.html

The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is investigating Russian interference in last year’s presidential election and whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Justice Department’s inquiry. He has denied any obstruction.

Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Talley in September to the Federal District Court based in Montgomery, Ala. Weeks later, Mr. Mueller’s investigators notified the White House that they wanted to interview Ms. Donaldson, but there is no indication that anyone anticipated that at the time of her husband’s nomination.

Perhaps best known now as the deposed creator of “Smash,” Ms. Rebeck has long made her way through the man’s world of both theater and television.

Janice recognizes the structural flaws in the office culture, but like a lot of people who find themselves the sole representative of a demographic group, she opts not to dwell on them. She gets along by not threatening the men — keeping her expectations low, her comments flattering and her work mediocre. Also, she dresses like a librarian. (The costumes, which don’t always nail the era, are by Tilly Grimes.)

Eliza hopes that Janice will be an ally. Janice, halfheartedly gaslighting her, hopes that Eliza will tone it down. She doesn’t, and that’s the fun of Ms. Rebeck’s revenge fantasy, which lets no one off the hook for their bad behavior.

The cast is an impressive assemblage of talent, and Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Helgenberger both do fine. Oddly, though, the flashiest roles belong to men: the showboating worm Weber and, especially, the toxic Stu — hardly the only villain here, but the one with the most power, and he relishes abusing it.

Playing Stu is a tricky challenge that Mr. Young expertly meets, giving a comic performance with just enough bite that we can’t dismiss Stu as a buffoon. His body language — the way he cringes in not-so-mock fear when he talks about Eliza — is like a cry straight from his psyche.

But Ben (Jim Parrack), a project leader at the firm, is more insidiously harmful. A casual sexist, he’s also a pragmatist, and good work is his principal concern. He knows Eliza could help with that, but he’s not the kind of guy to make waves. Instead he goes along.

LOS ANGELES — Score two for old-fashioned star power.

A pair of new wide-release movies, “Daddy’s Home 2” and “Murder on the Orient Express,” both of which rely on starry ensembles, arrived to stronger-than-expected ticket sales in North American theaters over the weekend. Although neither could topple “Thor: Ragnarok,” which remained No. 1 for a second week, the sturdy results for “Daddy’s Home 2” and “Murder on the Orient Express” gave Hollywood hope that its formulas may not be as broken as many had started to believe.

“Thor: Ragnarok” (Walt Disney Studios) collected an estimated $56.6 million, for a two-week domestic total of $211.6 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Disney said the Marvel-branded superhero movie has now taken in $650.1 million worldwide.

Second place went to “Daddy’s Home 2,” which took in about $30 million, or roughly 20 percent more than analysts had expected before release. On the downside, the PG-13 comedy was expensive, costing about $70 million to produce. “Daddy’s Home 2,” starring Mark Wahlberg, Mel Gibson, Will Ferrell and John Lithgow, received poor reviews but clicked with audiences, who gave it an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. More than 50 percent of the audience was over age 35.

Even so, it will take much more than one box office win to stabilize Paramount, which has suffered a string of misfires, including “Suburbicon,” “Mother!,” “Monster Trucks” and “Baywatch.” Last week, the studio, which ranks last among Hollywood’s major studios in domestic market share, parted ways with its marketing and distribution chief.

Ever since I started as an editor at The New York Times Magazine a little more than three years ago, one of my main guiding principles has been: Don’t go too far out on a limb. That precept feels particularly important to me because many of the stories I oversee are about science and technology, two subjects where it can be easy for journalists to get too far ahead of the facts. A new study might suggest some scientific breakthrough is on the horizon, but The Times should never cover it in a way that seems to imply it’s already here. In my previous job, at Wired magazine, my colleagues and I had one example of hyperactive prognostication that we used as a running joke: “commuting in dirigibles.” That absurd mental image was a stand-in for all the other ridiculous sci-fi fantasies that, cool as they may look on a magazine cover, have basically no chance of arriving.

In the Tech and Design issue, out this week, my colleagues and I have made an exception to my rule.

Indeed, we’ve gone so far out on a limb — veering into pure speculation — that the branch has surely broken. That’s because the subject of our issue, self-driving cars, is a science-fictional technology that has taken tremendous strides over the past few years, with billions of dollars being invested every year by some of the world’s biggest companies, toward becoming a reality. This looming transformation of the car, itself the most transformative invention in American history, is still quite a few years off, and it still very well might stall or reverse entirely. But if it does arrive, and human drivers go the way of the carriage horse, the implications of that shift would be profound. With that in mind, we thought a little speculation might be called for.

This week’s edition is one of 15 special issues that the magazine will put out this year. Some of these issues let us give broad attention to important subjects — education, say, or business — that we otherwise might not cover enough. But in many cases, we’ve found it especially fun (for us and also, we hope, for readers) to use them to go deep on one story or theme, turning it around and seeing it from every angle.

For the Tech and Design issue, we zeroed in on the autonomous car — and the future it might usher in. Two of our favorite business writers, Kevin Roose and Jon Gertner, visited Ford and Tesla to take the measure of their self-driving projects — and ride around in the autonomous cars they’re making. Kim Tingley visited a start-up that’s teaching large trucks to coordinate on highways in order to save on fuel.

But the real limb-breaking happens in the two essay packages that consume much of the magazine. In twenty short provocations, we’ve asked writers to imagine transformations the world could undergo if humans are no longer driving themselves around. The Times business reporter Nathaniel Popper thinks through the question of how car insurance would change. Gretchen Reynolds, our Well columnist, sketched out an autonomous-car workout. Other writers forecast the effects of autonomous cars on everything from drug dealing to sex to roadkill. Definitely don’t miss the back page, where the illustrator Tomi Um has envisioned what a “Museum of Driving” would be like, in a future where the idea of driving your own car seems as remote as piloting a horse and buggy would today.

Will any of us see a driverless future? It’s hard to say. Right now, the technology works only under very controlled conditions, and something as simple as snow can change the environment around cars in ways that researchers are only beginning to figure out how to account for. But the strides have been so great, and the investment in the technology so vast. Certainly you’re more likely to commute some day in a self-driving car than you are in a dirigible.",The New York Times Takes a Trip to a Driverless Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/insider/times-magazine-driverless-autonomous-cars-future.html

LOS ANGELES — The show apparently goes on.

On Saturday night, as chauffeured S.U.V.’s carrying the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Steven Spielberg inched through gridlock traffic en route to the Governors Awards, the first major stop on Hollywood’s long march to the Oscars, a question hung in the air: How would attendees handle self-celebration at a time when sexual harassment scandals are engulfing the entertainment industry?

On the presenter list were some of Hollywood’s most outspoken women, including Angelina Jolie, Ava DuVernay and Jessica Chastain. Would the tone be less gleeful than usual? Perhaps the Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne would flow a little less freely?

The outcome was perhaps summed up best by a moment during the cocktail hour, when a waiter arrived with a tray of hors d’oeuvres. “Deviled eggs for everyone!” he cheerfully pronounced.

Indeed, the topic of sexual harassment went unmentioned during the formal ceremony, which lasted more than three hours and covered honorary Oscars for the cinematographer Owen Roizman, the actor Donald Sutherland and three directors — Agnès Varda, Charles Burnett and Alejandro G. Iñárritu. The closest anyone came to the elephant in the room was Ms. Jolie, who introduced Ms. Varda, the filmmaker credited with inspiring the French new wave movement with her 1956 film, “La Pointe Courte.”

“We need to draw strength from artists like Agnès,” Ms. Jolie said from the stage. “Those women who went first, who took that first step, showed the way for all of us.”

To the extent that Mr. Moore is entitled to a defense against expulsion, the Senate could initiate fitness proceedings now, before the election, to ascertain whether the accusations against him are credible; alternately, it could suspend his swearing-in until after the investigative proceedings are concluded. If Mr. Moore chose to ignore them, the Senate could simply conclude that he lacks the character and fitness to serve — as Mr. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, surely knows, failing to contest an adjudicative proceeding results in a default judgment.

The Senate has precedents for this course of action. Most recently, expulsion proceedings have been contemplated against Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, should he be convicted in his current corruption trial. And two former Republican senators, John Ensign of Nevada and Bob Packwood of Oregon, faced the prospect of expulsion for sexual misconduct, leading both of them to resign instead.

Mr. Packwood’s case is especially instructive. He was accused of serial sexual harassment that went on for years, though he was never charged with a crime. Nevertheless, in 1995, Mitch McConnell, then the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, wrote the committee’s report recommending Mr. Packwood’s expulsion for a “habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a senator.” Hours after the report was delivered, Mr. Packwood resigned.

In other words, Mr. McConnell has already concluded that credible allegations of serious sexual misconduct should preclude a person from serving in the Senate. Does he still hold this view and is he willing to act on it?

On principle and precedent, Mr. McConnell’s choice is clear. If the Republican Party is serious about preventing Mr. Moore from becoming a member of an institution that likes to bill itself as the world’s greatest deliberative body (with apologies to Westminster), it could stop the insanity now by simply declaring that, if elected, the party’s Senate caucus will move to immediately expel Roy Moore because he lacks the character and fitness to serve.

The results would be less messy than you might think. Under Alabama law, Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, is supposed to appoint an interim senator and order a special election. But the law doesn’t specify a deadline for that election, which means that the state could just wait until the next regularly scheduled elections, in November 2018. That way, the Republicans, who have a narrow Senate majority, wouldn’t lose a seat, and could avoid casting a blind eye on credible allegations of sexual abuse of a minor.

Obviously, things aren’t that simple in practice; Mr. Moore’s supporters, who include Stephen Bannon and most of the conservative media, would surely fight Mr. McConnell with everything they have, and exact revenge if he succeeds. The question comes down to one of principle. The Republicans have the power to block Mr. Moore from joining them. Will they use it?","Yes, the G.O.P.

I know what you’re thinking — psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces — but I am being literal. When we ponder America’s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies’ independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse.

The battle isn’t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn.

But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn’t about military strategy I wasn’t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people’s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals’ heads and hearts.

The book tells the story of the founding era by following the interwoven stories of six people from the period, from birth to death. They include a Connecticut slave, a Seneca warrior, a British aristocrat and an Albany shoemaker. But it was because of the other two — a Virginia planter and the teenage daughter of a British officer — that I found myself going from subway to bus to ferry around the five boroughs, with old maps in one hand and Google Maps in the other. These two figures of 18th-century America were caught up in the mayhem of New York.

George Washington is everyone’s touchstone for the Revolution, and I made him mine as well. To orient myself alongside the commander of the American Army in New York, I began at “the commons,” now City Hall Park, joining municipal workers on the benches at lunch hour. On July 9, 1776, as British soldiers were gathering on Staten Island and preparing to attack Manhattan, Washington arrayed his troops here and had the newly minted Declaration of Independence read aloud to them. The men were so roused up they charged southward and pulled down the statue of King George at what is now Bowling Green. I hiked down to the same spot and stood there, surrounded by the skyscrapers of the Financial District.

By now, some of my colleagues are veteran chroniclers of such shootings, grimly bumping into one another with gallows humor over the past few years in Las Vegas; Colorado Springs; San Bernardino, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Orlando, Fla.

Perhaps because of the small size of Sutherland Springs, the ungainliness of the media’s rush to cover the latest shooting touched a nerve here. As satellite trucks staked out coveted parking spots and broadcasters from around the world described the town’s horrors in German or Russian or Portuguese, tempers flared.

Some residents in the town simply slammed doors in journalists’ faces, a reaction any of us might have had under such circumstances. Others in the town put a price on their cooperation. Reporters from a wide array of organizations scrambled to interview anyone else they could find.

“Eventually the media pressure began to weigh even on me,” Lauren McGaughy, a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, wrote in an eloquent apology to the people of Sutherland Springs. “I did a few on-the-ground interviews before rejecting the rest. It was too stressful. I expressed my growing disgust with a few other journalists, and many agreed with me.”

Journalists were not the only ones who descended on the town. Sidewalk preachers from San Antonio convened at the Valero gas station opposite the church, bellowing their prayers, if not in front of townspeople then for reporters’ iPhone cameras. Chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team meandered through the town.

Brad Kessler, an aspirant for mayor of San Antonio, dropped in to shake hands around the yellow crime-scene tape that cordoned off the killing field. The Homicide Survivors Support Group of Corpus Christi set up a table with stuffed animals, where reporters quickly conducted interviews with the volunteers.

I grew up in a rural outpost in northern New Mexico about the size of Sutherland Springs. I know how suspicious, and sometimes awed, residents of small towns can be of privileged, big-city visitors. Still, I have a hard time imagining what it’s like for the people here to have so many cameras pointed at them and so many tape recorders thrust their way.

As some of the network television trucks began to pull out of town, I wondered how big a role I myself had played in amplifying the suffering of Sutherland Springs. After all, I, too, had approached residents who wanted nothing to do with reporters. I’d asked Ms. Solis, the factory worker, to talk to me when she could have been tending the shoulder where a bullet had sundered her flesh.

When the country endures one mass shooting after another, why they happen certainly ought to be the main focus of the national conversation. But maybe it’s time we also discuss how they’re covered on the ground.

For now, I’m left wondering what happens next in Sutherland Springs.

Bertha Cardenas-Lomas, 57, the head of the town’s cemetery board, seemed to be in shock as I interviewed her, expressing dismay over all the friends and neighbors she now has to bury. She touched on what it’s like to face a barrage of interview requests when she’s struggling to simply mow the grass on the burial ground.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job.","Take the median lifetime earnings of business majors, the most popular undergraduate degree. The typical graduate earns $2.86 million over a lifetime. When you put business graduates side by side with those who graduated with what are considered low-paying majors, you’ll see that those who are slightly above the median salary in their fields are not that far behind the business grads. For example, an English major in the 60th percentile makes $2.76 million in a lifetime, a major in psychology $2.57 million and a history major $2.64 million.

Myth 2: Women want to have it all.

Women are now the clear majority on college campuses, making up 56 percent of students enrolled this fall. They are also more likely than men to graduate.

But when it comes to selecting a major, what women choose tends to segregate them into lower paying fields, such as education and social services, according to a report that Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce will publish later this year. Just look at some of the highest paying fields and the proportion of women who major in them: business economics (31 percent), chemical engineering (28 percent), computer science (20 percent), electrical engineering (10 percent), mechanical engineering (8 percent).

“Women can’t win even as they dominate at every level of higher education,” said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown center.

Dr. Carnevale wouldn’t speculate as to why women make their choices. But he notes that if the proportion of women in fields where men dominate increased by just 10 percent, the gender pay gap would narrow considerably: from 78 cents paid to women for every dollar men receive to 90 cents for every dollar men receive.

Myth 3: Choice of major matters more than choice of college.

Not so. In seven states — Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington — students can search public databases for early earnings of graduates of institutions within the state. And those databases show that students who graduate from more selective schools tend to make more money. After all, the better the college, the better the professional network opportunities, through alumni, parents of classmates and eventually classmates themselves.

These undergraduates are more able to pursue majors in lower paying fields because their networks help them land good jobs. Arts, humanities and social science majors are more prevalent on elite campuses than at second-tier colleges, where students tend to pick vocational majors like business, education and health. In all, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter do, according to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight of the 78 “most selective schools” in Barron’s rankings, compared with 1,800 “less selective schools.”

“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.

They are also more likely to have two majors than students at second-tier colleges, who tend to be more financially needy and have to work, affording less time to double major.

One tip: Complementary majors with overlapping requirements are easier to juggle, but two unrelated majors probably yield bigger gains in the job market, said Richard N. Pitt, an associate professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University who has studied the rise of the double major. “It increases your breadth of knowledge,” he said.

Myth 4: Liberal arts majors are unemployable.

The liberal arts is a favorite target of politicians, with the latest salvo coming from the governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin. “If you’re studying interpretive dance, God bless you, but there’s not a lot of jobs right now in America looking for people with that as a skill set,” Governor Bevin said in a speech in September.

Interpretive dance may not be in demand, but the competencies that liberal arts majors emphasize — writing, synthesis, problem solving — are sought after by employers. A 2017 study by David J. Deming, an associate professor of education and economics at Harvard, found jobs requiring both the so-called soft skills and thinking skills have seen the largest growth in employment and pay in the last three decades.

One knock on the liberal arts is that it’s difficult to find a first job. But a study by Burning Glass Technologies, a Boston-based company that analyzes job-market trends, concluded that if liberal arts graduates gain proficiency in one of eight technical skills, such as social media or data analysis, their prospects of landing entry-level jobs increase substantially.

The long-held belief by parents and students that liberal arts graduates are unemployable ignores the reality of the modern economy, where jobs require a mix of skills not easily packaged in a college major, said George Anders, author of “You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a ‘Useless’ Liberal Arts Education.” In his book, Mr. Anders profiles graduates with degrees in philosophy, sociology and linguistics in jobs as diverse as sales, finance and market research.

“Once C.E.O.s see liberal arts graduates in action,” Mr. Anders said, “they come aboard to the idea that they need more of them.”

Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.

Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?

Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the University of California, Los Angeles.

Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Lehman College in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.

“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, Georgia State’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.

Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.

“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.

Myth 6: You need a major.

A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology.

“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.

“Majors result from the academic structure of the university, tied to the classic academic disciplines. There is no reason they need to be boxed up like that. They don’t take into account emerging fields that cross disciplines.”

Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of Temple, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.

“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”",Six Myths About Choosing a College Major,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/choosing-a-college-major.html

“It is the board’s unanimous belief that Broadcom’s proposal significantly undervalues Qualcomm relative to the company’s leadership position in mobile technology and our future growth prospects.”

The expected move means that Broadcom will have to convince shareholders of its target to change management’s mind — or run a proxy fight that replaces at least some of Qualcomm’s directors. The deadline to nominate directors is next month.

From The Times’s Tiffany Hsu:

Broadcom “could also try to assuage Qualcomm’s fears of government pushback by initiating the regulatory approval process for a potential deal. The company garnered praise from President Trump this month when it said it would move its corporate address to Delaware from Singapore.”

Shares in Qualcomm ended the day up 3 percent, at $66.49. That’s still below Broadcom’s bid of $70 a share, suggesting that investors remain unsure of whether Broadcom’s takeover efforts will succeed.

Missouri’s attorney general subpoenas Google.

Attorney General Josh Hawley of Missouri said he wanted to know if Google had violated state law on matters ranging from how it obtains user data to the possibility that it has manipulated search results to harm competitors.

Here’s what Mr. Hawley had to say in his office’s announcement of an investigative subpoena examining Google’s business practices:

“There is strong reason to believe that Google has not been acting with the best interest of Missourians in mind. My office will not stand by and let private consumer information be jeopardized by industry giants, especially to pad their profits.”

“We have not yet received the subpoena, however, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment.”

Brookfield offers $14.8 billion for the rest of GGP.

Get ready for a potential battle to control one of America’s biggest mall operators.

Brookfield Property Partners, a real estate investment firm, confirmed on Monday that it had offered to buy the 34 percent of GGP that it doesn’t already own. That would make Brookfield one of the biggest publicly traded real estate companies in the world, with nearly $100 billion worth of assets.

GGP, formerly known as General Growth Properties, operates primarily upscale malls like Tysons Galleria in Virginia and Woodbridge Center in New Jersey. Along with other mall operators, it has been grappling with the decline in brick-and-mortar shopping, and has been trying to find new ways to repurpose its real estate.

Brookfield’s C.E.O., Brian Kingston, said this in a statement:

“We are excited about the opportunity to leverage our expertise to grow, transform or reposition GGP’s shopping centers, creating long-term value in a way that would not otherwise be possible.”

Brookfield first gained a stake in GGP when it helped the mall operator emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In its own statement, GGP said that it was considering Brookfield’s bid.

What happens when 3G can’t do more deals?

That’s the question confronting the acquisitive investment firm — long celebrated for its deal-making savvy, Unilever excepted — and its portfolio companies as they run out of transformational acquisition targets. In fact, it raises concern about what all companies whose growth has come in large part from buying others can do when they run out of companies to buy.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kraft Heinz and Restaurant Brands International are all becoming too big to buy huge competitors. And they have largely implemented 3G’s favorite tactics, like zero-based budgeting, to trim costs.

Now they, and their financial backer, must prove that they can grow their businesses organically. Hence, why Anheuser-Busch is replacing the head of its United States subsidiary.

From Jennifer Maloney of the WSJ:

The management changes mark a new phase for the company’s U.S. operations, said Carlos Brito, chief executive of the Belgium-based behemoth. The first phase, after InBev’s 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch, was aimed at cutting costs and paying off debt. The second focused on expanding the portfolio with craft beers and growing higher-end brands such as Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra, Mr. Brito said.

Putting G.E.’s self-help plan in context.

Here are some numbers to keep in mind about G.E.’s latest transformation. You can read the full plan here, and you can read the news release about the dividend here.

• 2009. That’s the last time G.E. cut its dividend.

• $4 billion. That’s how much money the move is expected to save each year.

• 3. That’s how many businesses G.E. now plans to focus on: aviation, power and health care.

• 35 percent. That’s how much G.E. shares have fallen so far this year.

Shares in the conglomerate closed down about 7.2 percent Monday, to $19.02.

At Breakingviews, Rob Cox found some promising, if belated, elements in the turnaround plan presented by John Flannery, G.E.’s new chief:

“Perhaps the most encouraging development to be found in Mr. Flannery’s 57-page slide show on Monday is a plan to put just 12 directors up for a vote next year, including three new ones. That means it is parting company with half the current lineup.”

Has the dysfunction at Uber finally ended?

After all, Uber, its investors and SoftBank’s Masa Son have struck enough compromises to move forward with a long-awaited deal that would allow early shareholders to cash out of the ride-hailing colossus. Those concessions included:

• Giving up special voting rights held by early shareholders like the investment firm Benchmark

• Benchmark suspending its lawsuit against Travis Kalanick

• Mr. Kalanick letting Uber’s other directors have a say over the board seats he controls if he ever needs to fill them again

From Greg Bensinger, WSJ:

“It’s a pretty great reset for the company,” said Bradley Tusk, a political strategist and investor in Uber. “Everyone staying in is focused on the possibilities of the future and everyone mired in the past and present can move on.”

What’s next: SoftBank and its partners can proceed with an offer to buy at least 14 percent of Uber’s shares — although they can walk away if they don’t hit that target. (We want to know whether SoftBank can raise its bid and extend the tender if, toward the end of the process, the Japanese conglomerate still looks like it will fall short of its goal.)

The latest front in the tax battle: private equity.

The newest version of the House bill may have done little to meaningfully affect carried interest, but buyout firms are planning to fight back against limits on the deductibility of corporate debt payments. That would make the core business of private equity — buying and selling companies, in deals financed to some degree with borrowed money — much more difficult.

From Madison Marriage, Javier Espinoza and Sam Fleming in the FT:

“There is no particular logic to the reforms. This is really frightening,” said one London-based private equity manager with international holdings, including in the U.S.

Where we now stand: The House is set to vote on its tax plan by the end of the week. Lawmakers in the House and the Senate are scrambling to counter economic models showing that both proposals would ultimately add to the national debt, according to the NYT.

Don’t cut our taxes: More than 400 millionaires and billionaires, from George Soros to the founders of Ben & Jerry, are sending a letter to Congress this week opposing the Republican plans. “This makes no sense,” Bob Crandall, a former American Airlines C.E.O. and a signatory of the letter, told the WaPo.

Some Republican lawmakers have conceded that — contrary to statements by President Trump and party leaders — not all Americans will see their taxes lowered, and some will see their obligations rise, according to the WaPo.

Some good news for bankers.

Item #1, from Ryan Tracy and Christina Rexrode, WSJ:

The Trump administration has a strong message for the country’s bankers: You’re not the villain anymore. President Trump’s newly minted financial regulatory team — growing in size with recent confirmations — is sounding a friendlier tone than its predecessor, which restricted the industry following the 2008 bank bailouts.

Roy Moore presents a dilemma for the G.O.P.

Now that Alabama’s governor has ruled out delaying the Dec. 12 special election, Mr. Moore appears to be locked in as the Republican nominee for the Senate there. Should he lose — not a given — Republicans would have just a one-seat majority in the Senate, imperiling their ability to move legislation. Senate Republicans have largely abandoned Mr. Moore, although the White House hasn’t at this point.

At the same time, a stream of accusations has hit statehouses from California to Florida, according to the NYT.

A serious breach opens between N.F.L. owners.

As owners debate how to speed contract negotiations with Roger Goodell, while Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys threatens to sue if that happens, we have to ask: Can the league find unity again?

There are many issues to contend with, including player protests, declining TV ratings, and the debate about concussions. The fissure between Mr. Jones and the other owners could prevent the league from coming together on efforts to address all those. “This is not the way we do things in the N.F.L.,” Arthur Blank of the Falcons told Mr. Jones on a call last week, according to Sports Illustrated.

What N.F.L. owners will discuss today: Mr. Goodell’s most recent proposal, which includes annual compensation of $49.5 million, the lifetime use of a private jet and lifetime health insurance for his family, according to ESPN, citing an unidentified person.

The best news for Democrats is that they don’t turn off many suburban and urban voters by focusing on class.","Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor-elect, didn’t only lose outside of the big metropolitan areas, and badly. He lost by more than the previous Democratic nominee, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, had in 2013. Of Virginia’s 133 counties and cities, Northam fared worse than McAuliffe in 89 of them.

True, Northam did better than Clinton had, but only modestly so, as The Times’s Nate Cohn noted. That’s another way of saying that Trump’s success with the white working class now looks almost like the norm.

Patrick Ruffini, a savvy conservative pollster, made a similar point when analyzing Virginia’s House of Delegates results. On first glance, those results look fantastic for Democrats. They flipped 15 of the 100 delegate districts, including a few inspiring long-shot wins. Yet only a single one of those 15 districts had voted for Trump. Republicans largely held the Trump districts, which let them keep control (pending recounts), 51 delegates to 49.

I know that many progressives are tired of hearing about the white working class. They would rather stop obsessing over small-town America and instead pursue a coalition of minorities and highly educated whites, like the coalition that won Virginia last week.

But giving up on the white working class would be a terrible mistake. Whites without four-year college degrees make up fully half of the adult population, and they tend to be dispersed, rather than packed in small geographic areas, which increases their political power.

Accepting landslide defeats among the white working class effectively forfeits many state legislatures — like those in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, all of which are now Republican. State legislatures don’t just make policy. They are also in charge of gerrymandering.

Without the white working class, Democrats will need everything else to go spectacularly well to retake the House of Representatives next year. Virginia itself has four Republican-held seats that analysts think will be in play. Northam won only two of those four districts, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

Or consider the Democrats’ four special-election House losses earlier this year, including the high-profile Georgia race. All were in Trump-won districts that Democrats couldn’t quite flip.

How can the party can do better? It’s not an easy problem, and I wouldn’t trust anyone who claims otherwise. But the crux of the matter is clear enough: Democrats have to get the white working class to focus on the working-class part of their identity rather than the white part.

Most voters don’t make decisions by doing a cost-benefit analysis of candidates’ proposals. They instead tend to vote for candidates who instinctively seem to get their lives. Voters are attracted to candidates with whom they can identify.

Trumpism focuses people on the white part of identity. The Virginia campaign, for example, revolved around talk of immigrants and old Confederate heroes. When those are the topics, Democrats are going to struggle (however frustrating that may be).

But race isn’t the only part of people’s identities. When voters instead focus on class, Democrats thrive. Think back to Barack Obama’s populist-tinged 2012 re-election campaign. Or look at the senators, like Sherrod Brown and Claire McCaskill, who hold their own outside of metropolitan areas. Or the landslide victories for ballot initiatives on Medicaid and the minimum wage.

The best news for Democrats is that they don’t turn off many suburban and urban voters by focusing on class. Most of them are struggling with slow-growing wages, too.

Again, no one should pretend that finding the perfect message is easy. And no one should pretend that the Democrats have already found it.","Democrats, Don’t Be Fooled by Victory",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/opinion/democrats-virginia-jersey-victory.html

Is it harder now to put together a comedy event intended for a wide audience? Is it possible to be a comedian without a political point of view?

STEWART [old man voice] “It was a simpler time. A movie was a nickel. A sandwich, they paid you to eat.” Now everything is conflict. Everything exists now for clicks. You’re incentivized to pick not just the lowest-hanging fruit but the fruit that tastes the worst. Because what you want is a reaction, whether it be incredibly positive or incredibly negative. You can’t avoid that that is the world in which this is born, or even a world that we helped create.

Do you think you contributed to that environment? Do you feel responsible for ——

STEWART For the sad state of the world? I do, but not for that reason. I just assume I’m always doing something wrong. Some of it is that the news cycle is so relentless and ubiquitous. Comedy shows that are promoting more day-and-date stuff have to keep up with that.



SMIGEL Since Jon started, comedy has had to deal with the instant reaction it gets on the web. What frustrates me is seeing comedy succumbing to that. A lot of times, jokes now are judged on the target — on the point of view, rather than how funny they are.

Has the internet made people quicker to take offense at jokes?

STEWART I don’t think they’re quicker to offense. I think it’s quicker that you know about it. The outrage has always been there — it just wasn’t on your feed.

SMIGEL I did these Triumph specials last year, and by the time the election ended I was just like, “Enough.” I was so disgusted by both sides. I was supporting Hillary, but all she would talk about in emails I would get is that Trump is a misogynist. No policy stuff. Just that urge to be divisive and to call the other side names, I was happy to sit it out.

SMIGEL It fit right in with Larry’s way of making light of a serious situation. He was the butt of the joke. It seemed like a joke that a lot of old Jews would laugh at.

STEWART I did laugh at it. I am an old Jew.

SMIGEL On the web, a lot of people were defending it. I thought, O.K., this is good. People are saying, you can draw a line here, at what you can be outraged by.

What about when the outrage over a misbegotten joke — like what happened with Kathy Griffin — ends up ostracizing a performer?

STEWART In certain moments it leaves a mark. You see that it does leave permanent scars in its wake, in very rare instances. But there was that PR person, Justine Sacco, who had tweeted out a bad joke about AIDS and traveling to South Africa. By the time she got off the plane, her life was over. And she was just a civilian in the culture war, to a large extent.

SMIGEL You forget that this person who might have made a mistake on Twitter was maybe not 100 percent evil and worthy of losing everything.

STEWART I think that I contributed to that culture. I took a long, hard look at that idea of unfairness and context. I felt like we [“The Daily Show”] worked really hard to maintain that credibility. But there’s no question that it influenced and partook sometimes in a dehumanizing process. No question. Even with situations like Anthony Weiner. When the pile-on occurs, that person turns into a two-dimensional Flat Stanley, as everybody pounds on them. And then that person ends up, actually, turning out to be horrible and has to go to jail. [laughter]

Knowing this capacity for outrage exists, are you more wary, as comedians, about what you say in your performances?

STEWART We’re not victims of this culture, by any stretch of the imagination, and those comments are the price of doing business in the cultural sphere.

SMIGEL What bothers me is that temptation to fuel your side’s fire; it’s on both sides, more than ever. I don’t want to be part of that problem. There was a point where I was like, O.K., this guy’s been elected. Now if I keep relentlessly hitting him with my puppet, am I really being helpful? Or am I just profiting?

For people who don’t share your politics and feel alienated by what they see in TV comedy — who wish we could go back to a more evenhanded era of Johnny Carson — do they have a point?

STEWART Here’s what I would say: Tough shit. Honestly. The idea that you’ve lost the pleasure of watching Carson? We all have lost that pleasure. I used to like watching Carson, too. But I think that’s a cop-out. The people that say, “This culture isn’t for me,” live in a nostalgic world. Those are the people that are the first to tell minorities, “Suck it up.” Those are the first people to say to individuals that are being relentlessly either ostracized or legally threatened, “Oh, snowflake, watch yourself.” But God forbid somebody doesn’t say “Merry Christmas.” It’s the empty rhetoric of grievance, and I don’t feel bad in any way, whatsoever.

SMIGEL Colbert, especially, is hilarious, night in and night out. Sarah [Silverman]’s trying really hard.

Rostec has received government approval to sell a 26 percent stake in Kalashnikov, Sergei V. Chemezov, the holding company’s director, said on Monday in Dubai, where he was attending an air show.

Rostec first floated the idea of the privatization in February, but it had not received an endorsement from the government until now. At the time, Kalashnikov said in a press release that Mr. Krivoruchko, a Russian industrialist, would be a buyer. Mr. Krivoruchko’s other investments include shares in suburban commuter trains in Moscow.

“We have just finalized the decision to sell a stake of 26 percent minus one share,” Mr. Chemezov said, in comments carried by Zvezda, a Russian military news site. His comments did not specify the buyer.

Mr. Bokarev and Mr. Makhmudov announced on Friday that they would sell their stakes to Mr. Krivoruchko, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday.

Together, the two sales will give Mr. Krivoruchko control of Kalashnikov, with about a 75 percent stake in the company.

Rostec executives say Kalashnikov is profitable and ready for privatization. Last year, the gun maker reported sales of 18.3 billion rubles, or $308 million at current exchange rates, and profit of 3 billion rubles, or $51 million.

Until the crisis in Ukraine prompted the imposition of American sanctions, Kalashnikov had done a brisk business selling civilian rifles in the United States under the Baikal and Saiga brands. The United States is the world’s largest civilian firearms market, and Kalashnikov was selling more rifles to the country’s civilian market than to the Russian military before the sanctions were imposed.

The company has since tried to sell guns elsewhere to compensate for the lost business. Last month, Kalashnikov signed a licensing agreement to produce one variant of the rifle, the AK-103, in Saudi Arabia. It has also encouraged wider civilian gun ownership in Russia. After the American sanctions took effect, the company created a new logo, a line of branded clothing and advertising targeting Russian buyers.","Kalashnikov, AK-47 Maker, Goes Private as Russian Government Sheds Stake",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/dealbook/kalashnikov-ak47-sale.html

“One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.","A serpentine river gently cuts through a mountain plateau. Shepherds tend their flock while young men hunt wild game, fish along ancient tributaries or kayak over rapids. This pleated landscape of rolling hills and jagged mountains is most verdant in spring, when the junipers are full, the grass a vibrant emerald.

These quiet moments and images are not often associated with Iraq. But the Kurdish region, in the country’s northern reaches, is home to such reprieves. Beyond the oil fields of Taqtaq and Kirkuk, far east of Mosul and many miles north of Baghdad, the semiautonomous region often feels timeless and progressive, restive and at peace.

What the Vietnamese photographer Lam Duc-Hien first imagined of Iraq before traveling there on assignment were the usual media tropes from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq — tanks and violence, surges and refugees. Mr. Lam, who was working for nongovernment organizations and a French newspaper, said he had never heard of the Kurdish people, who by then were fleeing Saddam’s oppressive and violent Baath Party. But after he settled down in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, a region he documented for more than two decades, he found the country to be vastly different than what he had expected.

“I just discovered, and was completely amazed by, the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said by phone from the Kurdish capital of Erbil, where he is based.

Photo

Over the years he has lived and worked there, he often traveled with the peshmerga, the Kurdish military, while on duty and off. “When I spend time with them, we always go to the mountains,” he said. “For me, it is like coming back to the 19th-century, because we are fishing with Kalashnikovs. For me, it’s incredible.”

Often referred to as a people without a country, the Kurds have for many years sought refuge in the mountains that abut Turkey and Iran. “I focused specifically on different ethnic groups and different religions in Kurdistan,” he said. “It’s small place, but it is very diverse.”

The robust culture of daily Kurdish life is captured in Mr. Lam’s photographs, a collection that stretches from the 1990s through to the war against the Islamic State. The selection is “based on this long relationship with the Kurdish people,” Mr. Lam said. “I spend more time with them than taking pictures of them.”

A child leans in for a kiss from his little companion beneath a tree in the village of Badawan; a group of women in traditional Kurdish dresses dance atop a mountain plateau; families gather on the first day of Eid al-Adha to break the Ramadan feast at the grave of a loved one. “Each time I get back here,” Mr. Lam said, “I feel like I have a link with the people.”

Photo

Though Mr. Lam’s images sometimes show refugees and internally-displaced persons living in camps within the Kurdish region, he often shied away from the violence that has wracked the region and nearly divided the country, choosing instead to focus on the vitality of the people, not their blemishes.

Mr. Lam sympathized with the Kurdish dream of separating from Iraq. He has heard whispers of secession since 1991. “One day, we would like to have our own country,” Mr. Lam recalled his friends telling him many years ago.

But that dream has become a nightmare for many following an independence referendum in September. Disputed areas controlled by Kurdish forces were reclaimed by the Iraqi army. Flights were suspended to and from the region. A number of Kurds have since been killed or maimed in clashes with federal forces.

Photo

The recent infighting reminded Mr. Lam of a time when, during travels in the areas outside the Kurdish region, he lost that sense of fellowship — and safety — he had felt among the Kurdish people. After two bombs exploded in Baghdad’s Sadr City in 2013, with corpses littering the streets as he worked, Mr. Lam reluctantly fled the country.

“When you get involved with the Kurdish soul or friendship,” Mr. Lam said, “it’s very difficult to get out.”

He returned to Erbil soon after.

LONDON — What are the first things that spring to mind when you think of the north of England? The Beatles, cobbled streets and Manchester United? 1990s rave culture, rain and feisty women with fake eyelashes and bouffant hair? The part of the country that last year voted solidly for Britain to leave the European Union?

Few geographical areas have had the same outsize impact on popular culture and artistic imaginations as this small region, framed by Scotland, Wales, the North Sea and a hotly contested southern border. And that is made clear in a new exhibition, “North: Fashioning Identity,” which opened Nov. 8 at Somerset House.

The show explores representations and stereotypes of the North (as it is known in Britain) — and Northerners — through more than 100 photographs, garments, films and works of art. They range from pieces by the fashion designer Paul Smith and the photographer Alasdair McLellan, both of whom were born in the region, to designs by those who simply could not shake its influence.

Photo

“The North feels very familiar to people who have never actually visited it; they can connect to certain visual codes or motifs, or the individuals or songs from the region that contributed to the formative experiences of their youth,” said Lou Stoppard, the co-curator of the exhibition. She referred to parkas by the Belgian-born Raf Simons that feature prints by Peter Saville, the art director of the independent Factory Records company in Manchester (he also designed album covers and posters for Northern bands like Joy Division and New Order). And designs by Virgil Abloh, the founder and creative director of Off-White, were inspired by the Manchester megaclub Hacienda.

“Raf came from small-town Belgium and Virgil from the outskirts of Chicago, so both know what it feels to live outside cultural epicenters like London or New York when you are young,” Ms. Stoppard said. “For those who come from Northern England, or anywhere else in that vein, there is a shared sense that in order to be noticed, you have to work that much harder, be that much tougher. Much of what fuels the North-South divide in this country comes from the nonchalance and entitlement of London.”

Photo

The show, which first opened in February at the Open Eye gallery in Liverpool, was initially inspired by a resurgence of media interest in work that explicitly referenced Northern England and the realities of life in the mid-2000s, alongside the rise of Northern-born models like Agyness Deyn. But, said Adam Murray, a lecturer at the Manchester School of Art and Central St. Martins, who curated the exhibition with Ms. Stoppard, events like Britain’s decision to leave the E.U. have prompted fresh contemplation of what the North means to the country.",Why Fashion Can’t Stop Looking North,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/fashion/exhibition-london-somerset-house.html

The previous guidelines defined high blood pressure as 140/90. (The first number describes the pressure on blood vessels when the heart contracts, and the second refers to the pressure as the heart relaxes between beats.)

Even under that relatively more lenient standard, close to half of patients did not meet blood pressure goals, said Dr. Eric Peterson, a professor of medicine at Duke University.

“A lot of it is inertia,” he said. “We accept higher blood pressures way more than we should.”

But few risk factors are as important to health. High blood pressure is second only to smoking as a preventable cause of heart attacks and strokes, and heart disease remains the leading killer of Americans.

“If the guidelines are implemented, they will have a big impact,” said Dr. David Goff, director of the division of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

The guidelines suggest starting drug treatment with the aim of getting blood pressure below 130/80 for anyone with at least a 10 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next decade. Simply being age 65 or older qualifies as such a risk if their blood pressure is higher than the new standard.

Younger patients at risk include those with conditions like established heart disease or diabetes. The new standard will apply to them, as well.

People whose risk of heart attack or stroke is less than 10 percent will be told to aim for blood pressure below 140/90, and to take medications if necessary to do so.

If there is any good news for patients here, it is that nearly all the drugs used to treat high blood pressure are generic now. Many cost pennies a day, and most people can take them without incident.","Under New Guidelines, Millions of Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/blood-pressure-treatment-guidelines.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
