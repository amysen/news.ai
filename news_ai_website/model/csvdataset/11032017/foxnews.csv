Who’s afraid of the Clintons? Not Donna Brazile.

The explosive book by the former head of the Democratic National Committee is rocking the political world with its tales of Hillary Clinton’s brazen corruption and tawdry deceits. To add extra punch to her insider’s account, Brazile is telling interviewers that Clinton’s 2016 campaign was “sterile” and a “cult,” and mocking it as sexless and joyless.

She even writes that she considered trying to replace Clinton as the nominee over health concerns after the candidate collapsed at the 9/11 anniversary ceremony, a fact that demolishes the myth that suspicions about Clinton’s condition were the sole province of conservative partisans.

To say the Clinton camp is furious at what they regard as betrayal doesn’t do justice to their outrage. They are attacking Brazile personally, accusing her of telling outright lies just to sell books.

Handler recently announced that she was giving up her Netflix series to focus on political activism, but many industry insiders suspect her show wasn’t going to be around for much longer either way. She recently mistakenly referred to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher as a woman and received backlash after quickly blaming the GOP for a deadly mass shooting. This time, Handler thought she had a clever tweet about President Trump but it backfired when Broaddrick caught wind of it.

Handler tweeted, “Imagine being molested by an older man. Then that man denies ever doing it and then goes on and gets elected to United States senate. What kind of message does that send to young girls everywhere? And men to all the men who abuse women?”

Broaddrick, who is one of many women who have accused former President Clinton of sexual misconduct, noticed the former comedian’s tweet and quickly responded.

“I can imagine. I was raped by the Arkansas AG who then becomes Governor & President and NBC held my interview explaining the rape until after his impeachment hearing. But I'm sure you don't want to go there,” Broaddrick fired back.

Broaddrick has said that Clinton raped her in April 1978 and that Hillary Clinton intimidated her in an effort to keep her silent about the situation. She finally gave an interview to NBC in 1999 but the network didn’t air it until Clinton’s impeachment process ended with an acquittal.

Last year, Michael Isikoff, the legendary investigative reporter who uncovered the Monica Lewinsky scandal only to have it spiked by Newsweek, called on NBC to release the full tape of its 1999 interview with Broaddrick – who has accused the network of editing out a portion of her interview in which she discussed Hillary Clinton’s role silencing her and other victims.

Broaddrick and two other Clinton accusers, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones, participated in a press conference with then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign to discuss their past allegations of sexual impropriety against Clinton when Trump was running against Hillary.

Clinton denied Broaddrick's allegation through a lawyer back in the '90s, but that hasn’t stopped Broaddrick from trying to hold both Clintons accountable.

In making the announcement, Wallace said, “Harris, Dana and Sandra are rising stars and their combined background and expertise across news, business and politics will enable us to provide a more in-depth look at the major stories breaking out of Washington, and around the country. We are living in unprecedented times and this new lineup ensures our viewers will get the best news, information and analysis on the news of the hour across the nation and around the globe.”

Outnumbered Overtime originally debuted as a web show led by Faulkner following the TV version every day and her new program will seek to harness the popularity of that effort.

Faulkner added, “Three years ago, we enhanced cable news with a show that combines news and opinion, predominantly from the female point of view, and immediately, Outnumbered became the number one show in its timeslot. I am proud of the work we’re continuing to do there, and blessed to have this added opportunity to create a new program that will help inform our viewers and keep them engaged in a conversation surrounding the day’s headlines.”

Smith commented, “There’s no one better in the business than Bill Hemmer and I am honored to kick off the network’s news hours with him, informing our viewers of the biggest stories and issues driving the day.”

With her understanding of what makes news, how to respond to it and her unique political expertise, Perino will break it all down with insight from key Beltway experts.

Perino remarked, “Our new show will aim to take on the major issues facing Americans and explore them from all angles. I am excited for this opportunity to draw from my political background to help our viewers get beyond the headlines and better understand what is really going on behind the scenes in Washington each day.”

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has called for Moore to step aside, while others, including Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, have suggested Moore quit the race if the allegations are proven to be true.
Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot.","Embattled Senate hopeful Roy Moore answered demands he step aside in the Alabama election with more defiance Monday, threatening to sue the Washington Post for publishing ""fake news"" and calling for his fellow Republican and chief critic Mitch McConnell to leave his post as Senate majority leader.

“I think he should step aside,” McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky.

McConnell said after the allegations were published last week that Moore should quit the race if the allegations are true. However, he also said Monday in Louisville: “I believe the women.”

This weekend, Moore, who on Dec. 12 will compete in a special general election for the seat, accused the paper of having a “political agenda” and vowed in the coming days to unmask those behind it.

“Why now?” he asked Saturday during an event in Alabama, his first public appearance since the allegations were reported last Thursday. “The Democrats know the importance of this election. They see it as a prelude to the 2018 races. … They are desperate. This is a prime example of fake news.”

The 70-year-old Moore has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct from roughly four decades ago. And he has threatened to bring a lawsuit against the liberal-leaning paper, which has endorsed his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.

The Washington Post reported last week that Moore, who is former chief justice of Alabama’s Supreme Court, allegedly had sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. The woman told the Post that Moore took her to his house, where he took off her clothes and his pants, touched her and moved her hand to touch his underwear. Three other women also told the paper he pursued relationships with them when they were between 16 and 18 years old. The age of consent in Alabama is 16.

McConnell endorsed Luther Strange in the GOP primary for the seat, left open when Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions earlier this year was appointed U.S. attorney general.

Strange has since occupied the seat and was considered by President Trump, McConnell and other Senate leaders as more supportive of their agenda than Moore, a Christian conservative.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has called for Moore to step aside, while others, including Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, have suggested Moore quit the race if the allegations are proven to be true.

Still, Moore appears to be holding on to at least some of the support he had among Alabama voters, in his victory over Strange.

He also continues to get strong support from Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House political strategist, who recently returned to influential conservative news outlet Breitbart News.

Bannon said Friday night at an event in South Carolina, after The Post story, about Moore: “I think you’re going to find in the mainstream media, either tonight or tomorrow … some pretty interesting stories about how that information got dropped and who paid for it and who weaponized it.”

Trump deflected questions Saturday, while on a 13-day Asian trip, about whether Moore should stay in the race.

“I have not seen very much about him, about it,"" he told reporters. “I haven’t been able to devote very much time to it.”

The president also referred to a White statement that read the president believes Moore will ""do the right thing and step aside"" if the allegations are true.

McConnell on Monday was also questioned about the possibility of a write-in effort by another GOP candidate.

""That's an option we're looking at ... whether or not there is someone who can mount a write-in campaign successfully,"" he said. Asked specifically about Strange, he said, ""We'll see.""

On the Democratic side, one of the Senate's moderate members is helping Moore's challenger raise campaign funds, underscoring the party's wary approach in an Alabama race that until recently was viewed as a certain win for the GOP.

""Doug's opponent, Roy Moore, is an extremist with a record of putting political ideology above the rule of law,"" Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., wrote in a weekend email soliciting contributions for Jones.

Even if Moore were to step aside, his name would likely remain on the ballot. And any effort to add Strange as a write-in candidate would threaten to divide the GOP vote in a way that would give the Democratic candidate a greater chance of winning.

Congress has some constitutional clout to stop Moore from being seated, if he wins next month, but the chamber has not ousted a member since 1862.

While he has called the allegations ""completely false and misleading,"" in an interview with conservative radio host Sean Hannity, he did not wholly rule out dating teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Asked if that would have been usual for him, Moore said, ""Not generally, no.""

Or are you?

Often, they are looking to remove the outer layers of the claws as new claws grow, also it feels so good to get a stretch on the vertical surface!""

ANTHONY WEINER SCANDALS: FROM POLITICS TO SEXTING CASES

In a Nov. 1 email to students, Pierson College head Stephen Davis wrote that the portraits, which were initially removed to make space for the college's annual Halloween dance, would not immediately be put back up as customary.

""In the context of campus-wide conversations about diversity and inclusion in public art and representation,"" Davis wrote, ""... we've decided to leave the walls empty for the time being, in the hope that the blank walls will begin to prompt conversation on what it means to create common spaces where everyone has a sense of belonging and ownership.""

Davis' email added that the fellows' portraits would be relocated to the college's Fellows Lounge and noted that administrators would be ""working to develop plaques/labels for them ... to mark their historical context and significance.""

In place of the former heads of Pierson College -- a prestigious club that includes journalist John Hersey, composer Quincy Porter and historian Gaddis Smith -- Davis said students would be given an opportunity during a ""study break"" to create portraits of themselves and one another for display in the dining hall. Davis closed the email by encouraging them to ""bring your voices and artistic skills to the table as we continue our efforts to make Pierson College an ever more equitable and welcoming place.""

On Tuesday night, Davis denied in a post on the college's Facebook page that he intended to remove the portraits permanently from the dining hall, and claimed they would have been restored after an unspecified period of time. The college head said his initial email and a Yale Daily News story about the portraits had generated ""misperceptions"" among students, staff and alumni.

Davis wrote his original plan for the portraits had been ""complicated by some painting scheduled for the Fellows Lounge,"" and announced that they would be restored to the dining hall ""alongside the art produced by our community members.""

""With regard to our plans moving forward, I fully expect any proposals we make regarding the diversification of our public spaces to be inclusive of the portraits honoring my predecessors,"" Davis added.

The same day, Yale College Dean Marvin Chun wrote in an email to the Yale Daily News that he believed the portraits of the former college heads should remain visible, ""both for preserving the colleges’ histories and for honoring the intentions of alumni, fellows and friends who generously commissioned these portraits.

""The two goals of reflecting Yale’s community today and honoring its past are not mutually exclusive.""

So, it took quite a bit to get me to boycott the NFL, but they managed it. Until the owners require their players to stand for the national anthem, or sit for the game, I won’t watch a minute, and I’m not alone.

Since Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the anthem in a misguided protest against police violence, the NFL has been hemorrhaging fans. Both TV viewership and attendance at stadiums are well down and once people find other ways to spend their Sundays, they may not come back.

Let there be no doubt, the NFL is a business and the owners of those billion dollar plus franchises have a problem. A bunch of their players want to play social justice games, but their core audience, the folks who pay the bills, just want them to play football. And we really don’t like the disrespect shown to the anthem, the flag and those who fought for our country including those who came home in coffins with that flag draped over them.

This Veterans Day weekend there was quite a duality. The NFL went whole hog saluting the military and trying to mend fences. Historically the league, and most of the players, have been very supportive of the military. Part of that was the tens of millions of tax dollars the military paid them to put on displays with the flag and flyovers for the recruiting value, but there was also a genuine bond for the most part.

But at the same time there was a push to boycott the NFL. I did my part on social media:

Like many others, seeing a bunch of pampered millionaires stealing the moment when we should all come together in thanks for the freedoms we enjoy, and yes for those who safeguard them, well that just flat pisses me off.

They say the protests are not against the anthem or the flag or the military for that matter. But that is garbage because the effect is to disrespect all of those things so they can virtue signal their solidarity with the radical left. They could do their social justice pandering whenever they want, and they made a conscious choice. By choosing to put the spotlight on themselves instead of the symbols of what makes this country great.

That just doesn’t sit well with those of us who served, or have family who did or who just want to enjoy a football game without politics. We get plenty of bitter arguments and displays of partisanship all day every day. Football was a time to forget all that and just remember how much the Bears still suck. They took that and even worse did so with divisive anti-police grievance mongering to a crowd with a heavy component of Blue Lives Matters sentiment.

While only Mills appeared to take pleasure in the awkward image by tweeting it out, it should be noted that The Associated Press, Reuters and AFP published similar photos.
The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The most recent example of high-profile media bias against President Trump comes from New York Times’ top photographer Doug Mills, who apparently snapped an unflattering picture of the president as “revenge.”

Mills was upset when he wasn’t allowed to follow Trump inside the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meetings on Friday, which the White House press pool wasn’t invited to. Mills tweeted an image of a black box with the caption, “This what our APEC Summit photo coverage looks today… blank.”

Mills was apparently still unhappy with the president on Monday at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and took out his frustration by tweeting an unflattering image of a grimacing President Trump that he snapped during the ASEAN leaders' annual “family photo.” The photo that quickly circulated online is an awkward image of Trump reaching across his body to shake the hands of other world leaders. Video shows that Trump quickly made the unflattering face before smiling and looking presidential for the remainder of the photo op.

The anti-Trump media predictably loved the unbecoming image, with CNN’s Chris Cillizza tweeting, “This should be banned,” and NBC’s Frank Thorp admiring the photographer, bragging, that Mills “does it again.”

The Washington Post noticed and published a story headlined, “News photographer who protested White House restrictions on access gets revenge with revealing shot of Trump.” The story noted, “Surely there were many other frames Mills could have chosen that made Trump look more distinguished.”

""Surely there were many other frames Mills could have chosen that made Trump look more distinguished."" - David Nakamura

“Yet Mills and other pool photographers published the awkward ones,” the Post’s David Nakamura wrote. “What Mills's photo does is make a strong case in answer of how this post began — the question of why the access of the independent press matters even on staged photo-ops or seemingly trivial events.”

Nakamura continued: “In ways both subtle and stark, Trump's awkward grimace reveals the messy reality of high-stakes geopolitics that an airbrushed official portrait of the ASEAN ‘family’ would gloss over.”

The Pulitzer Prize-winning Mills has worked as a photographer in the Washington bureau of The New York Times since 2002. He had previously worked at The Associated Press, where he won a variety of awards for coverage of Bill Clinton.

Matt Walker found the smashed Nokia camera in Washington nine years ago, Fox 5 DC reports. He was working on a landscaping job when he saw the camera on the side of the road. The memory card containing the photos was not damaged.

“I’ve never been in the military, but by the photos, I can feel what they were going through and this is why it makes it so important to give it back to him,” Walker told the station.

Walker believes the camera belonged to a Marine whose last name is Zellman.

The Marine is seen in one photo with Iraqi children.

He is seen in others that appear to have been taken at Alasad Airbase in Iraq.

The Marine is also seen in several photos that were taken as he underwent training.

“Loading up on airplanes, C30s, the helicopters,” Walker said. “What it looked like to me was that he was a gunner on top of a Humvee.”

Walker told the station he has had no luck finding Zellman.

“I’ve contacted recruiters, I’ve contacted Marine buddies trying to figure out how to get this back to him. Nothing,” Walker said.

The answer is no.

Not the Congress. Not his secretary of defense. And by design, not the military officers who would be duty-bound to execute the order.

As Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer and expert on nuclear command and control, has put it, ""The protocol for ordering the use of nuclear weapons endows every president with civilization-ending power."" Trump, he wrote in a Washington Post column last summer, ""has unchecked authority to order a preventive nuclear strike against any nation he wants with a single verbal direction to the Pentagon war room.""

Or, as then-Vice President Dick Cheney explained in December 2008, the president ""could launch a kind of devastating attack the world's never seen. He doesn't have to check with anybody. He doesn't have to call the Congress. He doesn't have to check with the courts.""

And the world has changed even more in the decade since, with North Korea posing a bigger and more immediate nuclear threat than had seemed possible. The nature of the U.S. political world has changed, too, and Trump's opponents — even within his own party — question whether he has too much power over nuclear weapons.

These realities will converge Tuesday in a Senate hearing room where the Foreign Relations Committee — headed by one of Trump's strongest Republican critics, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee — will hear testimony from a former commander of the Pentagon's nuclear war fighting command and other witnesses. The topic: ""Authority to order the use of nuclear weapons.""

Corker said numerous lawmakers have raised questions about legislative and presidential war-making authorities and the use of America's nuclear arsenal.

""This discussion is long overdue,"" Corker said in announcing the hearing.

Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science at the Stevens Institute of Technology who has researched and written extensively about presidential nuclear authority, said he hopes the discussion ""might shed some more light on aspects of the procedures for presidential use of nuclear weapons that I think really needs to be known and talked about.""

He said the U.S. system has evolved through tradition and precedent more than by laws.

""The technology of the bomb itself does not compel this sort of arrangement,"" he wrote in an email exchange. ""This is a product of circumstances. I think the circumstances under which the system was created, and the world we now live in, are sufficiently different that we could, and perhaps should, contemplate revision of the system.""

Asked about this Monday in an impromptu exchange at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was reluctant to describe his role in nuclear strike decision-making. ""I'm the president's principal adviser on the use of force,"" he said. Asked whether he was comfortable with the system as it exists, he said, ""I am,"" but did not elaborate.

Some aspects of presidential nuclear war-making powers are secret and therefore not well understood by the public. The system is built for fast decision-making, not debate. That's because speed is seen as essential in a crisis with a nuclear peer like Russia. Unlike North Korea, Russia has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the U.S. in minutes.

Russia's long-range missiles could reach the U.S. in about 30 minutes. Submarine-launched missiles fired from nearer U.S. shores might arrive in half that time. Given that some of the U.S. response time would be taken up by administrative steps, the president would have less than 10 minutes to absorb the information, review his options and make his decision, according to a December 2016 report by nuclear arms specialist Amy Woolf of the Congressional Research Service.

A president who decided to launch a nuclear attack — either in retaliation for a nuclear strike or in anticipation of one — would first hold an emergency conference with the defense secretary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and other advisers. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command, now Air Force Gen. John Hyten, would brief the president on strike options, and the president would make his decision.

The president would communicate his decision and transmit his authorization through a device called the nuclear football, a suitcase carried by a military aide. It's equipped with communication tools and a book with prepared war plans.

If the president decided to order a strike, he would identify himself to military officials at the Pentagon with codes unique to him. These codes are recorded on a card known as the biscuit that is carried by the president at all times. He would then transmit the launch order to the Pentagon and Strategic Command.

Blair, the former missile launch officer, said there is no way to reverse the president's order. And there would be no recalling missiles once launched.

Although fielded and assigned for use by the military, the nuclear bomb is inherently a political weapon, given its almost unimaginable destructive capacity. That explains why the system for controlling the use of U.S. nuclear weapons has been designed to concentrate decision-making power in the ultimate political office: the presidency.",Could anyone stop Trump from launching nukes?

There’s no reason that children need smartphones; if parents are concerned about staying in touch with their children, they can still give them feature phones without internet access.","A few weeks ago on “The Next Revolution” on Fox News Channel, we debated the impact of technology on children. My guest, Dr. Jean Twenge, shared shocking research from her latest book, which has a rather wonderful title: “iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy – and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood.”

According to Twenge – and her research is backed up by numerous other studies – the use of smartphones is changing childhood in fundamental and deeply negative ways.

I wanted to talk to her about this topic because it’s one that I’ve long been interested in – and where I have views that many consider to be somewhat extreme.

In my own book, “More Human – Designing a World Where People Come First,” I looked at the way unsupervised access to the internet is exposing children to dark and dangerous forms of online pornography. This leads to premature sexualization that has a devastating impact on young people’s attitudes to sex and relationships.

I wrote that unsupervised internet access is actually setting back the progress our society has made on gender equality. Early access to online porn is leading boys to think of girls as sexual objects, always available for male gratification.

For these and other reasons, I made the case in “More Human” that we should not allow children to access the internet unsupervised. What does that mean in practice? Just as we ban smoking and drinking for under 16, because we want to shield young people from their harmful effects, we should do the same for smartphones.

Most parents don’t want their kids to have smartphones in the first place. But parents worry about the social stigma of their child being the only one without a phone. A total ban would help parents do what they want to do anyway.

But just this week, we heard something that made me think: this isn’t just about children. It’s about adults too.

Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, recently revealed something that is widely known within Silicon Valley. And as the co-founder and CEO of a tech company myself, I hear it all the time. The revelation? The aim of tech firms is to make their products “addictive.”

As Tucker Carlson noted on his own Fox News show, the bosses of Big Tobacco knew their product was addictive too. They just weren’t as open about it as Sean Parker.

As viewers of “The Next Revolution” know, despite (or perhaps because of) living in Silicon Valley and running a tech firm, I’m a critic of technology’s impact on society. I myself don’t have a cellphone. But I nevertheless recognize the positive things that technology brings.

Facebook (disclosure: my wife is a senior executive there) has enabled a previously unimaginable flourishing of small businesses – including my own – by making it possible for them to reach customers in affordable ways.

Google (disclosure: my wife was once a senior executive there) has contributed to the greatest and fastest spread of knowledge in human history.

Uber (disclosure: yes, you’ve guessed it, my wife worked there too) is creating new ways for people to boost their income, as well as democratizing transportation for millions.

But if a tech skeptic like me can appreciate the positives, I think it’s time for the tech evangelists to accept the negatives too.

In any discussion of technology, you hear the same argument: You can’t turn the clock back and you can’t put the genie back in the bottle.

Maybe not. But there are steps we can take to limit the social harm caused by this industry, just like we do with others. And that brings us back to Big Tobacco and the commercialization of addiction.

Let’s start by being precise about the comparison. When it comes to Big Tech, the real transformation in addictive behavior has come about not through the internet itself, or the businesses that have grown to dominate it. It has come through the device that more and more people use to access the internet: the smartphone.

It’s the smartphone that has turned adults and children alike into tech-addicted zombies, dumbly swiping and jabbing at their screens, oblivious to the world around them.

It’s the smartphone that has trapped people in this constant, miserable hamster-wheel of updates and notifications and self-destructive comparisons with friends and celebrities, and the virtual demolition of any remaining barriers between work and personal life.

It’s the smartphone that is responsible for one of the most depressing – and increasingly ubiquitous – sights of the modern age: a family sitting together but totally detached from one another, engaged with their screens rather than the people closest to them.

Of course many companies now make smartphones. But it was the iPhone that first made them so irresistibly addictive. Apple’s Steve Jobs, idolized by so many as a hero, probably did more to undermine humanity than any other business leader in history.

If smartphones are the new smoking, here are four practical ways we can learn from the success of anti-smoking efforts and reduce the damage to mental health that smartphones cause:

Ban smartphones for kids. They should never have unsupervised access to the internet. There’s no reason that children need smartphones; if parents are concerned about staying in touch with their children, they can still give them feature phones without internet access.

Require all smartphone makers to show regular mental health warnings prominently on screens after a certain amount of usage.

Tax phone usage and direct the proceeds towards mental health programs that educate people about the safe use of technology, and help those who have been hurt by it.

Restrict smartphone use in public spaces. It’s absurd that cities around the world now have to introduce safety measures to prevent people from getting hit by cars because pedestrians are walking around buried in their phones.

Of course these measures would not solve all the problems associated with smartphones. But they would help reduce the social harm imposed by technology, while ensuring we still enjoy its many social and economic benefits.

Saudi Arabia's dramatic moves to counter Iran in the region appear to have backfired, significantly ratcheting up regional tensions and setting off a spiral of reactions and anger that seem to have caught the kingdom off guard.

Now it's trying to walk back its escalations in Lebanon and Yemen.

On Monday, the kingdom announced that the Saudi-led coalition fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen would begin reopening airports and seaports in the Arab world's poorest country, days after closing them over a rebel ballistic missile attack on Riyadh.

The move came just hours after Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who shocked the nation by announcing his resignation from the Saudi capital on Nov. 4, gave an interview in which he backed off his strident condemnation of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah, saying he would return to the country within days to seek a settlement with the Shiite militants, his rivals in his coalition government.

The two developments suggest that Saudi Arabia's bullish young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, may be trying to pedal back from the abyss of a severe regional escalation.

""This represents de-escalation by the Saudis,"" said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ""The general trend is that the Saudis are going to back off and this is largely because of the unexpected extent of international pressure, and not least of all U.S. pressure.""

Mohammed bin Salman, widely known by his initials, MBS, has garnered a reputation for being decisive, as well as impulsive.

At just 32 years old and with little experience in government, he has risen to power in just three years to oversee all major aspects of politics, security and the economy in Saudi Arabia. As defense minister, he is in charge of the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

He also appears to have the support of President Donald Trump and his son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner, who visited the Saudi capital earlier this month.

Saudi partners in the Gulf and the Trump administration rushed to defend the kingdom publicly after a rebel Houthi missile was fired at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, from Yemen last week. A top U.S. military official also backed Saudi claims that the missile was manufactured by Iran.

However, Saudi Arabia's move to tighten an already devastating blockade on Yemen in response to the missile was roundly criticized by aid groups, humanitarian workers and the United Nations, which warned that the blockade could bring millions of people closer to ""starvation and death.""

Saudi Arabia's decision to ease the blockade after just a week suggests it bowed to the international criticism, and did not want the bad publicity of even more images of emaciated Yemeni children and elderly people circulating online and in the media.

Public pressure, however, has not always worked to bring about a change in Saudi policy. The kingdom's abrupt decision, in coordination with the United Arab Emirates, to cut ties with Qatar five months ago was widely criticized as an overreach. Still, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have not backed down from their list of demands, and if anything, appear to have dug in their heels further. The kingdom accuses Qatar of backing extremists in large part due to its ties with Iran and its support of Islamist groups, an allegation that Qatar strongly denies.

While Saudi Arabia appears to have the full backing of Trump, the recent purge of top princes, officials, businessmen and military officers has raised concerns the crown prince has overextended himself. The kingdom says it has detained 201 people in the sweeping anti-corruption probe, which MBS is overseeing. The arrests raise the potential for internal strife and discord within the royal family, whose unity has been the bedrock of the kingdom for decades.

The crown prince shows no sign of backing down from the purge either. The government has promised to expand its probe, and has reportedly frozen some 1,200 bank accounts.

It is too early to say how Saudi Arabia will handle the crisis in Lebanon triggered by Hariri's resignation, and whether he will indeed try to reach a new settlement with Hezbollah as he announced in the interview Sunday night.

But his abrupt resignation, clearly engineered by the kingdom, may have been an uncalculated step too far.

The 47-year-old Saudi-aligned Hariri was summoned from Beirut to Riyadh on Nov. 3 and resigned the next day in a televised speech in which he unexpectedly tore into Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, announcing in uncharacteristically strong language that Iran's arms in the region would be ""cut off."" The resignation shattered a year-old coalition government that included Hezbollah members that had kept the calm and was just starting to make strides toward injecting some cash and confidence in the country's economy.

A political crisis has gripped Lebanon since, but instead of splitting the Lebanese, the manner of Hariri's resignation has provoked outrage among most. Convinced that he was forced to quit and was being held against his will, the Lebanese found rare unity around their demand that Hariri be allowed to return home.

The shock resignation, seen as a rash Saudi decision to drag Lebanon back to the forefront of the Saudi-Iranian battle for regional supremacy, jolted the Middle East and also took world capitals by surprise.

Already facing widespread international criticism over its crippling blockade of Yemen and skepticism over the unprecedented wave of arrests inside Saudi Arabia, the kingdom suddenly seemed like a rogue nation acting on impulse and taking the region to the brink of explosion.

If he was emboldened by the support from Trump and Kushner, the crown prince appears to have overreached.

While it took a few days, the U.S. response has been embarrassing for the kingdom.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. opposes action that would threaten the stability of Lebanon and warned other countries against using Lebanon ""as a venue for proxy conflicts"" — a statement that seemed to be directed equally at Saudi Arabia and Iran.

More surprisingly, the White House issued a strongly worded statement calling on all states and parties to respect Lebanon's sovereignty and constitutional processes, describing Hariri as a ""trusted partner of the United States in strengthening Lebanese institutions, fighting terrorism and protecting refugees.""

""I think the Saudis fundamentally misjudged this... and should have known better,"" said Sayigh, the Carnegie analyst.

""They've been relying too heavily ... on Trump's people and misjudged that the U.S. administration is not just Trump,"" he said.

On Monday morning, McHenry took shots at Kaepernick on Twitter, arguing that not only is he not worthy of the brand new title, but there were far more respectful members of the NFL worth shining a light on. McHenry first commented on Kaepernick’s previous wardrobe choice that painted police in a negative light.

“Wear socks depicting police officers as pigs; wear Fidel Castro as a fashion statement IN MIAMI; sue NFL for collusion when gf compares owners to slave owners… Win Citizen of the Year,” she wrote. “Serve in the US Military...nothing. What a joke, GQ. #Kaepernick.”

Later, she highlighted JJ Watt, who raised money for the victims of Hurricane Harvey earlier this year as someone who may be worthy of being recognized as Citizen of the Year.

“JJ Watt raised $37 million for Hurricane Harvey victims. 37 MILLION! But Kaepernick refused to stand for our national anthem (a year ago) and is Citizen of the Year. Right…”

Kaepernick has said his decision to kneel during the national anthem began as a protest about police brutality in the black communities of America. Since then, it has ballooned into an issue about free speech, respect for the flag and respect for veterans.

“For those who think I don’t get the reason for protest you’re wrong. Eagles Malcolm jenkins met with lawmakers to help community. Dolphins Kenny Stills met with Miami police. More examples of Citizen of the Year.”

They long to spend just 15 minutes back with the best friends they ever had, friends that are scattered to every corner of the earth, and some to the afterlife itself.

Vets are haunted by visions of horror and death, by guilt of somehow surviving and living the good life, when some they knew are gone. They strangely wish sometimes that they were back in those dreadful circumstances, not to experience the dirt and horror and terror and noise and violence again, but to be with the only people a vet really knows, other vets.

Civilians must understand that for a vet nothing is ever the same again. Their senses can be suddenly illuminated by the slightest sound or smell or sight: sights of death all around, a living version of Dante’s Inferno; sounds so loud that they can only be described as Saving Private Ryan in surround sound on steroids; smells vast and horrific; rotting death, burning fuel and equipment, rubber, animals and…people. The smoldering ruins of life all around them.

All vets have these thoughts nearly every day. Some may experience them for fractions of second, or for minutes at a time. They replay over and over again like an endless 24 hour war movie.

Part of the solitary world of the vet is being able to enjoy complete bliss doing absolutely nothing. This is a trait grating to civilians who must constantly search for endless stimuli. Unbeknownst to them, the greatest thrill of all is just being alive. A lot of vets have an Obi-wan Kenobi calmness. After what they went through, how bad can anything really be?

As King said to Chris in Platoon, “Make it outta here, it’s all gravy, every day of the rest of your life – gravy…”

So many, if not all vets walk around each day lost in their own special story. They were once great actors on a giant stage with speaking parts and props. Maybe they were heroes and now they aren’t anymore. Maybe they helped save the world and now they can’t. Maybe they gave orders and now they take them. Maybe they thought that they could accomplish anything and now they know they can’t. Perhaps their lives now are smaller and slower and sometimes in the vet’s mind, just incidental, even though they’re not.

Most civilians are oblivious to the solitary life of the vet. But, it’s there. It’s the same eternal and universal philosophy, whether you fought in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq or Afghanistan. The experiences may have been different, but the emotions are the same.

A problem with the solitary world of the vet is that the vet has a hard time explaining what he or she did to those who didn’t serve. Some vets want to talk, but they have no outlet. Maybe their only outlet is watching a war movie or reading a book about the conflict they were in.

How often do people say, “Grandpa never talks about Korea.” That’s because Grandpa knows no one can understand except other vets. That’s because Grandpa knows most people don’t care.

Part of this taciturn mentality is that vets speak another language, a strange and archaic language of their past. How do you talk to civilians about “fire for effect” or “grid 7310” or “shake and bake” or “frag orders” or “10 days and a wake up” or a thousand and one other terms that are mystifying to the real world?

You can’t.

All of this adds to the solitary world of the vet. Some are better at handling life afterwards than others. Some don’t seem affected at all, but they are. They just hide it. Some never return to normal. But, what is normal to a vet anymore?

So, this Veterans’ Day, if you see a vet sitting by themselves at a restaurant or on a train or shopping at the grocery store alone, take a moment to speak with them. Take them out of their solitary world for a moment. You’ll be happy you did.",Veterans Day: The solitary world of a vet,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/11/veterans-day-solitary-world-vet.html

At the time, Sosa said the cream, along with the bright TV lights, made his skin appear lighter than it is. He did not specify why he was using the cream, but it came at a time when many were linking his changing looks to steroid use.

“I don’t think I look like Michael Jackson,” he said.

On Monday morning, McHenry took shots at Kaepernick on Twitter, arguing that not only is he not worthy of the brand new title, but there were far more respectful members of the NFL worth shining a light on. McHenry first commented on Kaepernick’s previous wardrobe choice that painted police in a negative light.

“Wear socks depicting police officers as pigs; wear Fidel Castro as a fashion statement IN MIAMI; sue NFL for collusion when gf compares owners to slave owners… Win Citizen of the Year,” she wrote. “Serve in the US Military...nothing. What a joke, GQ. #Kaepernick.”

Later, she highlighted JJ Watt, who raised money for the victims of Hurricane Harvey earlier this year as someone who may be worthy of being recognized as Citizen of the Year.

“JJ Watt raised $37 million for Hurricane Harvey victims. 37 MILLION! But Kaepernick refused to stand for our national anthem (a year ago) and is Citizen of the Year. Right…”

Kaepernick has said his decision to kneel during the national anthem began as a protest about police brutality in the black communities of America. Since then, it has ballooned into an issue about free speech, respect for the flag and respect for veterans.

“For those who think I don’t get the reason for protest you’re wrong. Eagles Malcolm jenkins met with lawmakers to help community. Dolphins Kenny Stills met with Miami police. More examples of Citizen of the Year.”

For me, there wasn’t a question of whether or not I would enlist. My parents raised me to believe that it was an honor to serve my country. While the war was a painful and brutal experience, I never lost sight of the fact that I was serving my nation and the cause of freedom.

Today I am 92 years old. Though my military service ended decades ago, my commitment to service is still very much a part of my life. I’m living proof that you are never too old to serve others.

Of course the way I serve looks a lot different today than it did during the war. But my volunteering today has its roots in my experience during the war.

I have always cared about the wellbeing of kids. During the war, we would see kids in Germany living in dumpsters because they had lost both of their parents and were starving. We would give them the scraps after we got our share of food. These kids had nothing. It really had an impact on me and made me want to do things to help them. When it came to children, there were no sides and no enemies.

Following the war, when I was back home in New Jersey, my wife and I would take in kids who needed a safe place to live. I helped run a Little League baseball team in East Marion, New York. Caring for kids and making their lives better has always been a priority for me.

Years later, I started to pack shoebox gifts for Operation Christmas Child. This is a program that brings simple gifts to kids in need around the world—many of whom have never received a present in their lives. We have filled thousands of shoeboxes with school supplies, small cars, stuffed animals, and practical things like soap and toothbrushes.

But the best thing I can give to these kids through Operation Christmas Child is the gift of hope and God’s love.

During World War II, I was missing in action two different times. My bags got shipped home on both occasions. It scared my mother each time. Throughout the war, though, my faith in God’s love sustained me and earned me the nickname “the preacher.” Without the gift of hope, I don’t know that I would have survived.

And so for nearly the past two decades, I have tried to share that gift with children around the world. For me, that has meant standing outside of shoe stores to ask shoppers to give me their empty shoeboxes so that my family and I can fill them with gifts as part of Operation Christmas Child. It also has meant turning my daughter’s house into a workshop where my family has packed thousands of shoebox gifts. Even in my nineties, serving others is still an important and rewarding part of my life.

This year I celebrated my 72nd Veteran’s Day. I planned to mark the day by helping my family reach their goal of packing 1,000 shoebox gifts for children in need.

The study is the first to examine sexual activity as a potential trigger for sudden cardiac arrest among the general population, the researchers said.
People who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest during sex tended to be slightly younger, around 60 years old on average, than those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times, who were around 65 years old on average.
But those who had a sudden cardiac arrest during sex were just as likely to have a heart condition or be on heart medication as those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times.
""Multiple research studies have shown that CPR performed by bystanders … can improve the chances of survival from cardiac arrest,"" Chugh said.","Can having sex cause your heart to suddenly stop beating? A new study suggests that, although this can happen, it's very rare.

In the study, researchers analyzed information from more than 4,500 people who experienced sudden cardiac arrest, a condition in which the heart abruptly stops beating due to problems with the heart's electrical activity.

Among these cases, less than 1 percent of cardiac arrests occurred during or immediately after sexual activity, the study found.

The study is the first to examine sexual activity as a potential trigger for sudden cardiac arrest among the general population, the researchers said. The findings were presented on Nov. 12 at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions meeting in Anaheim, California, and are published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

""While sudden cardiac arrest is a devastating condition with a high chance of death, the likelihood of this occurring during sexual activity … was extremely low,"" said Dr. Sumeet Chugh, medical director of the Heart Rhythm Center at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles and senior author of the study.

""This is a reassurance that can now be provided to heart disease patients, and will be based on actual data,"" Chugh told Live Science.

In the rare instances in which sex was linked with cardiac arrest, almost all of the cases — 94 percent — were in men, the study found: Among men, about 1 in 100 cases of cardiac arrest were linked with sex, compared with just 1 in 1,000 cases among women.

People who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest during sex tended to be slightly younger, around 60 years old on average, than those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times, who were around 65 years old on average.

But those who had a sudden cardiac arrest during sex were just as likely to have a heart condition or be on heart medication as those who had a sudden cardiac arrest at other times.

The study also found that, even though sudden cardiac arrest linked with sexual activity was usually witnessed by the person's partner, bystander CPR was performed in only one-third of cases. (Bystander CPR is CPR that is performed by a witness until an ambulance shows up.) These findings highlight the need to educate the public about the importance of CPR for sudden-cardiac-arrest patients, the researchers said.

""Multiple research studies have shown that CPR performed by bystanders … can improve the chances of survival from cardiac arrest,"" Chugh said. ""It stands to reason that if CPR is learned [and] performed by all sexual partners, there is a good possibility of improving survival.""

TIGHAR’s theory differs with that of a new History Channel documentary, which showcases the newly unearthed photo and experts claiming that the image is proof that Earhart and Noonan survived the crash and died in Japanese captivity.
The photo, which allegedly shows Earhart and Noonan on a dock in the Marhsall Islands, was recently discovered in the National Archives.
“Indeed, a new documentary from the History Channel resurfaces a photograph that purports to show Earhart and Noonan in the Marshalls some years after they disappeared.

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) said it believes that Earhart — the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean — and her navigator, Fred Noonan, died as castaways on Nikumaroro, a desolate island in the central Pacific Ocean after landing there.

Last month, four border collies named Marcy, Piper, Kayle, and Berkeley and their handlers were sent to the island as part of an expedition sponsored by TIGHAR and the National Geographic Society with the hope of solving the mystery of the ill-fated American pilot.

The dogs detected the scent of human remains, the researchers said.

“Within moments of beginning to work the site, Berkeley, a curly red male, lay down at the base of a ren tree, eyes locked on his handler, Lynne Angeloro,” according to National Geographic. “The dog was ‘alerting,’ indicating to Angeloro that he had detected the scent of human remains.

“Next up was Kayle, a fluffy, eager-to-please female. She also alerted on the same spot. The next day, Marcy and Piper, two black-and-white collies, were brought to the site. Both dogs alerted.

“The signals were clear: Someone — perhaps Earhart or her navigator, Fred Noonan — had died beneath the ren tree.”

Still, Fred Hiebert, National Geographic’s archaeologist-in-residence, said the odds of actually extracting DNA from a tropical environment such as Nikumaroro’s are slim.

TIGHAR’s theory differs with that of a new History Channel documentary, which showcases the newly unearthed photo and experts claiming that the image is proof that Earhart and Noonan survived the crash and died in Japanese captivity.

The US declared Earhart dead two years after her disappearance during her attempt to fly around the world, asserting she must have crashed somewhere in the Pacific Ocean after running out of fuel.

“I’m glad that we were able to get him the ball, especially on a day like today for him,” 49ers safety Eric Reid told SFGate. “I have so much respect for him, to come out here and still play, with the hurt that he had in his heart, and to ball out.”

Morgan Goodwin also posted on Instagram that she had to deliver her “precious baby boy early this morning due to pre-term labor.

“Despite our loss, my hubby kept grinding, scored his son a touchdown & got our first “W” of the season,” she added. “He had a wonderful game today. I appreciate everyone who kept us in their prayers and constantly checked in on us.

Reid and Goodwin both kneeled during the national anthem before the game started, along with Giants’ defensive end Olivier Vernon.

“If I need to say it every time ya’ll ask me, this is not about the military, this is not about the flag, this is not about the anthem,” Reid said earlier this year, according to the Washington Post. “I have the utmost respect for the military, for the anthem, for the flag. So I will say that every time ya’ll interview me.

It wasn’t long before football players across the fruited plain, from pee-wee to professional, emulated Mr. Kaepernick’s unpatriotic protest. Even a few cheerleaders dropped their pom-poms in a show of solidarity.

They said they were protesting alleged racial inequality and police brutality, but it’s pretty clear to most of the country that Mr. Kaepernick and his minions were dishonoring the flag, the anthem and the military.

GQ, the magazine for emasculated men, hailed Mr. Kaepernick as a “powerful symbol of activism and resistance.”

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness. That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

The designation came in the magazine’s annual “Men of the Year” edition – subtitled, “The New American Heroes.”

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness.

That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

“In my view, the most pernicious element of white backlash against Colin’s protest has been the way in which the narrative has been co-opted and re-framed so that taking a knee is now somehow synonymous with disrespecting the flag, with a lack of patriotism,” scholar Christopher Petrella wrote in a GQ essay.

Activist Linda Sarsour, co-founder of the “Nasty Woman” march heralded the failed professional football player as a genuine American hero.

“There might even be a day when we’ll be walking down Colin Kaepernick Boulevard and people will remember what Colin Kaepernick did, just like we remember Muhammad Ali,” she wrote in a GQ essay. “And I truly believe that in my heart.”

It's quite telling when you consider who did not make the GQ “Citizen of the Year” list.

Marine veteran Taylor Weston commandeered a pickup truck and rushed victims of the Las Vegas massacre to the hospital. He did not make the list.

Nor did Stephen Willeford, the Texas plumber who grabbed a gun and ran barefoot towards the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. His actions stopped a mad man from killing even more innocent people.

The all-volunteer Cajun Navy did not make the list either. They pulled hundreds of citizens from the floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

And the hundreds of teenage football players who honored our flag and our troops by staging patriotic, pre-game celebrations did not make the list either.

GQ’s definition of what it means to be a good citizen and a good man and a hero is a bit puzzling.

They seem to believe the epitome of manhood is taking a knee. But I say the true measure of a man is taking a stand.",GQ should've named Colin Kaepernick its 'Coward of the Year',http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/13/gq-shouldve-named-colin-kapernick-its-coward-year.html

About a week ahead of the planned Oct. 28 engagement party, Haber had met with her transplant team to discuss her options and was told that she wasn’t a good candidate for a second surgery. It was then that she and her fiancé, Bryan Takayama, decided to forego the party and get married instead.

In an Instagram post honoring the day, Haber, who has over 72,000 followers, reposted part of their vows in which she promised to stick by Takayama even when the Ohio State Buckeyes lose, and apologized for not being able to be in his life forever.

You inspire me to fight harder, to put myself through struggle, to look past chaos, to drink ensures and to take my medication.”

As the pair, who met last year at a friend’s wedding, scrambled to make arrangements, others stepped forward to cover the cost of a venue, food, Haber’s dress, hair and make-up, KTVU reported. They shared their first dance as husband and wife while Jason Mraz’s “I’m Yours” played.

“It was a chance for us to intimately share a few moments to a song that holds true importance to us and just for us to be us,” Takayama told KTVU.

Haber said she was having trouble breathing near the end of the song, so Takayama picked her up and held her until the end.

A GoFundMe page was set up to send the newlyweds on a honeymoon to Hawaii, which was approved by Haber’s doctor as long as a medical team is on-call for the duration of the trip. She is also meeting with other high-risk transplant centers to discuss other therapies that will prolong her lifespan.

At the time, Sosa said the cream, along with the bright TV lights, made his skin appear lighter than it is. He did not specify why he was using the cream, but it came at a time when many were linking his changing looks to steroid use.

“I don’t think I look like Michael Jackson,” he said.

I look forward to informing and entertaining the audience and introducing new voices to the conversation.”

The Ingraham Angle will aim to cut through the Washington chatter to speak directly with unexpected voices and the actual people who are impacted by the news of the day. Ingraham will challenge the decision makers to focus on everyday, hard-working Americans who serve as the backbone of the nation. The program will also highlight the importance of faith in our nation and reveal stories that showcase the American spirit.

Ingraham joined FNC in 2007 and most recently served as a contributor, providing political analysis and commentary to FNC’s daytime and primetime programming. She will continue hosting her radio program, The Laura Ingraham Show, where she is the most-listened-to woman in political talk radio on hundreds of stations nationwide.

[It] impacts their emotional well-being.”For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash.
And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back.
The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood.
We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies.","This past weekend the Wall Street Journal published what I consider to be the most important op-ed of the 21st century. Due to its sensitive nature, Americans rarely hear about this subject. But they should.

The article, by James Taranto, is entitled “The Politicization of Motherhood,” and it centers on an interview with psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, whose new book “Being There: Why Prioritizing Motherhood in the First Three Years Matters,” makes the oh-so-obvious yet controversial argument that babies need their mothers.

As Komisar says in a video about her book, “Mothers are critically important to children in the first three years of life. [It] impacts their emotional well-being.”

For daring to write such a book, Komisar has received the inevitable backlash. After all, it’s taboo enough to suggest parents should stay home. It’s even more taboo to suggest that parent be Mom. Why? Because popular orthodoxy insists the sexes are interchangeable. That’s what the gender equality crowd believes, and it’s what they want everyone else to believe.

If you don’t agree with it (and you shouldn’t, because it isn’t true), you’ll be treated as a pariah. “I couldn’t get on NPR,” Komisar told Taranto. And, she adds, she was “rejected wholesale—particularly in New York—by the liberal press.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

Komisar did manage to get a spot on “Good Morning America;” but prior to the interview, host Lara Spencer made it clear to Komisar that she didn’t like her book and didn’t “believe in its premise.”

Well, of course she didn’t. Morning television is dominated by female producers and journalists, many of whom are married with kids. And as Bernard Goldberg wrote in “Bias,” “…those gals got a dog in this fight.” He adds, “America’s newsrooms are filled with women who drop their kids off someplace before they go to work or leave them at home with a nanny. These journalists are not just defending working mothers—they’re defending themselves!”

How rich I’d be if I had a dollar for every time I’ve run into this media bias. My first book, which was published 15 years ago (and was coincidentally re-released this year), is similar to Komisar’s in that I make a case for why a mother’s physical and emotional presence are vital to children, to families and to society as a whole. And I too was vilified in the media.

And yet my goal, aside from supporting the work mothers at home do, is no different from Komisar’s: “We don’t want the 50s to come back. What we do want is to be a child-centric society.”

Not the kind of child-centric society we have now, where children are coddled by well-meaning but overprotective parents.

The kind that puts the needs of children above the needs of adults.

Unfortunately, Komisar and I part ways on how to create such a society. As a political liberal, Komisar believes the answer is other people’s money. “All mothers and babies should have the right to be together in the first year,” she says. To do that, America needs maternity leave at full pay “and then flexibility to be together as much as possible for the next two years—meaning mothers should have the ability to work flexibly and part time.”

It is true that flexibility and part-time work become indispensable once children are older and in school all day, but it’s pointless in the first three years. The needs and demands of a baby, let alone a baby and a toddler, are simply too great to be able devote one’s attention to something else without everything falling apart.

Still, there is much Komisar gets right. Her case is particularly compelling because her work has been developed from “three decades’ experience treating families,” writes Taranto. And her conclusions are right on the mark—though admittedly, for some, are hard to hear.

“What I was seeing,” notes Komisar, “was an increase in children being diagnosed with ADHD and an increase in aggression in children, especially in boys, and an increase in depression in little girls.” She saw that the absence of mothers in children’s daily lives was “one of the triggers for these mental disorders.”

Addressing the effects of maternal absence is difficult enough on its own, but it’s impossible when, as Taranto points out, liberals—who, as we all know, dominate mainstream media—“won’t even acknowledge the problem.”

They won’t acknowledge it because they refuse to allow themselves, or anyone else, to feel guilty about the choices they’ve made—as if experiencing this emotion is tantamount to being tortured.

But it isn’t the end of the world to feel guilt. “My best patient is a patient who comes to me feeling guilty,” says Komisar. “Women who feel guilty—it’s a ‘signal’ feeling, that something’s wrong, that they’re in conflict. If they go talk to a therapist or deal with the conflict head-on, they often make different choices and better choices.”

And one of those choices, to prioritize baby care well in advance of its arrival, is a smart one. The only reason women don’t do this today is because we place so little value on motherhood. We don’t understand the significance of what goes on the early years and how indispensable mothers are to their babies. We don’t understand it because we refuse to look.

But the information is there for all who choose to see.",It's time we acknowledge how indispensable mothers are to their babies,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/31/its-time-acknowledge-how-indispensable-mothers-are-to-their-babies.html

Under President Trump’s strong leadership, the Department of Justice has made restoring the rule of law our top priority. Everything we do is guided by this principle.

Under the previous administration, parties who had been sued by the government and then settled the lawsuit were sometimes required to pay community organizations that were not even involved in the case or harmed by the defendant. That was not only wrong, but contrary to longstanding legal principles, and we have put a stop to it. Lawsuit settlements with the government should not be used to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the friends of whomever is in power. They should help compensate victims or go to the taxpayer. Now that is what they will do.

We are also trusting our prosecutors again and letting them do their jobs. The previous administration forced them to leave out important facts in drug cases to achieve sentences lighter than were required by the law. Federal drug prosecutions—and sentences—went down dramatically. Meanwhile drug deaths rose to unprecedented levels.

We have removed this restriction on our prosecutors and told them to target the most violent criminals. They have already achieved significant results, with charges for federal gun crimes up nearly a quarter.

Under this administration, the Department of Justice is serving the American people by following the laws they have duly enacted—and we are just getting started.

The rule of law means abiding by all of our laws. Restoring the rule of law therefore requires enforcing our immigration laws.

We are rewarding those jurisdictions that assist federal law enforcement—not those who refuse to, like “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Our law enforcement grants now have conditions to encourage our state and local partners to help us remove criminal aliens from this country. Politicians have no right to protect criminals or promote lawlessness.

Neither do those entrusted with classified information. Leaks break the public trust and threaten public safety. That is why we tripled the number of active investigations into leaks. We have already charged four people with unlawfully disclosing classified material or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers.

When necessary, we go to court to keep the American people safe, such as when we defend the president’s right to protect this country from security threats. We are defending the president’s clear legal right to stop the entry of those who cannot be adequately vetted. Numerous judges—and two district courts—have upheld the president’s travel ban, and we are confident that it will stand.

The Department cannot, however, defend illegal actions. That is why we advised the administration to end the previous administration’s unlawful Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA. This policy was contrary to our immigration laws and did not have Congressional approval—indeed, Congress rejected similar legislative proposals numerous times.

For the same reason, the Department has agreed to settlement terms with 469 Tea Party and other conservative groups whose tax-exempt applications were delayed by the IRS based on inappropriate criteria including conservative names and policy positions, and civil cases with 90 plaintiffs regarding the previous administration’s contraception mandate. These cases never should have been necessary.

Religious liberty is an inalienable right, and at the president’s direction, we issued legal guidance on how to properly interpret and apply legal protections for religious liberty. And it is not just freedom of worship: we do not give up our religious freedom when we are at work, when we interact with the federal government, or any other time we participate in society.

We do not give up our rights when we go to school, either. This Department is standing up for those whose rights have been violated on campus, including supporting a lawsuit by one young man who was punished for discussing his faith outside of his school’s tiny “free speech zone.” And we are examining a case where Asian-American students allege racial discrimination in one university’s admissions.

But when you are following the Lord and his directions for marriage, it really is an awesome journey.","One of my wife Terrie’s favorite travel stories took place well before GPS units and smartphones were around. We were visiting New York City with another couple and had rented a car. The ladies were sitting in the back seat and the men in the front, with me driving. We were headed to a meeting and enjoying the iconic landmarks along the way.

When we noticed we were seeing the same landmarks multiple times, it became apparent that we didn’t know the way. Finally, after several pointed hints from the back seat, I pulled in to a gas station to ask for directions.

We two men talked to someone outside pumping gas. The ladies could see from our informant’s gestures that he felt confident as he gave directions, and they could see us nodding as we listened.

We got back in the car, however, and my friend and I asked each other in unison, “What did he say?” As it turned out, the man who gave us directions didn’t know much English. Neither of us wanted to say that we couldn’t understand, so instead, we both nodded along, assuming the other really did understand.

That scenario is a picture of so many couples in our culture. When it comes to marriage, couples often know they are not where they want to be – and nowhere near where they dreamed that marriage would take them. But when they look for help, they get input from sources who give garbled directions and mixed messages.

Our culture is, at best, confused on the meaning and significance of marriage and relationships. It’s amazing to me, for instance, that in the same month our culture praised the late Playboy Magazine founder Hugh Hefner, who objectified women, we condemned film producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has been accused by more than 90 women of sexual assault or harassment and is being investigated by police in New York, California and Britain.

In reality, the stories of both men are many shades of deplorable and tragic. But to add insult to injury, recall that several months previous the “celebrity story” dominating the news was how ridiculous it was for Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to have lunch alone with a woman other than his wife.

Apparently, objectifying women is OK, taking advantage of them is bad (as long as it’s in real life and not in a movie you pay to watch), but setting personal guidelines to protect the sanctity of your own marriage is also bad.

Hollywood, media and our culture provide conflicting directions. And couples who base their relationship on these sources are sure to become confused. We simply can’t follow a sloppy map and be surprised when it leads us to a different destination than we wanted to go.

At some point, you have to wonder. What was so bad about God’s plan for marriage? God created marriage to be awesome. In the actual words of Genesis, he made it “very good” (Genesis 1:31).

And in the very first wedding ceremony of human history, God gave specific, not-difficult-to-understand directions for marriage: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh” (Genesis 2:18–24). This passage is so significant that Jesus quoted from it and the apostle Paul referenced it. The directions it gives for marriage are simple, and you can remember them with three rhyming words—leave, cleave and weave.

Leave: When a couple begins a marriage, they are establishing a new identity together. And that necessitates leaving previous problems, identities and hang-ups behind – both physically and emotionally. This doesn’t mean that the bride and groom have lost their personal identities. It simply means they are leaving their previous family units and their identities as separate from each other to create a new home in which they are inseparably joined.

Cleave: God designed marriage to be a relationship where partners cleave to one another – like glue, they are united. To cleave to one another with total acceptance and unconditional love for each another. The world believes that couples who stay married 50, 60 and 70 years must have been perfect for each other – that their success is rooted in the fact that they were two lucky people who found their soul mates and that the rest of us mortals are foolish to insist on cleaving to one another during times of pain or difficulty.

The world is wrong. Marriage, as God designed it, carries a commitment to cleave – to hold onto your spouse. Obviously, there are times when one spouse makes wrong decisions and walks away from an innocent party. But when two people focus on the same person – the Lord Jesus – they also draw close to one another and gain strength to keep their commitment to each other.

Weave: In one sense, becoming “one flesh” refers to physical intimacy. But in a larger sense, this is where the real work of marriage comes in. It is the intertwining of lives that happens over time. Marital intimacy is a gift of God, the physical celebration of oneness and unity. But the weaving of two lives together is more than physical. It takes place through daily decisions to pursue your spouse’s heart, to draw near to each other in acceptance, to entwine your lives around each other.

Every journey needs a map. And when it comes to marriage, the truth is, your source of directions matters. A couple that follows Hollywood’s map should not be surprised when they have a Hollywood-typical marriage – outwardly glamorous, but inwardly hollow.

What better map to follow than from the originator of marriage? When you take two people who are committed to one another and are daily drawing nearer to the Lord, there is an ongoing pattern of growth. This isn’t the result of one day, but of habits carried out day after day as together they walk through life and strengthen their relationship.

When it comes to the journey of marriage, none of us has “arrived.” It’s a lifelong journey that includes detours, bumps, mistakes and growth. But when you are following the Lord and his directions for marriage, it really is an awesome journey.","To achieve a good marriage, God’s plan will give you good directions",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/11/to-achieve-good-marriage-god-s-plan-will-give-good-directions.html

The answer is no.

Not the Congress. Not his secretary of defense. And by design, not the military officers who would be duty-bound to execute the order.

As Bruce Blair, a former nuclear missile launch officer and expert on nuclear command and control, has put it, ""The protocol for ordering the use of nuclear weapons endows every president with civilization-ending power."" Trump, he wrote in a Washington Post column last summer, ""has unchecked authority to order a preventive nuclear strike against any nation he wants with a single verbal direction to the Pentagon war room.""

Or, as then-Vice President Dick Cheney explained in December 2008, the president ""could launch a kind of devastating attack the world's never seen. He doesn't have to check with anybody. He doesn't have to call the Congress. He doesn't have to check with the courts.""

And the world has changed even more in the decade since, with North Korea posing a bigger and more immediate nuclear threat than had seemed possible. The nature of the U.S. political world has changed, too, and Trump's opponents — even within his own party — question whether he has too much power over nuclear weapons.

These realities will converge Tuesday in a Senate hearing room where the Foreign Relations Committee — headed by one of Trump's strongest Republican critics, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee — will hear testimony from a former commander of the Pentagon's nuclear war fighting command and other witnesses. The topic: ""Authority to order the use of nuclear weapons.""

Corker said numerous lawmakers have raised questions about legislative and presidential war-making authorities and the use of America's nuclear arsenal.

""This discussion is long overdue,"" Corker said in announcing the hearing.

Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science at the Stevens Institute of Technology who has researched and written extensively about presidential nuclear authority, said he hopes the discussion ""might shed some more light on aspects of the procedures for presidential use of nuclear weapons that I think really needs to be known and talked about.""

He said the U.S. system has evolved through tradition and precedent more than by laws.

""The technology of the bomb itself does not compel this sort of arrangement,"" he wrote in an email exchange. ""This is a product of circumstances. I think the circumstances under which the system was created, and the world we now live in, are sufficiently different that we could, and perhaps should, contemplate revision of the system.""

Asked about this Monday in an impromptu exchange at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was reluctant to describe his role in nuclear strike decision-making. ""I'm the president's principal adviser on the use of force,"" he said. Asked whether he was comfortable with the system as it exists, he said, ""I am,"" but did not elaborate.

Some aspects of presidential nuclear war-making powers are secret and therefore not well understood by the public. The system is built for fast decision-making, not debate. That's because speed is seen as essential in a crisis with a nuclear peer like Russia. Unlike North Korea, Russia has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the U.S. in minutes.

Russia's long-range missiles could reach the U.S. in about 30 minutes. Submarine-launched missiles fired from nearer U.S. shores might arrive in half that time. Given that some of the U.S. response time would be taken up by administrative steps, the president would have less than 10 minutes to absorb the information, review his options and make his decision, according to a December 2016 report by nuclear arms specialist Amy Woolf of the Congressional Research Service.

A president who decided to launch a nuclear attack — either in retaliation for a nuclear strike or in anticipation of one — would first hold an emergency conference with the defense secretary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and other advisers. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command, now Air Force Gen. John Hyten, would brief the president on strike options, and the president would make his decision.

The president would communicate his decision and transmit his authorization through a device called the nuclear football, a suitcase carried by a military aide. It's equipped with communication tools and a book with prepared war plans.

If the president decided to order a strike, he would identify himself to military officials at the Pentagon with codes unique to him. These codes are recorded on a card known as the biscuit that is carried by the president at all times. He would then transmit the launch order to the Pentagon and Strategic Command.

Blair, the former missile launch officer, said there is no way to reverse the president's order. And there would be no recalling missiles once launched.

Although fielded and assigned for use by the military, the nuclear bomb is inherently a political weapon, given its almost unimaginable destructive capacity. That explains why the system for controlling the use of U.S. nuclear weapons has been designed to concentrate decision-making power in the ultimate political office: the presidency.",Could anyone stop Trump from launching nukes?

The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah is at the center of the recent crisis that has gripped Lebanon and rattled a region already rife with conflict.

When Saudi-backed Prime Minister Saad Hariri declared his resignation in a surprise announcement from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, he blamed Hezbollah for imposing itself on the country and doing the bidding of its main backer, Iran, in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region.

The one-time local Shiite guerrilla army that rallied Lebanon's Shiites and battled Israel — even earning admiration from the region's Sunnis— has turned into a powerful, well-armed group caught up in the Iran-Saudi rivalry that is shaping the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia singled Hezbollah out, accusing it of declaring war on the kingdom, just as the U.S. ratcheted up its pressure on Iran and imposed new sanctions on Hezbollah, which it considers a terrorist group.

Here is a look at the 35-year old militant group, its sources of power and regional role.

BEGINNINGS and LEADERS

Hezbollah was formed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in 1982 to fight Israel's invasion of Beirut. Under the leadership of Hassan Nasrallah, who took over in 1992 after his predecessor, Abbas Mussawi, was killed in an Israeli airstrike, the group moved from seeking to implement an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon to focusing on fighting Israel and integration into Lebanon's sectarian-based politics. Nasrallah, now 57, has played a key role in ending a feud among Shiites, focusing attention toward fighting Israel and later expanding the group's regional reach.

WARS WITH ISRAEL

Hezbollah became the main militant group opposing Israel and the buffer zone it established in southern Lebanon in 1985. In 1996, Israel launched an offensive to end the guerrilla attacks, striking Lebanese power stations and killing more than 100 Lebanese civilians sheltering in a U.N. base. A year later, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed in a commando raid in the south.

Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 was hailed as a victory for Hezbollah. In the same year, Hezbollah captured three Israeli soldiers and a businessman in cross border raids, and later negotiated a swap in 2004, releasing hundreds of prisoners and fighters.

Then in 2006, Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid, sparking a 34-day war that killed 159 Israelis and more than 1,000 Lebanese.

A U.N.-brokered cease-fire brought thousands of international peacekeeping troops to police the Israeli-Lebanese border.

HEZBOLLAH AT HOME

Hezbollah's popularity at home didn't only stem from its opposition to Israel. With a weak Lebanese state, the Iranian-sponsored group, like most other sects, provided a vast array of social services for its supporters, through education, health and social networks. But as the militant group sought more executive and legislative powers following Israel's 2000 withdrawal, it worked to funnel some of its support through state institutions to reach the broader public.

Another turning point came in 2008, when heavily armed Hezbollah fighters seized control of vast parts of Beirut, flexing its power domestically for the first time. The show of force followed attempts by Lebanon's Western-backed government to curb the militants' influence by dismantling its telecommunication network.

Hezbollah has been the most powerful player in Lebanon's politics ever since. Saudi Arabia and Iran, which backed opposite sides inside Lebanon, ended a two-year deadlock over electing a president by tacitly approving a power-sharing deal that effectively enshrined Hezbollah's new powerful role. With that, Hariri, a Sunni, headed a unity government and Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, became president.

REGIONAL FOOTPRINT

Hezbollah sent its gunmen to fight alongside the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2012, providing a significant boost to the overstretched military, and turning the tide of the war. It was also crucial to safeguarding the Shiite militant group's access to Syria, the land corridor through which it is believed to get its weapons from Iran.

Citing estimates based on diplomatic reports and open-source data, Thanassis Cambanis, a fellow at the Century Foundation, said some 20,000 to 30,000 armed men, including 4,000 core fighters as well as local militiamen and tribesmen are under Hezbollah's command in the fighting in Syria and Lebanon.

This war has allowed Hezbollah's fighters to improve their interoperability, working closely with the Russian military and other Iranian-backed militias from Iraq or Afghanistan.

Hezbollah is also believed to have increased its military facilities in Syria's Qalamoun mountains and in the Golan Heights, as well as throughout Lebanon. It is believed to have built munitions factories there and Israeli officials estimate it has an arsenal of 150,000 missiles.

""It has crossed a military threshold,"" Cambanis said. ""Hezbollah today possesses a credible deterrent against pre-emptive war by its opponents.""

Hezbollah backing for Yemen's Houthi rebels has been harder to prove, though the structure and rhetoric of the Shiite Yemeni group mirrors that of Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia accuses Hezbollah and Iran of providing the Houthis with training and financial support in the stalemated war that is causing a humanitarian disaster.

Saudi authorities said a recently intercepted missile near Riyadh airport, the longest-range yet used by the Houthis, had Iranian markings, confirmed by the Americans. In addition, small arms shipments allegedly from Iran were confiscated before reaching Yemen. And Saudi TV networks have aired what they say was evidence of Hezbollah fighters training the Houthis.",Hezbollah at the center of Lebanon's current crisis,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/13/hezbollah-at-center-lebanons-current-crisis.html

“It's a boom market on TV for anyone who wants to take a swing at the president.” - Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor

Trump was simply repeating what Putin told him, but the mainstream media quickly criticized the president for appearing to accept Putin's assurances. Trump was forced to clarify his remarks, saying he believes that Putin “feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,” not that the White House actually believes him.

Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor said the “easiest route to appearing on TV -- especially anti-Trump CNN” is to bash the president.

“It doesn't matter what you will say. All that matters is the target. Everything else you have done, everything that might discredit you will likely be downplayed or forgotten,” Gainor told Fox News. “It's a boom market on TV for anyone who wants to take a swing at the president.”

Trump eventually blasted former intelligence officials who have attempted to dissect every syllable of his comments about Putin, calling them “political hacks,” but Brennan took it as a compliment.

""He was referring to us as political hacks because he was trying to delegitimize the intelligence community assessment,"" Brennan said. ""Considering the source of the criticism, I consider that criticism a badge of honor.”

Clapper and Brennan appeared together Sunday on CNN""s ""State of the Union"" for a 16-minute interview seemingly designed to fire up anyone who thinks Russia’s alleged election interference isn’t in the news enough these days. Clapper and Brennan told host Jake Tapper that Russians don’t have good intentions when it comes to the United States and essentially mocked Trump because he didn’t publically call Putin a liar.

""The threat posed by Russia, as John just said, is manifest and obvious. To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding, and in fact, poses a peril to this country,” Brennan said.

Clapper claimed that the Chinese and Russians think they can “play” Trump, while Brennan complained that Trump would attack his critics on Veteran’s Day and even said the president is “intimidated” by Putin. Clips from the ""State of the Union"" interview were replayed throughout the day on CNN and are embedded in a variety of the network’s digital content.

CNN is clearly proud of its ability to get former intelligence chiefs to criticize the president, as the network’s website featured two headlines -- leading the homepage political section – with quotes from Clapper and Brennan nearly 24 hours after the joint interview.",CNN uses former intelligence chiefs to push anti-Trump agenda,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/13/cnn-uses-former-intelligence-chiefs-to-push-anti-trump-agenda.html

He’s saying agree with me or be banished.
A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump.
But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally).","The Sunday “New York Times” published an op-ed that’s causing a stir: “Can My Children Be Friends With White People?”

It’s by Ekow N. Yankah, a Professor of Law at Cardozo. He’s an African-American who’s got sons, the eldest a four-year-old.

According to Yankah, Donald Trump’s election means he’ll have to teach his sons that racism will continue to be a deep part of the American character, and that they’ll have to learn to be suspicious. “Much sooner than I thought I would, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.”

He goes on to explain that real friendship only happens where there’s trust, and no desire to wield power over the other.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Surprisingly, Yankah claims his childhood in a “Midwestern college town [....] lacked the deep racial tension and mistrust that seem so hard to escape now.”

There’s tension today, yes, but there was tension a few decades ago when he was a kid — maybe he just didn’t notice.

How is it that the election of Trump, following Barack Obama’s two terms, was a turning point in race relations, even if it only supposedly revealed what was there all along? Nevertheless, with Trump if office, Yankah notes for many minorities “the ridiculous thing was thinking friendship was possible in the first place.”

According to Yankah, Trump’s essence is racist. For instance, when the President sees blacks protesting and he speaks out, it’s evidence that the President “cannot tolerate [that] the uppity do not stay in their place.”

But it’s more than Trump. It’s Trump’s supporters who have broken Yankah’s heart. (Though Yankah writes about white people, it should be noted almost 30 percent of Asians and Hispanics, and 8 percent of black people, voted for Trump. Also, millions of Obama voters pulled the lever for Trump.)

Yankah cannot excuse those who explain or apologize for what Trump says and does. The President’s designs are so obvious there can be no other interpretation.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Not that he doesn’t feel bad about it: “I do not write this with liberal condescension or glee. My heart is unbearably heavy when I assure you we cannot be friends.”

Heavy heart or not, this is a disastrous attitude, in politics or in friendship. When others disagree, you should first try to understand them, rather than simply condemn them. Certainly there’s a decent chance you don’t fully grasp what they’re saying. And maybe, just maybe, you’re the one who’s mistaken.

In trying to explain the violence earlier this year in Charlottesville, Yankah told his four-year-old “Some people hate others because they are different.” His son replied “But I’m not different.”

His son’s response gives me hope, a lot more than the counsel of despair that Yankah has to offer.

Because if the solution is to shutter friendships, where does that leave us?

No one is saying Yankah has to agree with Trump. A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump. But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally). He might discover they’re decent people.

He may even discover both Democrats and Republicans — all the way up to the president himself — want Americans of all races and ethnicities to do well.

Furthermore, maybe others will open up and understand him better, and the pain he feels when dealing with his children.

The country is having an argument right now, but it’s often not about the goal, but rather how to get there. And if you think the apologists for Trump are wrong, fine, try to explain to them why, rather than reading their minds and writing them off.

“If you happen to have an evil twin, you need to protect your data with a passcode,” marketing vice president Phil Schiller joked during Apple’s iPhone X announcement.

Well, it turns out you don’t need an evil twin because Apple’s Face ID can be hacked using a mask, according to IT security researchers at Bkav.

The researchers didn’t use any special software or hacks to bypass Face ID, instead using a 3D printed frame, makeup, a silicone nose and 2D images, along with special processing on the cheeks and around the face where there are large areas of skin.

The security experts said they were able to bypass the system because they had understood how Apple’s artificial intelligence worked.

“Everything went much more easily than you expect. You can try it out with your own iPhone X, the phone shall recognise you even when you cover a half of your face,” the hackers explained.

“It means the recognition mechanism is not as strict as you think, Apple seems to rely too much on Face ID’s AI. We just need a half face to create the mask. It was even simpler than we ourselves had thought.”

The researchers claim the entire mask used to trick Face ID cost less than $A200 to create.

“We used a popular 3D printer. Nose was made by a handmade artist. We use 2D printing for other parts (similar to how we tricked Face Recognition 9 years ago). The skin was also handmade to trick Apple’s AI,” they wrote.

In closing, the security experts had a scary warning for owners of the iPhone X.

The growing YOLO culture seeks to silence the stalwart dissent of facts.
The YOLO culture seeks not content of character, but equality of outcome.
The YOLO culture divides people against the each other.","The recent Texas church shooting, the terrorist driving a truck through a crowd in New York City, and the Las Vegas massacre may seem shocking – but to anyone who has been paying attention, they should not.

Our culture is undergoing a hostile takeover. American society used to be governed by Judeo-Christian do-unto-others morals. But we have drifted (been pushed, really) into a hedonistic YOLO (You Only Live Once) cultural morass. The upshot of this is a distinct lack of respect for human life in general, as well as a pervasive, insidious obsession with self.

This is the “me” generation, the “selfie” culture, the “entitlement” mentality. And what is entitlement, except the narcissistic assumption of deserving and demanding what is not earned?

Our cultural crisis is exhibited by egotistic multimillionaires demonstrating on football fields against the police instead of seeking solutions to rampant inner-city violence; coddled young people demanding free birth control and socialized health care; and even the major media ignoring the corruption trial of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

No amount of self-love can fill the God-shaped hole in someone’s heart. We are created and called to love each other, and no self-absorbed spa treatment or Instagram post can supplant our innate yearning for love from God.

Another example of the crisis is the lack of attention the mainstream media are paying to the Clintons’ collusion to sell Russia 20 percent of U.S. uranium.

We’ve replaced our moral imperative to do what’s right with a personal obsession of what’s in it for ME?

But no amount of self-love can fill the God-shaped hole in someone’s heart. We are created and called to love each other, and no self-absorbed spa treatment or Instagram post can supplant our innate yearning for love from God.

The spirit of our time is gradually revealing in our culture a subversive, resolute, and increasing hatred toward God and Christianity, and an irresistible temptation toward evil that betrays man’s innate desire for power: a longing to be God.

The Harvey Weinsteins of the world (and they are myriad, both in Hollywood and out) seek to force others to do their will, much like they envision a capricious God would be, if they believed in such a being.

It is much easier, however, to deny God than to acknowledge him. God, being good, condemns evil-doers. So, like a child throwing a tantrum in a toy store, some people must deny the existence of God and his inherent goodness, and lord their power over weaker people. “I can make you watch me shower.”

Society, still trading in our inherited moral capital, might verbally condemn the behavior. But that’s just lip-service, because we’ve succumbed to the YOLO moral relativism and forgotten our metric for right and wrong.

“I forbid you to see me as a sex object,” screamed the gal in the pink hat! And those who claim they wanted to expose the bully – and they all say that now – confess they were too afraid of retribution. Translation: I like my money and position more than I believe in right and wrong. “Followers” on social media beat morals every day of the week in YOLO land.

When a righteous dad wanted to expose a high-powered elitist climbing in bed with youngsters, the Hollywood leftists and atheists sided with the pedophile over the conservative. Status is more important than virtue in YOLO land.

The growing YOLO culture seeks to silence the stalwart dissent of facts. Feelings are more important than truth in YOLO land.

Threatened by disagreement and privilege, yelling triumphs over logic. The YOLO culture seeks not content of character, but equality of outcome. Hatred is so much easier than forgiveness.

Self-destructive loathing and jealousy stems from the hypocrisy that started in kindergarten, when children are taught: You are an accident of nature, and survival of the fittest is the law of the land. Now, don’t bully.

And so, they distrust the dark abyss of irreligion, even as they embrace it.

Attacks against the only one who preached forgiveness and grace, goodness and love – and any who support him – will increase: He challenges the YOLO worldview taught in public school.

As it becomes more and more costly to be an adherent of Christianity, with stories of the persecution of bakers, florists, teachers, and T-shirt makers splashing across newspapers every day, the truth gathers defenders.

Though meant to intimidate us, these stories do the opposite. They galvanize Christians to stand firm in the light of understanding, and the peace that surpasses it.

The people who still trade in the Judeo-Christian ethic of “love one another” and “life has value” are not called simply to defend their position, but to fight for it, before the overwhelming tide of YOLO selfishness inundates us with the intolerance and bigotry integral to the religion of self.

The YOLO culture divides people against the each other.

To survive and prosper as a nation, we must reaffirm our Judeo-Christian heritage, indivisible, under God. Because if you only live once, it’s survival of the fittest, and it’s all about you, then laws are meaningless.",Our culture is experiencing a hostile takeover.

“House of Cards,” goodbye and good riddance!","The next Kevin Spacey-less season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" will be the last. To those lamenting its end, I say good riddance.

I for one will not miss what I have come to view as one of the most anti-American phenomena in modern pop culture. With an upside-down American flag as its logo, and “Democracy Is So Overrated” as both its Facebook and Twitter themes — with 3 million likes and 2 million Twitter followers— our enemies couldn’t have designed a better way to undermine our democracy through entertainment and social media. There’s a reason that “House of Cards” is so popular in China and Russia: it paints a dark, dystopian picture of America. Is that what we really need right now?

I realize that I’m unusual. It seems everybody in Washington, D.C., watches “House of Cards.” But many in Washington came here from elsewhere, don’t stay long, and are proud of being “outsiders” in a town full of transients. I was born and raised here, and have been a lifelong resident of Our Nation’s Capital. My husband and I got married here, live and work here, raised our kids here. We don’t blackmail others, manipulate reporters, have an open marriage, make pacts to destroy colleagues’ careers, profanely insult underlings in business meetings, murder political rivals, create phony cyberattacks by foreign entities, or orchestrate fake terrorist attacks in order to stage coup d’etats. And no one else we know in Washington does, either.

“When Sergey Shoygu became Russia’s minister of defense in 2012, Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave him some interesting advice: If you want to understand America, he said, watch “House of Cards.”

The problem with “House of Cards” is it paints everyone in Washington with the same poison brush. I suspected it would bad for our brand from the start, but tuned in for the first season out of curiosity. I turned off the first episode after Frank Underwood killed a dog with his bare hands. After a year of persuading, friends talked me out of my boycott. I gritted my teeth through three more episodes, until Frank Underwood was in bed with a 20-something female reporter 30 years his junior, who was calling her dad to wish him a happy Father’s Day while the Congressman was ripping her clothes off. We have two twenty-something daughters. I was done.

Here’s how the creators themselves describe “House of Cards:” “This wicked political drama slithers beneath the curtain and through the back halls of greed, sex, love and corruption in modern Washington D.C.”

No wonder Chinese censors allowed “House of Cards” to continue its run for years — it depicts America as corrupt, sleazy, and weak. According to the New York Post, “When Sergey Shoygu became Russia’s minister of defense in 2012, Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave him some interesting advice: If you want to understand America, he said, watch “House of Cards.” In his book “All the Kremlin’s Men,” author Mikhail Zygar writes that “House of Cards” affirmed Putin’s belief “that Western politicians are all cynical scoundrels whose words about values and human rights are pure hot air and simply a tool to attack enemies.”

So much for being the beacon of democracy and freedom in the world. So much for winning the moral high ground over the twisted ideology of ISIS. Much better for Hollywood to have a wildly popular show that is “critically acclaimed” — seven Emmys and a whopping 53 Emmy nominations so far, but that’s another column for another day — and at the same time glorifies a president whose initials are “F.U.” Again, bad for the brand.

By its own account, Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 70 million members in over 190 countries watching more than 125 million hours of content a day. Maybe promoting a show that delights in bashing American democracy and trashing public service in front of that big a global audience is one reason why elected officials consistently rank below used car salesmen in public trust. It may be only one of many reasons, but “House of Cards” certainly isn’t helping to encourage good people to go into public service.

I worked for President George H.W. Bush, who said – in a quote that is engraved below his bust at the George H.W. Bush School of Public Service at Texas A&M University – “Public service is a noble calling and we need men and women of character to believe that they can make a difference in their communities, in their states and in their country.”

That’s why I went into public service, and I know a lot of other people – from both sides of the aisle – who did the same. Now that Frank Underwood is gone, maybe we’ll see more men and women of character believing they can make a difference, too. We need them.

Vice President Mike Pence “found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office,” his press secretary, Alyssa Farah, told reporters.

Here's how other lawmakers have responded to the allegations.

Sen. Mitch McConnell

While speaking to reporters on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he believes the women quoted in the Washington Post's story. He urged Moore to step aside in light of the allegations.

Previously, McConnell said Moore should step aside if ""these allegations are true.""

Sen. Cory Gardner

Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said Monday that he believes the women who have alleged Moore's misconduct. In a statement, he encouraged the Senate to ""vote to expel"" Moore should he win the election next month.

""He does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,"" Gardner, R-Colo., said.

Sen. Mike Lee

A former backer of Moore, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, pulled his endorsement from Moore after the allegations came to light.

""Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate,"" Lee said in a tweet.

He had also requested that Moore's campaign no longer use his image.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski

“I’m horrified and if it’s true, he should step down immediately,” Murkowski told reporters.

She reportedly also urged Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions’ seat when he was tapped to become attorney general, to launch a write-in campaign. The deadline to take Moore off the ballot has passed.

Sen. Mike Rounds

“If they are true, then he should seriously think about stepping aside,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.

Sen. John Cornyn

“I find it deeply distrusting and troubling. It’s up to the governor and the folks of Alabama to make that decision as far as what the next steps are,"" Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

Sen. Tim Scott

“If they’re accurate, he absolutely should [step aside],"" Tim Scott, of South Carolina, said.

Sen. Susan Collins

In a tweet on Monday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for Moore to ""withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama.""

Collins wrote that she listened to Moore deny the allegations in a recent radio interview, but ""did not find his denials to be convincing.""

Collins' most recent statement comes after she previously tweeted: ""If there is any truth at all to these horrific allegations, Roy Moore should immediately step aside as Senate candidate.""



Sen. Steve Daines

""These are very serious allegations and if true he should step down,"" said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.

Sen. John McCain

""The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said.

Sen. Richard Shelby

“It’s a devastating nasty story,” Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters. “If it’s true, I don’t believe there’d be a place for him in the U.S. Senate.”

Sen. Jeff Flake

Like other Republicans, Flake called on Moore to “step aside” from the election if the allegations are true.

He has also tweeted his call for Moore to “step aside immediately” and lambasted local Alabama GOP officials who defended Moore.

Sen. Luther Strange

Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who lost the special election primary to Roy Moore, called the allegations “disturbing.”

He has not yet said if he’ll reenter the race, but told the Associated Press that he is doing “research.” It is too late to take Moore off the ballot, but Strange has been encouraged to launch a write-in campaign.

Sen. Rob Portman

“I think if what we read is true, and people are on the record so I assume it is, then he should step aside,” Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said.

Sen. Ben Sasse

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called the Washington Post’s story ""heartbreaking.""

The senator also agreed on Twitter with National Review editor Jonah Goldberg who said, “As the father of a 14 year old girl, this ‘What’s the big deal?’ crap enrages me.”

Sen. Ted Cruz

""These are serious and troubling allegations,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who previously endorsed Moore, said in a statement. ""If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw. However, we need to know the truth, and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., officially withdrew his support from the candidate on Saturday.

""Based on the allegations against Roy Moore, his reponse and what is known, I withdraw support,"" he said.

Sen. Orrin Hatch

""I stand with the Majority Leader on this. These are serious and disturbing accusations, and while the decision is now in the hands of the people of Alabama, I believe Luther Strange is an excellent alternative,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, tweeted Monday.

Sen. Pat Toomey

“We'll probably never know for sure exactly what happened,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday.

""But … I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial. I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.”

Rep. Paul Ryan

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement that if the allegations are true, they would disqualify Moore from the special election in December.

“These allegations are disqualifying if true. Anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office, let alone the United States Senate,” Ryan said in a statement.

Rep. Peter King

""I would say unless he can prove his innocence, the burden is now on him within the next day or so, I believe he has to step down. He owes it to himself, he owes it to the state and and he owes it to the U.S. Senate,"" New York Rep. Peter King said on MSNBC.

Gov. John Kasich

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Twitter that he’s “long opposed” Moore and called on him to step aside from the race as well.

“I’ve long opposed Roy Moore [and] his divisive viewpoints. The actions described make him unfit for office. The GOP must not support him. He should step aside,” Kasich said.

Former Gov. Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, slammed Moore on Twitter.

“Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman,” the former governor said. “Her account is too serous to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.”

Former Gov. Jeb Bush

On Monday, former Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Moore should step down in light of the allegations.

""This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding; this is a question of what’s right and what’s wrong. Acknowledging that you’re dating teenagers when you’re 32 years old as assistant state attorney is wrong. It’s just plain wrong,"" he told CNBC, adding that he agreed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said earlier Monday that Moore should ""step aside.""

""We need to stand for basic principles, and decency has to be one of those,"" Bush added. ""In the really poisonous political environment we have right now, one of the rules I think has to apply is that when you attack somebody on the other party, and the other team for doing something wrong, when it happens on your team, you have an obligation I think to speak out as well.""

One of the few upsides to the kneeling controversy engulfing the NFL is that it’s reinforced the notion that there are few things in this country more sacred than the lives of our military men and women. Public support for and confidence in the military remains astronomically high, buoyed by the enormous respect most Americans have for those who serve in uniform.

Why, then, do we continue to look away from one of the most disturbing catastrophes befalling our military heroes? It’s estimated that about 22 veterans die from suicide per day. That’s nearly one per hour, a rate far above the average among the general public. The physical, emotional and spiritual brokenness giving rise to the suicide epidemic is destroying lives, families and tearing at the public institution we honor most.

But fear is not of God,"" said DiNardo, in an address to the bishops' fall meeting in Baltimore.

Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, Texas, affirmed the government's authority to protect national security. But he said recent policies and attitudes have often been rooted in unfounded anxiety about people who ""look, talk and even think differently."" That fear is present both within and outside the church, he said.

""The forces of division prey on our fear of the unfamiliar, the different. But fear is not of God,"" said DiNardo, in an address to the bishops' fall meeting in Baltimore. ""They tempt us to see a threat in the stranger.""

DiNardo never mentioned President Donald Trump by name, focusing instead on government policy. DiNardo said the country had a ""moral responsibility"" to protect the border ""in a humane way."" He said a ""pro-life immigration policy is one that does not tear families apart."" And he expressed support for young immigrants known by their advocates as Dreamers. For ""those who have only known the United States as their home, we make Pope Francis' words our own: keep on dreaming,"" DiNardo said.

Trump has said an aggressive deportation policy and restrictions on refugee entry to the U.S. are critical for national security. His administration has decided to phase out temporary deportation protections enacted under former President Barack Obama for a number of those young people brought to the country illegally as children, giving Congress until March to come up with a new policy. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families that overstayed visas.

The bishops' assembly opened with a Sunday night Mass celebrated by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the conference. In his sermon, Parolin urged the bishops to dispel ""the shadows of polarization, divisiveness and societal breakdown by the pure light of the Gospel.""

The Vatican provided no information about Parolin's trip in the U.S. On Monday, he met with Vice President Mike Pence, according to a White House news release, which said the men discussed issues including religious freedom, human trafficking and the plight of Christian and other religious minorities in Iraq and Syria. Parolin told the Catholic TV network EWTN that he and Pence also discussed the church's position on the need for a ""compassionate approach to the issue of migration."" The White House news release did not mention immigration.

The 68-million-member U.S. Catholic church, the country's largest denomination by far, runs a nationwide network of support programs for refugees and immigrants. Immigrants comprise a large share of church members, including a growing presence of Latinos, both newcomers and U.S.-born parishioners. Pope Francis has made aid for immigrants and refugees a priority of his pontificate.

DiNardo linked the church's advocacy for immigrants with the Roman Catholic teaching against abortion, saying respect for others begins in the womb. He also called for stronger religious liberty protections for health care workers and others who oppose abortion.

Several bishops said the precarious situation for immigrants was the result of inaction by several presidential administrations that did not enact comprehensive immigration reform. Still, church leaders noted that animosity toward immigrants has intensified over the past year or so.

Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich said ""that poisoning rhetoric"" is having an impact on parishioners. Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski, referencing the Trump campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" said, ""We can make America great, but you don't make America great by making America mean.""

Along with advocating for immigrants, the bishops have started a new initiative against racism, which has had a ""troubling resurgence,"" said Bishop George Murry, of Youngston, Ohio.","Catholic cardinal condemns ""forces of division"" and fear",https://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/13/catholic-cardinal-condemns-forces-division-and-fear.html

European Union figures show that Poland's birth rate was 1.32 children per woman in 2015. Only Portugal had a lower fertility rate, though the figures in Spain and Greece were almost as low as Poland.

The Health Ministry said in a statement to The Associated Press that it was trying to encourage Poles in their reproductive years — between the ages of 18 and 45 — to adopt a healthy lifestyle that would improve their reproductive health.

It also said it was seeking to raise public awareness of the issue in a way that ""did not offend anyone and was not vulgar.""","Amid low birth rates, Polish government asks citizens to multiply like rabbits",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/08/amid-low-birth-rates-polish-government-asks-citizens-to-multiply-like-rabbits.html

(Chevy's sorry not sorry about that.)","The 2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 isn’t just the most powerful Corvette yet, but the most powerful General Motors car ever made.

The new “King of the Hill” has a 755 hp 6.2-liter V8 sticking out of its hood, thanks to a supercharger that’s over 50 percent larger than the one used by the now relatively weak-kneed 650 hp Corvette Z06.

Consider for a moment that is also 300 hp more than the base Corvette Stingray and you realize this car means the business. The engine is fitted with port and direct fuel injection and also sends 715 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels through a standard 7-speed manual, or optional 8-speed automatic transmission.

Chevy hasn’t revealed how quick it is, but says the ZR1 will break the 210 mph barrier, which could put it within range of the $450,000 2016 mph Ford GT.

That’s if you order it with the Low Wing aerodynamic package, which was designed to create tremendous downforce with little drag. An enormous High Wing is also available that’s adjustable and can plant the 14-inch wide rear tires to the ground with up to 950 pounds of pressure.

It can do that because it's mounted to the chassis aft of the hatchback opening for strength, which presents the downside of making you lift your groceries up and over the wing to get them in the trunk. (Chevy's sorry not sorry about that.)

An underbody front wing helps to balance out the handling and leaves plenty of space above it for three air intakes that help feed some of the baker’s dozen of heat exchangers needed to keep the ZR1’s components cool.

The car is undeniably cool, even when it’s parked, but will surely look even better when it hits the street and track next spring at a price that hasn’t been announced, but will likely be north of the $112,000 the last ZR1 went for in 2012.

To infiltrate the school, the EPFL team identified characteristics that real fish use to distinguish themselves and designed the robot accordingly.
Taking the project one step further, the researchers designed the robot to learn and adapt from the behavior of the real fish.
“In somes studies, we compared groups composed of only fish with groups composed of fish and robots,” Bonnet said.
“We could show that the two are behaving similarly, which shows that the robots are able to act like fish, and integrate groups of fish.","Robots may be getting more realistic but most of us can still discern a human from a humanoid. Fish, on the other hand, seem easier to fool.

Researchers at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland have developed an aquatic robot that can infiltrate schools of zebrafish, going so far as to influence their activities. By designing robots to integrate with animal communities, the roboticists hope to unravel these animals’ behavioral and social structures by learning more about how they communicate.

“We wanted to study how a robotic agent can be inserted in a fish shoal, and, when inserted, how this robotic agent could learn how the fish interact, communicate, and take decisions,” Frank Bonnet, an EPFL postdoctoral researcher who worked on the project, told Digital Trends.

The robot has two parts — a magnetic fish and a motor, which is positioned underneath the aquarium and helps propel the robot through the water.

To infiltrate the school, the EPFL team identified characteristics that real fish use to distinguish themselves and designed the robot accordingly. These included physical traits (such as shape, color, and markings) and behavioral traits (including acceleration speeds, size of schools, and how the fish move their tails in transit). Taking the project one step further, the researchers designed the robot to learn and adapt from the behavior of the real fish.

“In somes studies, we compared groups composed of only fish with groups composed of fish and robots,” Bonnet said. “We could show that the two are behaving similarly, which shows that the robots are able to act like fish, and integrate groups of fish. We also used other setups, such as a ring-shaped setup, to show that the robotic agents can influence on the swimming direction preference of the fish.”

EPFL researchers have previously done similar work on cockroach communities, which are willing to accept practically anything that emits specific cockroach pheromones. Fish posed a much more difficult task, but Bonnet already sees how the work will shed light on the nuances of their societies.

“We could already learn which features are relevant for the fish for social integration,” he said. “We can also learn the hierarchy in fish societies, if for instance there are some leaders, and what are the important aspects to become a leader in fish groups, and how the fish are collectively taking decisions.”

""Based on the allegations against Roy Moore, his reponse and what is known, I withdraw support,"" he said.","National Republican leaders have pulled their support for Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate candidate, in the wake of allegations claiming he had inappropriate sexual contact with teenage girls.

The Washington Post reported last week that four women accused Moore of initiating sexual contact with them in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was an assistant district attorney in his early 30s. One of the women, Leigh Corfman, told the newspaper that Moore had sexual contact with her when she was just 14.

The age of consent in Alabama is 16.

Moore has denied the allegations, saying in a statement obtained by Fox News on Friday that the article was ""based on a lie supported by innuendo.""

""It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough. So let me be clear. I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,"" he said.

Still, multiple Republicans have called on Moore to step aside from the special election in December. And the National Republican Senatorial Committee reportedly severed its fundraising ties with Moore.

The White House

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said if the allegations are true, President Trump believes that ""Moore will do the right thing and step aside.""

“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,"" Sanders said. ""However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.""

Trump deflected questions about the allegations when asked by reporters during his trip to Asia.

Vice President Mike Pence “found the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office,” his press secretary, Alyssa Farah, told reporters.

Here's how other lawmakers have responded to the allegations.

Sen. Mitch McConnell

While speaking to reporters on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he believes the women quoted in the Washington Post's story. He urged Moore to step aside in light of the allegations.

Previously, McConnell said Moore should step aside if ""these allegations are true.""

Sen. Cory Gardner

Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said Monday that he believes the women who have alleged Moore's misconduct. In a statement, he encouraged the Senate to ""vote to expel"" Moore should he win the election next month.

""He does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,"" Gardner, R-Colo., said.

Sen. Mike Lee

A former backer of Moore, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, pulled his endorsement from Moore after the allegations came to light.

""Having read the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign, I can no longer endorse his candidacy for the US Senate,"" Lee said in a tweet.

He had also requested that Moore's campaign no longer use his image.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski

“I’m horrified and if it’s true, he should step down immediately,” Murkowski told reporters.

She reportedly also urged Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill Jeff Sessions’ seat when he was tapped to become attorney general, to launch a write-in campaign. The deadline to take Moore off the ballot has passed.

Sen. Mike Rounds

“If they are true, then he should seriously think about stepping aside,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.

Sen. John Cornyn

“I find it deeply distrusting and troubling. It’s up to the governor and the folks of Alabama to make that decision as far as what the next steps are,"" Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.

Sen. Tim Scott

“If they’re accurate, he absolutely should [step aside],"" Tim Scott, of South Carolina, said.

Sen. Susan Collins

In a tweet on Monday, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for Moore to ""withdraw from the Senate race in Alabama.""

Collins wrote that she listened to Moore deny the allegations in a recent radio interview, but ""did not find his denials to be convincing.""

Collins' most recent statement comes after she previously tweeted: ""If there is any truth at all to these horrific allegations, Roy Moore should immediately step aside as Senate candidate.""



Sen. Steve Daines

""These are very serious allegations and if true he should step down,"" said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.

Sen. John McCain

""The allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said.

Sen. Richard Shelby

“It’s a devastating nasty story,” Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters. “If it’s true, I don’t believe there’d be a place for him in the U.S. Senate.”

Sen. Jeff Flake

Like other Republicans, Flake called on Moore to “step aside” from the election if the allegations are true.

He has also tweeted his call for Moore to “step aside immediately” and lambasted local Alabama GOP officials who defended Moore.

Sen. Luther Strange

Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who lost the special election primary to Roy Moore, called the allegations “disturbing.”

He has not yet said if he’ll reenter the race, but told the Associated Press that he is doing “research.” It is too late to take Moore off the ballot, but Strange has been encouraged to launch a write-in campaign.

Sen. Rob Portman

“I think if what we read is true, and people are on the record so I assume it is, then he should step aside,” Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said.

Sen. Ben Sasse

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., called the Washington Post’s story ""heartbreaking.""

The senator also agreed on Twitter with National Review editor Jonah Goldberg who said, “As the father of a 14 year old girl, this ‘What’s the big deal?’ crap enrages me.”

Sen. Ted Cruz

""These are serious and troubling allegations,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who previously endorsed Moore, said in a statement. ""If they are true, Judge Moore should immediately withdraw. However, we need to know the truth, and Judge Moore has the right to respond to these accusations.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., officially withdrew his support from the candidate on Saturday.

""Based on the allegations against Roy Moore, his reponse and what is known, I withdraw support,"" he said.

Sen. Orrin Hatch

""I stand with the Majority Leader on this. These are serious and disturbing accusations, and while the decision is now in the hands of the people of Alabama, I believe Luther Strange is an excellent alternative,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, tweeted Monday.

Sen. Pat Toomey

“We'll probably never know for sure exactly what happened,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday.

""But … I think the accusations have more credibility than the denial. I think it would be best if Roy would just step aside.”

Rep. Paul Ryan

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement that if the allegations are true, they would disqualify Moore from the special election in December.

“These allegations are disqualifying if true. Anyone who would do this to a child has no place in public office, let alone the United States Senate,” Ryan said in a statement.

Rep. Peter King

""I would say unless he can prove his innocence, the burden is now on him within the next day or so, I believe he has to step down. He owes it to himself, he owes it to the state and and he owes it to the U.S. Senate,"" New York Rep. Peter King said on MSNBC.

Gov. John Kasich

Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Twitter that he’s “long opposed” Moore and called on him to step aside from the race as well.

“I’ve long opposed Roy Moore [and] his divisive viewpoints. The actions described make him unfit for office. The GOP must not support him. He should step aside,” Kasich said.

Former Gov. Mitt Romney

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, slammed Moore on Twitter.

“Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman,” the former governor said. “Her account is too serous to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.”

Former Gov. Jeb Bush

On Monday, former Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Moore should step down in light of the allegations.

""This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding; this is a question of what’s right and what’s wrong. Acknowledging that you’re dating teenagers when you’re 32 years old as assistant state attorney is wrong. It’s just plain wrong,"" he told CNBC, adding that he agreed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said earlier Monday that Moore should ""step aside.""

""We need to stand for basic principles, and decency has to be one of those,"" Bush added. ""In the really poisonous political environment we have right now, one of the rules I think has to apply is that when you attack somebody on the other party, and the other team for doing something wrong, when it happens on your team, you have an obligation I think to speak out as well.""

Listen here for the full interview

BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Welcome back, everyone. Brian Kilmeade here. Thanks so much for listening to the Brian Kilmeade show. In a little while, we're going to have Bill Hammer on. Yes, that same Bill Hammer. But first things first, there's only very few people in this world I break format for and give up the big three, and one of them is on the line. He is Speaker Paul Ryan. Mr. Speaker, welcome.

SEN. PAUL RYAN, R-WIS., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Hey, thanks for breaking format. How are you doing, man?

KILMEADE: Anything for you. Now, what time were you up working out today?

RYAN: Six.

KILMEADE: Six o'clock.

RYAN: Yes.

KILMEADE: Knowing that you had a lot to do, is it harder to work out knowing that you had a lot to do?

RYAN: No, it makes it easier actually. It just helps me get on my day. My mind's a little distracted, but working out's the best way to just process stress to me.

KILMEADE: Process stress. That's what I want to bring up to you. A lot of people on either side of the aisle, the republicans are saying last night was no big deal when the marquee matchup was at Gillespie against Northam, and that Gillespie lost by nine. And democrats are saying this is ""the beginning of our turnaround."" What do you take from Ed Gillespie's significant loss yesterday?

RYAN: Well, obviously democrats are going to do that, and we would be saying the same kind of thing. That's the way the spin works on these things. The way I see it, honestly, is we've got to get our job done, and we've got to - that's why I think tax reform is just so important. Not just politically, but just for the country.

And I think what people want to know and see is that this Donald Trump presidency and this republican Congress makes a positive difference in my life. And granted in the House we feel pretty good because we've actually been passing this agenda left and right. We've passed 394 bills out of the House alone, more in this presidency than in Obama, Clinton, and Bush's at the same time. It's just that about 308 of those bills still haven't gotten into the law. They're still kind of over in the Senate, so we're a little gummed up and frustrated there, but that's why tax reform is so important --

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- because tax reform is one of those things. Those 308 bills I mentioned, those all can be filibustered.

KILMEADE: You talk --

RYAN: Tax reform --

KILMEADE: Right. Well --

RYAN: -- cannot be filibustered.

KILMEADE: -- Mr. Speaker, you know - you just said that's the way politics is. People spin their way out of it. Do you have to make (ph) as republicans -- either you're going to side with President Bush and his policies - 43 or more, free trade, and maybe some type of immigration compromise - or do you have to go with Donald Trump? Is it going to be a choice for republicans - Bush or Trump?

RYAN: We already made that choice. We're with Trump. We already made that choice. That's a choice we made at the beginning of the year. That's a choice we made during the campaign which is we merged our agendas. We ran on a joint agenda with Donald Trump. We got together with Donald Trump when he was President Elect Trump and walked through what is it we want to accomplish in the next two years. We all agreed on that agenda. We're processing that agenda.

Again, in the House, we passed, repeal, and replaced Obamacare. We funded the wall already in the House. We passed rebuilding the military. Once we're on the second installment there, we pass out veterans over all those. We pass, repeal, and replace of Dodd-Frank.

Now, not everything I just said is going into law because, again, if Chuck Schumer gets to filibuster these things in the Senate, that frustrates everybody. But that's my point, Brian. Tax reform is the most singular, signature issue that people think of when they think of republican, when they think of Donald Trump, when they think of how is this going to help me in my life.

An average $1,200 tax cut for the average household in America...

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- where you got half the country living paycheck to paycheck is a big deal. Dropping the tax rates on businesses by 40 percent so they can compete globally and hire more people is a big deal. When you see statistics like the corporate rate reduction loan increases wages like $4,000, it's a big deal. When you see an analysis that just came up that says this tax reform bill will increase jobs by a million jobs, increase economic growth, take home pay and wage growth, that's a big deal. So we got to deliver. And that's what I get out of this, is we got to deliver, we're in the middle of doing it.

The committee's putting the bill through the committee this week, the floor next week, the Senate's following one week behind us. So we just got to deliver, that's what I get out of this.

KILMEADE: And Mr. Speaker, as you know, you got to keep one eye on the Senate, because you're about passing, you're not just about committee and mark ups.

RYAN: Right. Right.

KILMEADE: So you saw what came out yesterday. Evidently, Orrin Hatch's committee is putting out a policy that's backed by Senator Portman that possibly would delay the corporate tax until 2019. So you'll get it to 20 -- would you wait a year for the corporate tax reduction?

RYAN: Yes, I mean this is a long process. The House is going to it's thing, the Senate's going to do it's thing, then we're going to go meet in what we call a conference committee and iron out those differences. Right now, the House bill -- I can't speak for the Senate -- we're immediate and we're permanent.

The -- what Rob Portman will probably tell you is phasing in the corporate reduction still is very good for economic growth, because you have full expensing. And that means it's actually more valuable for a company to expand their operations immediately with a phase in, because they can deduct it off a higher tax rate.

And businesses do multi-year planning. So what economists tell us -- and this is what I think Senator Portman would say -- is that you still get very fast economic growth and you actually are encouraging companies to spend on factories and plants and equipment and hiring people sooner with the phase in.

So I still think you get the faster economic growth. So I'm not trying to come up with excuses, all I'm saying is the Senate is still focused on getting an economic growth plan and the House does it as well. So at the end of the day, this is all to the good, it's just a debate about how good it gets.

KILMEADE: So the Wall Street Journal, who doesn't wake up every day thinking how am I going to mess with the GOP, I just don't like those guys, maybe like Salon or the Huffington Post does, has a little bit of a problem. And they also point out the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is normally supportive of your efforts to overhaul the tax system, said that there's a lot of work to be done here.

And the Chairman of the National Association of Home Builders has a problem on the cap on $500,000 to be able to write off your mortgage. He says that really hurts people in high tax states.

RYAN: Well look, for even people with (ph) the high tax states, here's what this bill does. It's -- you still get to write off the first $500,000 of your mortgage, you get an additional -- we had to back a property tax deduction, oh, and don't forget the fact you just got a doubled standard deduction, so your first $24,000 instead of your first $12,000 are tax free.

If you have kids, you just increased your child tax credit by $600 per child. And we're lowering tax rates across the board. The people above a million don't get a rate lowering, but their income -- most -- more of their income is -- is taxed at lower rates. So actually, even though there's a lot of counter -- false information out there, everybody gets a tax cut.

Everybody's rates go down, everybody's exemption goes up. So the difference here with these kinds of deductions is this.

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: Do you -- do we just cut tax rates and let you keep your money and you decide what to do with it? Or do we keep tax rates higher, you send your money to Washington, and then if you do something that the IRS approves of, you know a mortgage or something like that, then you can get you some of your money back.

Our philosophy is just cut tax rates across the board so you deduct less but you keep your money first. And you decide what you want to do with your money because it's your money. That's the philosophical difference here.

KILMEADE: So the one thing is you do not cut the top rate for those who -- for the upper class and you leave it at 39.6 percent.

RYAN: Right.

KILMEADE: If you get rid of the deductions and leave that, you'd actually up the taxes on the most successful people in the country, which a lot of people don't despise or resent.

RYAN: No. I'd say -- but one more thing you're forgetting in that, which is we're taking the -- the -- the dollar amount that that rate hits, from $477,000 up to $1 million. So that means another half a million dollars are taxed at a lower rate than they would be under our current law.

KILMEADE: What would that new rate be? So if the high - if the --

RYAN: Well it's 39.6. But it's just - I'm saying 39.6 kicks in at a million instead of $477,000, and 35 percent would be the rate you're at for 477 to a million. The point being even people in the Joint Committee in Taxation that runs the numbers for - official number for Congress say everybody gets a tax cut. Everyone gets a tax cut.

Now what I would simply say is the president made really clear to us that he wants the tax relief on the endikem (ph) tax side to be focused on middle income people. He doesn't want massive tax relief on top.

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: He wants massive tax relief in the middle and for low income people. That was what the president basically said to Congress to do, that Congress followed suit and did that, but also the people who own businesses are the people you're describing. Businesses are getting their tax rates dropped tremendously. Successful small businesses, their top tax rate goes from over 40 percent down to 25 percent -- KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- a proper rate (ph) from 35 percent to 20 percent, the debt tax being repealed. So I would say that most of those folks that you're talking about are owner of businesses. They're getting a big business tax cut, so everyone's going to benefit from this, and that's why we're seeing these estimates that show --

KILMEADE: Right.

RYAN: -- more jobs, higher wages, faster economic growth.

KILMEADE: So, Mr. Speaker, two more quick things - I'm getting a lot of people who are I would label as working class say to me, ""I cannot believe they're going to get rid of the tax credit for adoptive parents --

RYAN: Yes.

KILMEADE: -- we needed that money. That's why I - that's one of the --

RYAN: Sure.

KILMEADE: -- great things about adopting,"" which is a great thing to do. Anyway, why would you attacked that?

RYAN: I was one of the authors of the tax credit. We obviously are for that. It's a tax credit that is enjoyed by higher income people, not lower income people. You don't get a tax credit, for instance, if you're getting -taking fosters kids. You actually get a different arrangement there. It was - the question the Ways of Mean Committee asked was, ""do we want to give a person one tax cut for one year for doing one thing, or do we want to give families a tax cut every year for anything?""

And that's the difference here which is do you get one tax cut for adopting a child once, or do we give families a tax cut each and every year for each and every child always, and then let them decide what they want to do with their money. That's the difference here.

KILMEADE: All right. He's getting his hands dirty defending a tax point that hasn't quite take total shape knowing that the democrats are coming out with a plan of their own, and their going to get their hands dirty again. You still act optimistic to get this done by Thanksgiving?

RYAN: Yes, in the House. The plan was always the House out by Thanksgiving, the Senate's going to be about a week behind us because the rule is required the House go first, and the goal here is law by the end of the year, and we're on track.

KILMEADE: Thanks so much, Mr. Speaker. I'll see you in Washington. Hopefully we'll do a longer version of this.

Disneyland last week shut down two water-cooling towers after some visitors to the Anaheim, Calif., theme park contracted Legionnaires’ disease.

A dozen cases of the bacterial lung infection were discovered about three weeks ago, the Orange County Health Care Agency said Friday.

The patients, ranging in age from 52 to 94, lived or had spent time in Anaheim, and nine had visited Disneyland in September. One patient, who hadn’t visited the park, has died, the agency said.

There haven’t been any new cases linked to Anaheim since September, the agency said.

“There is no known ongoing risk associated with this outbreak,” the agency said.

Legionnaires’ disease can be spread through inhaling droplets from contaminated water sources. While many people have no symptoms, it can cause serious pneumonia and prove dangerous to those with lung or immune system problems.

The disease can be treated with antibiotics.

Disneyland was informed of the Anaheim cases Oct. 27 and after testing found that two cooling towers had elevated levels of Legionella bacteria. The towers were taken out of service Nov. 1, disinfected, went back in operation Nov. 5 but were shut down again Tuesday and will remain offline until tests confirm they are free from contamination, according to the park and the county health agency.

Cooling towers are evaporative systems that provide cooled water for various uses such as refrigeration but not for drinking water. The towers are not in public areas.

Disney operates a total of 18 cooling towers across its Anaheim parks, the Orange County Register reported. None of the other 16 towers had high levels of Legionella bacteria, the report said.

Orange County has had more than 55 reported cases of Legionnaires’ disease this year and the number of cases has increased in recent years both in the county and nationally, according to the health care agency.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 6,000 cases of the disease were reported nationwide in 2015, the Orange County Register reported.

The television plays a crucial part in our day-to-day lives, so it’s important to keep its placement in mind when planning out a room. Given the shape and massive size of today’s TVs, the big screen has become a massive eyesore without many places to go other than smack dab in the center of a wall. If this is sounds familiar, get ready to get inspired by these three inventive tricks to hide your TV in plain sight.

1. Camouflage it with a black wall. One lone rectangular block of black in a room can create a striking feature that is unfavorable in many designs. By extending the dark hue across a bigger space, you can create a fun accent wall and play down the glaring, shiny black electronic screen. All it requires is a bucket of paint from your local hardware store and a little know-how on basic painting techniques.

If a full black wall is too bold for your design taste, painting just the horizontal strip of the wall that the TV occupies is a nice compromise. Then, you can balance the room with black home decor pieces. Keep it minimal with a black-and-white palette or add some color to lighten the look.

2. Pair it alongside other appliances. If you’re faced with the scenario of having two or more gaping black holes in your room, the best solution may be to simply combine them as an intentional arrangement instead of an odd-one-out situation. For example, you can juxtapose a fireplace with a TV above the mantel. Get a gallery look by hanging similarly-sized pieces, such as a cabinet or oversized artwork. Alternatively, if you enjoy watching television in the kitchen while you prepare or eat dinner, nestle it in with other appliances, such as an oven or wine fridge.

Be sure to take some safety measures when displaying electronics above appliances. Protect your TV from rising heat by mounting it above a mantel or enclosing it in a well-ventilated cabinet. Also make sure the television is still at a comfortable viewing angle to reduce neck strain or consider investing in a flexible wall mount.

3. Invest in built-ins. This is a more customized approach to hiding a TV. Sliding doors, swiveling panels and folding cabinets are carefully measured to the device for a sleek disguise. One of the simpler strategies is to cover the TV with sliding doors that can be matched to the rest of your wall or stand out as an interesting focal point. Other popular ideas include a snug art panel that slides to reveal or conceal a TV. Or if you’d rather opt for a cabinet enclosure, you can conceal additional media components, like speakers or game consoles. Although these options are more expensive and time-consuming, they will completely conceal your TV from view. Do your research and consult an experienced cabinetmaker, electrician or media professional to make the job more manageable.",3 strategies for disguising your TV in plain sight,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/03/3-strategies-for-disguising-your-tv-in-plain-sight.html

A while after celebrating their nuptials on Oct. 14 in Hillsboro, Ky., Jason told Yahoo Lifestyle that the song has special meaning for the high school sweethearts.

“Allison comes from a place where she used to be in an abusive relationship, and to know that someone like me could change that for her is absolutely extraordinary,” he said.

FATHER'S DYING WISH TO WALK DAUGHTERS DOWN THE AISLE COMES TRUE

While both Dyer and Thurgood are only 18 years old, they’ve been dating for four years since meeting in church. Further, they consider themselves devoted to both their faith and their relationship.

“I didn’t want a relationship [when we met], but I knew God was telling me he was the one, so I took a leap of faith,” Allison told the site.

In hopes of adding a personal touch to the ceremony, she decided to surprise her new husband with the musical interlude. The added touch was deeply personal, as the couple often travels to perform at other churches.

“People call and ask for her to sing, and I’m usually the one behind her,” Jason said.

While the groom remembered that Allison showed him a YouTube clip of another girl singing a similar Elvis cover a year ago, he was totally surprised by her serenade, especially since his best man acted as the sound guy for the ceremony. The bride did, however, tease him with a cryptic message beforehand.

“I told him that if he didn’t cry, I was going to turn around and do it all over again,” Allison said, adding that Jason’s emotional reaction is her favorite part of the video.

On the big day, as Presley’s heartfelt tune wafted through the venue, Jason said he was totally shocked to see his bride-to-be slowly coming towards him in song.

“I saw the mic in her hand, and she was singing, and at that moment, the floodgates opened up. It was a complete surprise. I was really flattered,” he said.

Or maybe you don't, but you'd rather use your day off to catch up on precious sleep than spend eight hours (or, hey, three days) in the kitchen. Maybe you hadn't planned on hosting Thanksgiving dinner at all, but all of the sudden, you have to. Or maybe you've planned on hosting Thanksgiving all along, but haven't had a chance to figure out your menu in advance.

Whatever your reasons are for needing a Thanksgiving menu you can pull off in just three hours, I'm here for you, with the menu you need, plus the shopping list and the timed game-plan you need to pull it off as smoothly as possible.

But just because this is a last-minute Thanksgiving plan doesn't mean it's not festive and fresh and modern and delicious. In fact, it even has a bit of an Italian flare going on. The menu feeds eight, but it'd be pretty easy to cut it all in half to feed four if you've got a smaller crowd. And did I mention that you only need to spend three hours in the kitchen to make it happen?

Roast that turkey in pieces.

Cutting a turkey in pieces (two bone-in breast pieces and two whole legs) before roasting not only helps it cook faster, it also makes it easy to add more flavor and moisture without brining. I love to brush a flavor-packed melted butter under and over the skin, and then nestle the pieces on a baking sheet and pour some wine around. Cover it with foil, then roast it for 20 minutes to keep all the moisture and flavor trapped inside, then uncover it for the final cooking to get that nicely crisped skin. Bonus: The pan juices are your shortcut to a flavorful sauce that's a faster and easier answer to gravy.

If you can, buy two whole turkey legs and two split bone-in turkey breasts. Or have your butcher break down a 10–12-pound bird for you and reserve the backbone and wings for another use. If you can't do either of those things, just buy a whole 10–12 pound bird and break it down yourself — the method is the same one you'd use to cut up chicken, and will only take you 10 or 15 minutes to do at the most.

Serve kale salad, which everyone is already obsessed with

I always serve salad at Thanksgiving. You need something bright and fresh and green to balance out the meal, but there's another reason to make one of your sides a fresh salad: no oven or stovetop space needed. And it's fast. For this menu, I use a kale and Brussels sprout recipe that's been popular on epicurious for a long time (hello 274 four-fork reviews!) that fits well with the sort-of-Italian flavor profile of the whole meal. It takes 20 minutes to prep — to make it even faster, use your food processor's slicing disc to cut the Brussels sprouts for you.

Roast some gorgeous squash and sunny sweet potatoes

To cover both the sweet potato and winter squash categories of customary Thanksgiving sides, I roast a whole bunch of sweet potatoes and Delicata squash, cut into aesthetically pleasing circles. And yes, I like to serve it on a circular platter to highlight the circle theme. I add fresh thyme sprigs (no time for pickin' leaves here!) and red-pepper flakes to the veg before roasting.

To finish the dish, I make a gorgeous cranberry agrodolce (a fancy Italian term for sweet and sour dishes — including sauces) from tart cranberries, red-wine vinegar, and sugar. The bright-red sauce is gorgeous drizzled over all those orange circles, but it's also just the thing to balance out the natural sweetness of the roasted squash and sweet potatoes. I make enough to use it as a condiment for the turkey, too. In fact this might be how I make cranberry sauce forevermore.

Make a skillet stuffing

You can't have Thanksgiving without stuffing (or dressing, rather) but you don't have time for a complicated recipe, do you? So I created a stuffing that you can bake in the same pan you used to sauté the stuffing flavorings. There are lots of wild mushrooms because mushrooms in stuffing are the best, and spicy Italian sausage and some fresh sage for extra flavor. There's white wine in here too, just like in the turkey, and grated cheese to make it richer and more flavorful (and because we're already using pecorino in the salad, so why not?). It takes about 20 minutes to assemble and another 20 to bake, and everyone who has tried it so far has asked for seconds.

Frozen puff pastry is your secret weapon for dessert

Alas, there's no time for homemade pie on a three-hour Thanksgiving menu. Someone else is welcome to bring one, of course, but I suggest you follow my teammate Rhoda Boone's easy recipe for a maple-pear sheet tart, which only requires 10 minutes of prep time. Just pop it in the oven right before you sit down to dinner, and it'll be freshly baked in time for dessert. I like to serve it with vanilla ice cream to make dessert a little more substantial. And I pour some Italian amaro to drink after it, because we've been flirting with Italy all night, and because it helps the digestion, right?

But in an interview with shock jock Howard Stern recorded just weeks ago, Takei appeared to admit that he had grabbed and groped people in the past, saying he did it to “persuade” people who were “afraid” to have a sexual encounter with him.

Former model Scott R. Brunton claimed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he was 23 when he exchanged phone numbers with Takei at a bar, later visiting the actor’s house for drinks.

He said he grew dizzy and “must have passed out,” waking to his pants around his ankles and Takei groping him. He said he extricated himself and left.

“Right now it is a he said/he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful,” Takei tweeted in response to the allegations.

The ""Star Trek"" star makes regular appearances on radio heavyweight Stern’s show, and recently chatted with Stern and co-host Robin Quivers in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal.

In a frequently explicit discussion, Stern asked Takei if he’d ever grabbed somebody “against their will” — and the actor’s response made the radio host joke that he might need to call the police.

Below is a transcript:

Howard Stern: Did you ever grab anybody by the c--k against their will?

[Very long pause]

George Takei: Uhhhh ... uh oh! [laughter]

Stern: Well they were different times, you never sexually harassed anybody... have you?

Takei: [Laughter] ... Some people that are kind of, um, um, skittish. Or maybe, uh ... afraid. And you’re trying to persuade. But, you know ...

Stern: Do we need to call the police? What are you saying, George? You never held a job over someone if they didn’t touch your c--k?

Takei: No, no, no, no. I never did that. That’s what this is all about. It’s not about sex, it’s about power.

Robin Quivers: But you didn’t do this grabbing at work?

Takei: Oh no, no, no. It was never at work. They came to my home.

Stern: Maybe it was some guy who was hesitating to have sex with you and you gave him a gentle squeeze on the b---s or something?

Takei: ... More than gentle [laughter]. But it didn’t involve power over the other.

In a series of tweets responding to Burton’s allegation over the weekend, Takei, 80, said that “The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do.”

Pendants, uplights, downlights, LEDs — are you confused by all the options out there in kitchen lighting when it comes to creating the illumination you need to prep, cook and dine? We’ve asked expert Ben Mills to explain the different lighting types and the main things to consider in planning an effective design.

Why is kitchen lighting so important? For most of us, the kitchen is the workhorse of the home and a busy spot from morning till night. Good lighting is essential, as it allows you to perform tasks such as prepping food and cleaning up safely, says Mills, executive general manager at Australia’s Crompton Lighting. Plus, it adds character to a space and can quickly take the mood from functional to cozy, perfect for an eat-in kitchen.

Plan lighting as early as possible. Moving light fixtures after a kitchen has been installed can be expensive: Rewiring and repainting mean costs can add up quickly. For that reason, it’s best to plan kitchen lighting during the design stage.

What is a layered lighting design? Light layering involves creating different shades of light, playing with shadows and using colors to highlight a room’s best features. In the kitchen, it generally incorporates task lighting for food prep and cooking, ambient lighting for general illumination and character, and accent lighting to highlight specific features such as a gorgeous backsplash or a piece of art.

Consider safety first. The first priority of kitchen lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for safe and efficient meal prep, cooking and cleaning. This is achieved with task lighting — think LED strip lights under an upper cabinet (these create a lovely, even light with no shadows or heat) or a track system over the island.

Make sure there are no shadows in your prep zones. The best way to do is this is to install task lighting in front of or above you, rather than behind you.

Add ambient lighting for character. Soft, ambient lighting will wash your kitchen with light and create a warm, welcoming glow. It could be in the form of a pendant above a counter or dining table, downlights around the perimeter of the room or a central ceiling light.

Highlight your best features with accent light. Use accent lighting to draw attention to special features such as a backsplash or a dramatic island facade. Installing strip lighting under cabinets or counters is a great way to achieve this. You could also add accent lighting to glass cabinets or open shelving to highlight your displays.

Choose the right style. When it comes to choosing kitchen lights, take your cues from your home’s architecture and the lighting styles in the rest of the home. Choosing similar styles (or at least having a unifying theme such as shape or finish) will create a sense of flow among the spaces. This is particularly important in an open-plan kitchen that flows directly into a living or dining area.

When it comes to decorative lighting trends, the Scandi look is still popular, as well as simple styles in natural wood and black, white and industrial metallics.

Get the proportions right. With pendant lights and other decorative styles, size is also important: too large and the fixture will overwhelm a small kitchen; too small and it may get lost in a large space.

It’s also important to hang the pendant at an appropriate height to reduce the risk of people bumping their heads. Generally speaking, it should be about 32 inches above a table or counter.

Take control. Lighting control systems allow you to alter the illumination as needed and change the mood of the space. With dimmers, for example, you can go from bright lighting for precision cooking to a warm glow for dining. Having controls on separate switch plates lets you control lights in different areas separately.

The new “King of the Hill” has a 755 hp 6.2-liter V8 sticking out of its hood, thanks to a supercharger that’s over 50 percent larger than the one used by the now relatively weak-kneed 650 hp Corvette Z06.

Consider for a moment that is also 300 hp more than the base Corvette Stingray and you realize this car means the business. The engine is fitted with port and direct fuel injection and also sends 715 lb-ft of torque to the rear wheels through a standard 7-speed manual, or optional 8-speed automatic transmission.

Chevy hasn’t revealed how quick it is, but says the ZR1 will break the 210 mph barrier, which could put it within range of the $450,000 2016 mph Ford GT.

That’s if you order it with the Low Wing aerodynamic package, which was designed to create tremendous downforce with little drag. An enormous High Wing is also available that’s adjustable and can plant the 14-inch wide rear tires to the ground with up to 950 pounds of pressure.

It can do that because it's mounted to the chassis aft of the hatchback opening for strength, which presents the downside of making you lift your groceries up and over the wing to get them in the trunk. (Chevy's sorry not sorry about that.)

An underbody front wing helps to balance out the handling and leaves plenty of space above it for three air intakes that help feed some of the baker’s dozen of heat exchangers needed to keep the ZR1’s components cool.

The car is undeniably cool, even when it’s parked, but will surely look even better when it hits the street and track next spring at a price that hasn’t been announced, but will likely be north of the $112,000 the last ZR1 went for in 2012.

Dubbed the “Hesla,” the modification adds a second charging supply to the existing electrical system, using a tank of hydrogen as an alternative fuel source.

Last week, the Holthausen Group announced that it had begun testing the prototype vehicle. With a fully charged battery and a tank of hydrogen, the Helsa can travel close to 620 miles — nearly twice the range of the stock Model S P100D.

The project was not endorsed or supported by Tesla in any way, so Holthausen had to acquire a second-hand Model S for its modifications. Max Holthausen, one of the engineers, said it was difficult to add a second power source to the existing Tesla electrical system, calling it “a big maze.” After some engineering trickery, the Hesla prototype can run on power from either the existing battery or the hydrogen-powered fuel cells.

Don’t plan on tricking out your Model S with a hydrogen option anytime soon, however. The conversion runs nearly $60,000, according to The Drive, so a hydrogen-supplemented P100D would set you back more than $200,000.

Then there’s the problem of filling up the tank. As Futurism notes, there are only 39 hydrogen fueling stations in the U.S., with the vast majority located in California. Although hydrogen fuel cells are currently prohibitively expensive, industry executives predict that hydrogen-powered vehicles will be as cheap as hybrids in the near future.

Other automakers expect hydrogen power to be a viable alternative as soon as the next decade, according to an Autocar report from the Tokyo motor show. “In the early 2020s we will launch the next generation hydrogen fuel stack technology, and that will provide a substantial move forward,” said Naomichi Hata of Toyota, makers of the hydrogen-powered Mirai. “As a result of these gains we expect — in Japan at least — the same car type to cost the same price whether it is a hybrid or powered by hydrogen.”

Hydrogen fuel has its pros and cons, but other automakers such as Honda, Hyundai, and GM are embracing the new technology in their upcoming models.

Two years later, Desiree Ford, a 22-year-old Houston woman, died only hours after applying a pain cream to her skin.
The Harris County medical examiner ruled that her death was caused by the toxic effects of two drugs in the pain cream.","A Mississippi doctor was hit last month with a 16-count indictment for allegedly defrauding a government health care program of more than $2.3 million by prescribing unnecessary and highly suspect compound pain creams to patients he never examined.

The details in Albert Diaz’s indictment highlight the growing scams carried out by medical professionals and pharmacists to hock phony pain ointments that only function to bilk taxpayers of millions of dollars and, in some cases, leave patients dead.

In numerous ploys reminiscent of 19th century snake oil salesmen, pharmacy owners and marketers are bribing or giving kickbacks to doctors for writing spurious prescriptions to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare patients for costly, dangerous and unneeded pain and scar creams. These compounded ointments – many of which have been found to contain a powerful anesthetic and sedative known as ketamine – have led to at least two deaths and can cost the government up to $28,000 per cream container.

“The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams,” wrote Carol Crisci, an attorney at Chartwell Law Offices. “If these creams worked, and actually reduced patient reliance on oral narcotics, the high price might be warranted. The problem is that there is little evidence that the creams or many of their expensive ingredients actually work when rubbed into the skin.”

Once the predominant form of pharmacy in the U.S. before the advent of mass drug manufacturing in the 1950s, compounding pharmacies mix medications and ingredients based on a doctor’s prescription for strength and dosage. While this allows pharmacists to specifically tailor a medication for patients who may have an allergy to certain ingredients or need a higher or lower dosage than produced, it can also lead to scams and abuse like the fraudulent pain creams.

After more than 50 people died from fungal meningitis and another 680 were sickened after receiving injections in 2012 of a contaminated steroid made by the New England Compounding Center, the Food and Drug Administration investigated and found 30 compounding pharmacies across 18 states with numerous unsafe practices.

In the case of the pain cream schemes, which have been unearthed from New Jersey to California, all follow a similar pattern, with doctors and compound pharmacies working hand-in-hand to prescribe patients these bogus ointments and reaping the financial benefits when the government paid the tab. Pharmacists also have been known to change the ingredients and exploit the narrow legitimate medical uses of the creams to keep ahead of the law.

""The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams."" - Carol Crisci, attorney at Chartwell Law Offices

In two active cases in Texas, pharmacies allegedly defrauded the government of more than $180 million. In one case, the Dallas Morning News reported that Fort Worth’s Ability Pharmacy spent $15 to make a container of cream and charged $28,000 to the government, with federal prosecutors claiming the pharmacy took in $1 million a day on these compound medications alone.

There was no difference in any of the creams given to different patients and many of the patients prescribed the ointments did not have any pain or scars to treat.

“This is yet another shocking example of how unmitigated greed can spawn a fraud so brazen that it almost takes your breath away,” John Parker, the U.S. attorney in Dallas, told the Dallas Morning News. “I would suggest that the costs of playing these games far outweigh whatever short-term gains are realized, no matter their size.”

More nefarious than the financial fraud behind the schemes is the sometimes deadly consequences of taking these creams and ointments.

A baby in California died in 2012 after accidently ingesting her mother’s compound cream, which was ultimately linked to a shady kickback scheme.

Two years later, Desiree Ford, a 22-year-old Houston woman, died only hours after applying a pain cream to her skin. The Harris County medical examiner ruled that her death was caused by the toxic effects of two drugs in the pain cream.

Ford’s father, Richard, is suing the pharmacy that supplied his daughter with the cream, while the doctor who prescribed it – without having talked to or examined her – surrendered his medical license.

“They’re just terrible people,” Ford said. “They make so much money off this, it could be their full-time job.”",Bogus pain creams are costing taxpayers millions -- and their lives,https://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/11/13/bogus-pain-creams-are-costing-taxpayers-millions-and-their-lives.html

Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.","You don’t have to be a cable news or Twitter junkie like me to know that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is in serious trouble.

The Washington Post revealed Thursday that Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct by four women, including one woman who was just 14 when the 32-year old Moore allegedly assaulted her. That’s the definition of pedophilia for those who are on the fence. And Monday we heard a statement from Beverly Young Nelson, who alleges that Moore assaulted her when she was just 16, telling her “if you tell anyone about this no one will believe you.”

The other women in the Washington Post story were in their teens so I’m hard pressed to consider the 14-year old Moore’s one big mistake. His ex-colleague said it was “common knowledge” that Moore “dated high school girls” into his 30s and would hang around high school football games and the mall. You’d think a legal mind as great as Moore would have better things to do, but I digress.

I’m sure you’ve already read a bunch of pieces on the attempt to discredit these women by using the phrase “if true” before any statement about Moore’s alleged activities. And you’ve probably seen the faux outrage over Jerry Seinfeld’s relationship with a 17-year old or my personal favorite that JFK had an affair with 19-year old Mimi Alford when he was 45.

My suggestion is that no one vote for Jerry Seinfeld if he runs for public office. As for JFK, you can also not vote for him if he somehow comes back from the dead.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden.

When you get into the realm of Bill Clinton’s accusers things inevitably get trickier, but the good news there is that there are no Clintons left on any ballots, including the one who never has been accused of assaulting anyone.

It looks like Alabamans are skeptical of Moore’s protestations, just like Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is. He said that he believes the women and Moore should step aside. So does the chair of the Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who says Moore should withdraw and if he doesn’t, and he wins, then the Senate should expel him.

The first two polls conducted since the allegations broke shows Democrat Doug Jones ahead by four points – a 12-point reversal in one of them.

Moore is busy furiously fundraising off this “fake news” accusation and Democrats are stepping up all over the country for Jones. Prominent Senators like Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chris Murphy are all working their social channels and phones for Jones. And their followers are doing their part, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the insurgent campaign.

Democrats won’t stop. But I sincerely hope they will continue to back Jones from afar.

Top Democrat brass should take note: if Tuesday’s wins felt as good for you as they did for me and you’d like to be the winning team again, stay out of Alabama. Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.

If he has to trash Nancy Pelosi, so be it. If he has to say that Hillary Clinton was the wrong candidate for this election and Joe Biden would’ve won, so it goes. If he has to say that the Democrat primary was rigged and Bernie never had a chance, that’s how the cookie crumbles. And if he has to say that the media is biased, let it slide.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.

So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden and host a fundraiser for Jones in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago or just about anywhere else than Mobile.

The aircraft is debuting to the public at Aviation Nation, an annual air show at the base.

The jet originally was going to be painted to honor the 70th anniversary of the Air Force, but when the tragedy happened, airmen decided to memorialize the event by treating a static, retired F-15 fighter jet as a canvas.

In just three short weeks, the plane’s paint job was complete, and it had to remain a secret among members of the base.

“The Air Force’s motto is adapt and overcome, and that’s what we did throughout the process. Everybody stepped up,” said Troy Blaschko, an aircraft painter.

He added, “We were very proud to be a part of this.”

The plane won’t be doing any flying, but will be on display for the duration of the air show, which is expected to draw over 400,000 people. It is one of the largest air shows in the western United States. Nellis Air Force Base is home to the Thunderbirds, the famous air demonstration squadron.

The base is integral to the wider Las Vegas community and was directly impacted by the shooting.

“We have some healing to do too. … The passion and the honor of the paint team and design crews as they put this airplane together piece by piece, and scrubbed it piece by piece with meticulous detail was all based on the honor of being able to give back something to the community,” said Major General Peter Gersten.

Around 20 people were involved in the project. Some of the motifs and images have a lot of detail. “Vegas Strong” is painted on the left fuselage, while also including the famous Las Vegas sign and the city’s skyline featured in other areas on the plane.

This wasn’t the only paint job Blaschko and his team undertook. On the opening day of the show, there was one surprise. The same painters also were tasked with a second job: painting Vegas’ new motto, “Vegas Strong” onto the tail of an F-16. This aircraft did fly for the spectators during the show, flying low enough so people on the ground could see it.

“I don’t think there’s anybody in the Las Vegas valley that did not know someone who was affected.

That bill was ultimately passed in a bipartisan vote, and was signed by President George H.W. Bush.

But despite the bipartisan passage of the program, President Trump has called for its elimination, and the termination of chain migration, which happens when immigrants can enter the country, simply to be united with a relative already living in the U.S.

Trump’s latest calls for these programs to end stemmed from the revelations that the ISIS-sympathizer, Sayfullo Saipov, who allegedly carried out the Halloween terror attack in New York City that killed eight and injured 11, entered the U.S. through the lottery system in 2010 from Uzbekistan.

“I am calling on Congress to TERMINATE the diversity visa lottery program that presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security,” Trump tweeted earlier this month following the attack. “Congress must end chain migration so that we can have a system that is SECURITY BASED! We need to make AMERICA SAFE! #USA.”

According to the State Department, in 2004, the agency’s deputy inspector general warned that the program contained “significant threats to national security as hostile intelligence officers, criminals, and terrorists attempt to use it” to enter the U.S.

More than a decade later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is making the same warning.

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS BACK TRUMP'S CALL FOR TIGHTENING IMMIGRATION LAW IN WAKE OF ATTACK

“A merit-based system, by definition, would be safer than a lottery or even extended family-based immigration,” Sessions said in a speech in New York City earlier this month, saying “we don’t use random chance in college admissions and we don’t roll a die to hire people,” and called for a “rational” system.

Even Congressional Republicans, including those who are not typically in lockstep with the president, have rallied around his call for “extreme vetting” and the repeal, or reform of the program in the wake of the New York City terror attack.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the attack underscored the need for “merit-based immigration,” and said “it makes no sense” to hand out visas and green cards in a random way.

Other Republican lawmakers also called for policy reforms, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said the program should be scrapped and replaced with a merit-based immigration system, in a rare moment of agreement between Trump and the senator.

And Sens. David Perdue, R-Ga., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., proposed eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery Program as part of the RAISE Act.

“While Senate Democrats originally created the Diversity Visa Lottery in 1990, many have supported legislation that would have eliminated it in the years since,” Perdue said in a statement. “I hope we can include this area of common ground as we work to fix our broken immigration system and strengthen our national security.”

The Trump White House came out in support of the bill, calling the DV program “outdated,” adding that it “serves questionable economic and humanitarian interests.”

The Ohio State University has accused 83 of its students of cheating by using the GroupMe app to work on classwork together.

SNAPCHAT IS GETTING A NEW LOOK BECAUSE IT'S 'TOO HARD TO USE'

Ohio State University said the students abused the code of conduct, citing “unauthorized collaboration on graded assignments.”

“Students charged with academic misconduct violations may accept responsibility for the charges or request a hearing...” Ohio State University spokesman Benjamin Johnson said in a statement obtained by news outlet WCHMH. “If found in violation, students receive sanctions based on the nature and severity of the violation in accordance with university standards and protocols.”

The app, which lets users send chats to large groups of people simultaneously, is permitted to be used by the school's rules, but is subject to the same scrutiny as any other form of communication. GroupMe is not among the top 50 apps in the App Store or Google Play, but it is ranked 14th among social networking apps in the App Store.

Fox News 8 in Cleveland noted that the investigation began after a professor in the university's business school reported the allegations this past April.

The names of the students have not been released. Potential penalties range from warnings to expulsion.

The bloody scene in the ski town of Park City indicated that Keri ""KC"" McClanahan, 28, put up a desperate struggle before she was killed. The murder weapon was a small, sharp knife she'd worn sheathed in a nylon paracord bracelet, charging documents state.

Police found her husband, Anthony D. McClanahan, 46, covered in blood and crawling on his stomach outside early in the morning of Nov. 2. He lifted himself up just enough to flag down a police officer, then dropped back down and began convulsing, his arms making a ""snow angel motion,"" the officer on scene told prosecutors.

Anthony McClanahan was treated for minor injuries and originally told officers he and his wife and baby had been attacked. Investigators, though, found no evidence of anyone else going into the building or of a baby at the Park Regency.

His wife's body was found in the condominium he had rented after someone else at the building called 911, saying they'd seen him crawling low to the ground through the hallways and calling for help. Keri McClanahan had suffered several cuts to the front, back and sides of her neck, as well as other defensive wounds and carpet burns.

McClanahan was previously charged with child kidnapping last month after authorities said he took his 8-year-old son from a previous relationship from his school in Arizona on Oct. 3 and traveled with him through Nevada and Utah.

He was arrested in Utah on Oct. 12 and gave his son back, then bonded out of jail a week later.

""In an abundance of caution, passengers inside the terminal were instructed to exit the building while Orlando Police and Orlando International Airport staff investigated,” the airport said.

Once searched, the noise was discovered to have been a lithium ion camera battery that had exploded and caught fire inside the camera bag, which began to smoke.

The Greater Orlando International Aviation Authority CEO Phil Brown said in a letter posted online Saturday that the passenger “immediately dropped the bag and those around them moved away from it. Emergency services arrived quickly and moved the bag farther away” from the crowds.

WESH 2 further reported that the officer who grabbed the bag was well equipped to handle the situation.

The TSA has also lauded Perez's actions in an Instagram post, saying that Perez put everyone else's safety ""before his own,"" and lauding him as a hero.

After the incident, thousands of people were forced to go back through the TSA lines, causing severe delays and flight cancelations.

The loud event also led to panic throughout the airport, with some believing the noise generated by the incident — along with the sound of the stanchions falling in the wake of the scared passegners — were from gunfire.

""Others hearing the luggage being dropped, stanchions falling, and rapid movement mistook the sounds as gunfire and within seconds a spontaneous evacuation of the main terminal occurred,"" Brown said in the letter.

Orlando police posted on Twitter that there was no shooting.

Brown said in the letter that emergency staff tried to restore calm “but as everyone is aware, a few trying to communicate a message to this large of a mass is a daunting task.”

After an investigation, the battery responsible for the incident was reported to have been a camera battery, which is legal aboard flights. The Federal Aviation Administration allows lithium ion batteries under 100 watt hours in carry-on luggage, which includes most consumer-sized batteries for cell phones, cameras and other personal electronic devices.

She recently mistakenly referred to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher as a woman and received backlash after quickly blaming the GOP for a deadly mass shooting. This time, Handler thought she had a clever tweet about President Trump but it backfired when Broaddrick caught wind of it.

Broaddrick has said that Clinton raped her in April 1978 and that Hillary Clinton intimidated her in an effort to keep her silent about the situation. She finally gave an interview to NBC in 1999 but the network didn’t air it until Clinton’s impeachment process ended with an acquittal.

Last year, Michael Isikoff, the legendary investigative reporter who uncovered the Monica Lewinsky scandal only to have it spiked by Newsweek, called on NBC to release the full tape of its 1999 interview with Broaddrick – who has accused the network of editing out a portion of her interview in which she discussed Hillary Clinton’s role silencing her and other victims.

Broaddrick and two other Clinton accusers, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones, participated in a press conference with then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign to discuss their past allegations of sexual impropriety against Clinton when Trump was running against Hillary.

In fact, it seems it has just begun.

Swift’s latest album “Reputation” was released Friday and fans were eagerly awaiting to see if the pop singer would address her longtime feud with the rapper.

Swift already appeared to take shots at West on her album’s first single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” But Swift's new tune “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” threw some more shade at West, People reported.

""It was so nice being friends again/ where I was giving you a second chance/ but you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,"" Swift’s lyrics read.

West and Swift did make up briefly but their truce was short lived. Their issues began in 2009 when West infamously stormed the stage at MTV’s Video Music Awards to say Beyonce deserved the award Swift won.

“But I’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately / Mm mm / If only you weren’t so shady,” Swift sang.

The jab appeared to reference West’s new feud with rapper and collaborator Jay-Z. The two reportedly had a falling out last summer, People reported.

Swift also sang her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, “ain’t reading what they call me lately” and her mother “had to listen to all this drama.”

“‘Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do / I can’t even say it with a straight face,” Swift laughed while singing the song.

Entertainment Tonight reported Swift’s track “I Did Something Bad” could also be about West -- or a jab to her ex boyfriend Calvin Harris.

“Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three,"" Swift sang.

""If a man talks s--t then I owe him nothin' / I don't regret it one bit because he had it comin.'""

Harris and Swift also had a public feud after their breakup. It was revealed Swift collaborated with Harris on his hit song “This Is What You Came For.” Swift was reportedly upset Harris told Ryan Seacrest that he did not want to work with the pop star in the future. Swift revealed she wrote the song and the news prompted a negative response from Harris.

“I wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut the vocals though. And initially she wanted it kept secret, hence the pseudonym,” Harris tweeted.

“I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it,” Harris tweeted.

House Speaker Paul Ryan on FOX News Sunday says the reform bill with a trillion-dollar tax cut is on pace to pass the House by Thanksgiving. But critics say key deductions are being left out of the proposal.

Host Chris Wallace pressed the Speaker on what it could mean for many, like those paying off student loans:

(Wallace) ""If I'm able to deduct the interest rate. Now I'm losing that, if I have huge medical expenses and I'm able to deduct the medical.""

Open shelves in the kitchen can be used to store almost anything, but what should you place on them that truly works best? Here are some of my favorite uses for open shelving, along with some style tips to get the best arrangement for your kitchen.

Open shelves are a love-it or leave-it idea, but for those who love them, the breezy appeal is undeniable. They take an extra investment of time compared to closed cabinets (as more tidying is necessary), but they can add a lot of style and functionality without too much work.

Open shelves are especially suitable, I think, to transitional kitchen designs, in which a balance of traditional and contemporary sensibilities come together to produce beautifully livable spaces.

Daily Essentials

Some of the most common items to spot on open kitchen shelves are daily essentials like coffee mugs, plates and bowls. Items like this work well on open shelves for two reasons.

First, they’re kept in easy reach, which speeds up your morning just that little extra bit. And it’s especially convenient for guests who may want to grab a coffee mug or water glass without having to poke through every cabinet.

Second, putting often-used items on shelves avoids the issue of dust buildup. If the items are used frequently, they won’t sit for long. If you keep rarely used items like specialty glasses or serving pitchers on open shelves, be prepared to give them a rinse before use.

Drinking Glasses

Glasses are especially attractive items to store on an open shelf because their clear material plays into the breezy look. Storing basic drinking glasses upside down (as is typically done in restaurants) effectively seals out dust and debris, so the glass is ready to go whenever you grab it.

Again, for less commonly used pieces like martini glasses (for some, anyway), a quick rinse will generally do the trick before use, along with the occasional seasonal dusting.

Storage Jars

Storage jars are another great use for an easily reached shelf. This keeps items off the counter so you have more free space to work, but the jars are still handy so you can grab them without having to open a cabinet with (potentially) messy fingers.

Colorful Pieces

Besides practical uses, open shelves can also add a lot of character and beauty to a kitchen. Whether you already have a colorful kitchen or a more neutral scheme, shelves are a great place to introduce a new accent hue, such as classic rich-blue water glasses or copper mule mugs.

White Porcelain

In contrast to the previous tip, sometimes the items on open shelves can serve as a visual break on an already busy wall. If you have a dramatic tile or a stunning brick feature, simple white porcelain and other subdued pieces provide a pleasing counterpoint.

Coffee Station

If you have a nice coffee maker, you’ll likely want to carve out a little space to hold fresh beans, sugar, coffee spoons and other supplies to craft the perfect cup. A floating shelf above the machine creates a simple station to store everything, plus a few good go-to cookbooks.

And of course, for the tea drinkers (or home-soda aficionados), you can stash tea bags, honeys and syrups, cups and saucers … the list goes on. Just be sure to consider whether such items will be OK outside the fridge and potentially exposed to warm sunlight or exhaust from nearby appliances.

Home Bar

If you drink alcohol, you can also take an array of beautifully bottled liquors and make them into a simple home bar. Richly hued glass bottles with ornate labels make for a subtly colorful display with a sophisticated air, especially when paired with classic bar tools in a golden finish. To keep the arrangement lasting, you can always refill an emptied bottle with water and mix it back onto the shelf.

Cookware

If you cook often, you may want to have more than just your ingredients right at hand. Stacking casserole dishes, cake pans or even pasta pots on a shelf keeps them from getting buried in the back of cabinets. The look works especially well for kitchens with a rustic or industrial edge, where a little controlled chaos adds to the charm.

Tech Devices

Here’s an option you might never have thought of: using open shelves to dock your devices, like tablets or laptops. Angled shelves are great for storing devices securely, with any charging cables discreetly tucked behind the lip. It’s especially handy for those who cook along to online recipes. Alternately, you can locate them on a side wall out of the main cooking area, paired with some books to make an attractive library-like display.

Decorative Pieces

Do you love the look of open shelves but are concerned about having to dust lots of items? Consider using just a single shelf with only a few decorative pieces. You won’t have too much space to worry about filling or maintaining, but it will add a fun, contemporary twist to the space.

A Few Style Tips

To help you get the function and the look you love, try these kitchen shelf styling tips.

Play with heights and directions. Playing with the arrangement by mixing different-sized objects and small or short stacks of items creates a dynamic look.

Mix eclectic items. It also helps to mix diverse items, both practical and decorative pieces.

Go tone on tone. If you prefer a more subdued look, try sticking to all pale-colored objects. Try contrasting whites and off-whites to highlight the subtle undertones, along with a touch of glass and the occasional metallic accent.

Top with an upper shelf. Sometimes the best thing to put on your top shelf is: nothing! Leaving a bare top shelf as a topper gives a polished look to your shelving, which makes the whole space feel subtly tidier.

Highlight with a sconce. Finally, to really bring out the best of your shelving, add a sconce above to cast a little light on the situation. Don’t have the option of hardwiring a fixture? Choose a plug-in sconce that comes with an elegantly simple metal channel to hide wires, run it down behind the shelving or next to a cabinet, and let it add to the open look – or simply run the wires back to a cabinet so they can be hidden to reach a power source.",10 things to store on open kitchen shelves for efficiency and style,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/10-things-to-store-on-open-kitchen-shelves-for-efficiency-and-style.html

The song was inspired by the countless accusations of sexual harassment and assault lobbied against Harvey Weinstein and numerous other powerful men in Hollywood.

""I am surrounded by females in my life. I grew up in a house with boys, no sisters. Now I am in a house that's all girls. So this song speaks to me on a lot of levels,"" he said.

Holiday festivities with extended family members often make for tight sleeping quarters, and 52 percent of American adults have admitted to inventing excuses “specifically to avoid uncomfortable sleeping arrangements” at relative’s homes, according to a new study from INTEX.

While it feels good to know that you’re not the only one who shudders at the thought of a night of restless sleep on your great-aunt’s vintage sofa-chair, respondents duly reported that lackluster bedding accommodations are their motivation to politely exit soon after dessert.

At this point, it's worth noting that INTEX — or the Intex Recreation Corp — is a manufacturer of ""air mattresses and air beds,"" as well as toys, furniture, boats and above-ground pools.

That said, the company's study claims that, during the holidays, 62 percent of respondents said they’ve slept on the couch and 44 percent said they’ve spent the night on the floor, like in a sleeping bag. And 39 percent said they had been assigned a bed that was uncomfortably small.

FLIGHT REPORTEDLY DIVERTED AFTER WOMAN UNLOCKS HUSBAND'S PHONE AND UNCOVERS AFFAIR

If you thought that sounded rough, others had it even worse. Thirteen percent of adults polled said that they’d been relegated to a child-themed bed, and 7 percent even said they’ve had to sleep in a tent. For these reasons, and limited options, 46 percent of respondents said that figuring out sleeping arrangements are more likely to cause arguments than agreeing on a television program or movie for everyone to watch together.

As the cost of travel inevitably rockets during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukah and New Year’s, it can be tough to turn down free lodgings, but there’s no reason to feel guilty about putting the wellbeing of yourself and loved ones first. If that means getting a great night’s sleep in a hotel bed after a family soiree, so be it.

Even with that generous definition of on-time, airlines try to account for everything that could possibly go wrong.
“We regularly review our flight plans and timings to ensure that we can meet our published departure and arrival times and customers can plan their journeys accordingly,” a British Airways spokesperson told the Telegraph.","Whether you always get to the airport hours before your flight or you waltz in minutes before cut-off time, you still spend more time waiting than you should.

The arrival and departure times airlines share with their customers often don’t match how long an aircraft actually needs to spend in the air. Airlines exaggerate how long a trip will take so that even when there’s a delay, the plane still arrives “on time,"" a strategy known as “schedule padding.”

The Telegraph reported that between 1996 and 2015, the allotted time for a flight from London’s Heathrow airport to Scotland’s Edinburgh has increased significantly, despite improvements in technology, almost entirely due to schedule padding. An AirTran Airways pilot confessed to Reader’s Digest that “airlines really have adjusted their flight arrival times so they can have a better record of on-time arrivals, so they might say a flight takes two hours when it really takes an hour and 45 minutes.”

To make matters worse, the definition of “on-time arrival” isn’t all that it’s cut out to be. Flightstats.com, a site that issues awards for on-time performance (OTP), counts every flight that lands within 15 minutes of its stated arrival time. Even with that generous definition of on-time, airlines try to account for everything that could possibly go wrong.

“We regularly review our flight plans and timings to ensure that we can meet our published departure and arrival times and customers can plan their journeys accordingly,” a British Airways spokesperson told the Telegraph. “The weather, type of aircraft, air traffic control restrictions, airport infrastructure and geopolitical considerations will all play a part in the decisions we take about whether to increase or decrease each route’s published flight time in our schedule.”

While there’s still room for improvement when it comes to the way airlines manage their flight schedules, 15 minutes really isn't that big of a deal, all things considered — just don’t be too impressed next time your flight arrives on schedule.

Because of the stigma (of mental illness), we stereotype them.”Dvoskin said in some cases, mental illness might make would-be soldiers “tougher and better” as the result.
But some say accepting recruits with mental health conditions – specifically cutting - puts others at risk, especially in high-pressure situations in the field.
The Army says the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide a case why a waiver should be considered.","Facing low recruitment levels, the U.S. Army quietly lifted its ban on allowing people with a history of mental illness, self-mutilation and drug abuse to serve in the military – despite warnings from the industry about the risks involved.

The new rules green-light recruits who have bipolar disorder, depression and issues with cutting – a process in which a person takes a knife or razor to his or her own skin – along with those who bite, hit or bruise themselves intentionally.

“I am shocked,” Craig Bryan, executive director of the National Center for Veterans Studies at The University of Utah, told Fox News. “This contradicts everything we have been working toward for the past 10-to-15 years.”

“This contradicts everything we have been working toward for the past 10-to-15 years.” - Craig Bryan, National Center for Veterans Studies

Bryan says there is strong evidence to indicate self-injury is a “stepping stone to suicide” and is “the single strongest predictor of suicidal behavior.”

The Army signed off on the new policy in August but never announced it, according to USA Today, which first reported the news.

The decision to lift restrictions comes as the military looks like it will miss its goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018.

In order to hit last year’s goal of 69,000 recruits, the Army also accepted men and women who did poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers for pot use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.

In fiscal year 2017, it paid out $424 million in bonuses, up from $284 million in 2016. In 2014, that figure was $8.2 million. According to USA Today, some of the recruits qualified for bonuses of $40,000.

When it comes to mental health, recruits who would have previously been barred can submit waivers allowing them to sign up.

The change reverses an eight-year ban on the wavers following a spike of suicides.

The move is especially troubling following the Texas church massacre a week ago, in which 26 people were killed and another 20 injured when Devin Patrick Kelley, a veteran with a history of psychiatric problems, opened fire inside the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.

Following the deadly episode, it was revealed that Kelley made death threats against his superiors and escaped from a mental hospital during his stint in the Air Force.

Army spokesman Lt. Col. Randy Taylor says the waiver expansion was possible because the government has more access to applicants’ medical records.

“These records allow Army officials to better document applicant medical histories,” he said – but adds that the “waivers are not considered lightly.”

Dr. Joel Dvoskin, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the University of Arizona's Department of Psychiatry, told Fox News he believes lifting the ban is a step in the right direction.

“The label of mental illness is meaningless,” he said. “There are a ton of people who have a history of something – some kind of emotional trouble – and they are fine. There is no reason in the world they couldn’t serve in the military.”

He added, “Stereotypes are pretty evil all the way around. Because of the stigma (of mental illness), we stereotype them.”

Dvoskin said in some cases, mental illness might make would-be soldiers “tougher and better” as the result.

But some say accepting recruits with mental health conditions – specifically cutting - puts others at risk, especially in high-pressure situations in the field.

“Is it a red flag,” Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatrist who retired from the Army in 2010, said. “The question is, how much of a red flag is it?”

According to the Army, recruits with a history of self-mutilation must provide documentation that includes a detailed statement from the applicant, medical records, photos submitted by the recruiter and a psych evaluation.

The Army says the burden of proof will be on the applicant to provide a case why a waiver should be considered.","Army lifts ban on cutters, mentally ill and drug abusers to meet recruiting goals",http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/11/13/army-lifts-ban-on-cutters-mentally-ill-and-drug-abusers-to-meet-recruiting-goals.html

To James, Nemo was another one of his kids.
After two years, the family decided Nemo needed company, so they brought home Lucy, another Bichon.
The Xuereb family had to make the difficult decision to put down their 13-year-old companion to stop his suffering.","Few things can mend a broken heart or a troubled mind.

But for James Xuereb the answer seems to always be the same: a loving dog.

A video of James receiving a Bichon Frise as an early birthday gift has gone viral and touched the hearts of many.

In the video, you see his daughter Jaleen handing him a card as he sits unwittingly on the couch.

The photo on the card is almost a dead giveaway -- a photo of a Bichon. But what's written inside and the story behind it brings the 52-year-old man to a heartfelt cry.

It read: ""Hi, my name is Lumo and I am a boy Bichon. No, I am not Nemo, nor could I ever be Lucy, but my mommy brought me to bring you some happiness back into your life. So, as we walk in this journey of life together, may we create our own wonderful memories and reclaim the beautiful memories that you had with Nemo and Lucy. Love, Lumo.""

What elicited such a strong emotion?

More than 13 years ago, James was going through a state of depression. Nothing would cheer him up. That's when, according to Jaleen, his wife Wanda brought him home Nemo, a Bichon Frise puppy. James instantly fell in love.

""He had an attachment to him. He leaned on him for anything and everything,"" says Jaleen of their relationship.

To James, Nemo was another one of his kids. His best friend.

After two years, the family decided Nemo needed company, so they brought home Lucy, another Bichon.

Both dogs, as is common with small breeds, suffered from a congenital heart defect.

Sadly, in late August, Lucy, 11, suffered a cardiac arrest that took her life. Two weeks later, things went from bad to worse.

Nemo's health was deteriorating. His lungs were filled with liquid and he had a hard time breathing. The Xuereb family had to make the difficult decision to put down their 13-year-old companion to stop his suffering.

""My dad was on edge,"" Jaleen recalls. ""He didn't want to talk about [Lucy and Nemo]. He would leave the room if we did. Or he would start crying.""

Meantime, the family put up photos and contemplated ways to make Xuereb feel better.

So Wanda decided it may be time for a new dog. She researched breeders, and found Fern Klapman-Flett's Bichon Lovers in Simcoe, Ontario.

In October, Wanda, and her daughters Jaleen and Jade, went to the breeder to meet a new litter.

""We went back in November to make our pick,"" Jaleen said. ""When we walked through the door, one came up to us and kept pulling on my mom's pants.""

It was number 25, and he kept coming to them and tugging at them.

""That's how we knew.""

Next came the card, the heartfelt cry, and tiny Lumo.

Lumo's name is a testament to the family's fallen -- L-U for Lucy, M-O for Nemo -- the two whose deaths were too much to bear.

But thanks to Lumo, James can finally talk about Lucy and Nemo and smile.

The Ohio State University has accused 83 of its students of cheating by using the GroupMe app to work on classwork together.

SNAPCHAT IS GETTING A NEW LOOK BECAUSE IT'S 'TOO HARD TO USE'

Ohio State University said the students abused the code of conduct, citing “unauthorized collaboration on graded assignments.”

“Students charged with academic misconduct violations may accept responsibility for the charges or request a hearing...” Ohio State University spokesman Benjamin Johnson said in a statement obtained by news outlet WCHMH. “If found in violation, students receive sanctions based on the nature and severity of the violation in accordance with university standards and protocols.”

The app, which lets users send chats to large groups of people simultaneously, is permitted to be used by the school's rules, but is subject to the same scrutiny as any other form of communication. GroupMe is not among the top 50 apps in the App Store or Google Play, but it is ranked 14th among social networking apps in the App Store.

Fox News 8 in Cleveland noted that the investigation began after a professor in the university's business school reported the allegations this past April.

The names of the students have not been released. Potential penalties range from warnings to expulsion.

Allan Simmons has authored books on Scrabble and contributed game coverage to The Times newspaper, which first reported his ban from competition. The London-based newspaper says it will no longer use him as a contributor.

A committee member for the association, Elie Dangoor, said Monday that three independent witnesses saw Simmons put a hand with freshly drawn letter tiles back into a bag to draw more tiles — contrary to the rules.

""The natural conclusion had been that he had been cheating,"" Dangoor told The Associated Press.

There were four instances dating back to 2016, and the committee conducted an independent probe which was concluded a few weeks ago. The matter came to larger public attention only recently, and was discussed during the World English Language Scrabble Players Association event that ended Sunday.

Simmons told the Times he denied cheating, and that he had suffered the same ""untimely bad luck from the bag as anyone else.""

""You have to remember that at the top level, games can be quite intense and there's a lot going through one's mind let alone remembering to religiously ensure tile drawing rules are followed meticulously,"" Simmons was quoted by the Times as saying. ""From the outset I have said that no one is beyond suspicion and complied fully with the investigative process.""

Dangoor said that Simmons had been ""a huge part of the game's development"" and that there was ""great disappointment,"" as he is a liked and respected part of the Scrabble community. But action had to be taken.

""There's no one person bigger than the game,"" Dangoor said.

Efforts to reach Simmons were unsuccessful. The Times quoted him as saying he planned to concentrate on ""more important things in life.""",Scrabble star banned from the game for 'cheating',https://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/11/13/scrabble-star-banned-from-game-for-cheating.html

The Latest on a powerful earthquake near the Iran-Iraq border that has killed more than 400 people (all times local):

10:45 p.m.

Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency is reporting that 445 people were killed and 7,370 injured in the Sunday earthquake along the Iran-Iraq border.

Official reports had put death toll at 407. There was no elaboration on the discrepancy in Tasnim's report, though double-counting is common in the aftermath of such emergency situations in Iran.

More than half of the casualties are from Kurdish-majority town of Sarpol-e Zahab in Kermansh province. The only hospital in the town was heavily damaged and the army set field hospitals.

The magnitude 7.3 quake was centered 19 miles (31 kilometers) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the most recent measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Iran's government declared Tuesday as a national mourning day.

8:45 p.m.

Italy is sending 12 tons of tents, blankets, mobile kitchens and other assistance to victims of the powerful earthquake that struck Iraq and Iran.

The Foreign Ministry said Monday an Italian plane loaded with the aid would be leaving the U.N.'s regional emergency warehouse base in Brindisi, bound for Sulaimaniyah, Iraq, in the coming hours. Separately, the ministry said it was working on a financial aid package for Iran to be funneled through the Red Crescent, which is working on the ground.

The 7.3-magnitutde earthquake killed over 400 people, mainly in Iran.

7:30 p.m.

A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake near the Iraq-Iran border has killed over 400 people across both countries, sent residents fleeing their homes into the night and was felt as far away as the Mediterranean coast.

Iran's western Kermanshah province bore the brunt of the temblor Sunday night, with authorities saying Monday that the quake killed 407 people in Iran and injured 6,700. Kermanshah is a rural, mountainous region where residents rely mainly on farming.

Iraq's Interior Ministry says the earthquake killed at least seven people and injured 535 in the country's northern Kurdish region.

The quake was centered 19 miles (31 kilometers) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the most recent measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey.

A Facebook page called “Boycott the NFL,” boasting more than 227,000 followers, is asking football fans to skip watching Sunday’s games “in solidarity with veterans around the country,” the Washington Times reported.

In New Jersey, a bar in Farmingdale called Woody’s Roadside Tavern plans to hold a fundraiser for veterans and their families, instead of showing NFL games on the bar’s 20 television screens, NJ.com reported.

In Colorado, a decorated local veteran recently turned down an invitation from the Denver Broncos to be honored during Sunday night’s game against the New England Patriots, Fox 31 reported.

And a conservative watchdog group called 2ndVote is asking fans to “stiff-arm the NFL,” according to the Washington Times.

“We’re sending the National Football League, its corporate sponsors, and the television networks a message this Veterans Day weekend!” 2ndVote told the newspaper. “Americans are sick of the disrespectful National Anthem protests that the NFL has not only allowed to continue, but has institutionalized in pregame ceremonies.”

The league and its players union announced Saturday there would be “no change” in league policy regarding the on-field protests, which began last season with a one-man effort by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he wanted to draw attention to police mistreatment of African-Americans across the U.S.

The protests broadened across the league in September, after President Donald Trump told an Alabama crowd that any player protesting during the anthem should be removed from the field.

The president and other critics argued that the playing of the national anthem was the wrong time for protests, regardless of the reason, because the song represents U.S. national unity and respect for those who serve in the military.

Rob Johnson, a co-owner of the New Jersey bar, told NJ.com that their anti-NFL event was inspired by a regular customer who served in Vietnam and felt disrespected by NFL players taking a knee during the anthem.

""While it'll probably cost us some money, we thought it was more important to stand with our veterans,"" Johnson told NJ.com.

""The forces of division prey on our fear of the unfamiliar, the different.
But fear is not of God,"" said DiNardo, in an address to the bishops' fall meeting in Baltimore.

Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, Texas, affirmed the government's authority to protect national security. But he said recent policies and attitudes have often been rooted in unfounded anxiety about people who ""look, talk and even think differently."" That fear is present both within and outside the church, he said.

""The forces of division prey on our fear of the unfamiliar, the different. But fear is not of God,"" said DiNardo, in an address to the bishops' fall meeting in Baltimore. ""They tempt us to see a threat in the stranger.""

DiNardo never mentioned President Donald Trump by name, focusing instead on government policy. DiNardo said the country had a ""moral responsibility"" to protect the border ""in a humane way."" He said a ""pro-life immigration policy is one that does not tear families apart."" And he expressed support for young immigrants known by their advocates as Dreamers. For ""those who have only known the United States as their home, we make Pope Francis' words our own: keep on dreaming,"" DiNardo said.

Trump has said an aggressive deportation policy and restrictions on refugee entry to the U.S. are critical for national security. His administration has decided to phase out temporary deportation protections enacted under former President Barack Obama for a number of those young people brought to the country illegally as children, giving Congress until March to come up with a new policy. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families that overstayed visas.

The bishops' assembly opened with a Sunday night Mass celebrated by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the conference. In his sermon, Parolin urged the bishops to dispel ""the shadows of polarization, divisiveness and societal breakdown by the pure light of the Gospel.""

The Vatican provided no information about Parolin's trip in the U.S. On Monday, he met with Vice President Mike Pence, according to a White House news release, which said the men discussed issues including religious freedom, human trafficking and the plight of Christian and other religious minorities in Iraq and Syria. Parolin told the Catholic TV network EWTN that he and Pence also discussed the church's position on the need for a ""compassionate approach to the issue of migration."" The White House news release did not mention immigration.

The 68-million-member U.S. Catholic church, the country's largest denomination by far, runs a nationwide network of support programs for refugees and immigrants. Immigrants comprise a large share of church members, including a growing presence of Latinos, both newcomers and U.S.-born parishioners. Pope Francis has made aid for immigrants and refugees a priority of his pontificate.

DiNardo linked the church's advocacy for immigrants with the Roman Catholic teaching against abortion, saying respect for others begins in the womb. He also called for stronger religious liberty protections for health care workers and others who oppose abortion.

Several bishops said the precarious situation for immigrants was the result of inaction by several presidential administrations that did not enact comprehensive immigration reform. Still, church leaders noted that animosity toward immigrants has intensified over the past year or so.

Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich said ""that poisoning rhetoric"" is having an impact on parishioners. Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski, referencing the Trump campaign slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" said, ""We can make America great, but you don't make America great by making America mean.""

Along with advocating for immigrants, the bishops have started a new initiative against racism, which has had a ""troubling resurgence,"" said Bishop George Murry, of Youngston, Ohio.","Catholic cardinal condemns ""forces of division"" and fear",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/13/catholic-cardinal-condemns-forces-division-and-fear.html

He may be unaware that ""trickle-down economics"" is the pejorative label that Democrats slapped on Ronald Reagan’s approach to taxes.

The core of the political argument is whether or not the middle class is getting a tax cut, as the administration contends. The New York Times, in its own analysis, says no: ""Nearly half of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026 than they would under current rules if the proposed House tax bill became law, and about one-third would pay more in 2018.""

If the projects by the Times and other groups are right, it will be easier for critics to brand the effort as mainly helping the wealthy.

Senate Republicans complicated matters yesterday by pushing ahead with a plan that differs from the House, since they would have to be reconciled as the clock keeps ticking. The Ways and Means panel passed the House bill yesterday.","Kurtz: Republicans, Under Pressure After Election Losses, Struggle with Tax Reform",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/10/kurtz-republicans-under-pressure-after-election-losses-struggle-tax-reform#commenting

The killer, Devin Kelley, was shooting the wounded when Willeford showed up with a rifle. Willeford’s quick actions forced Kelley to stop his attack, presumably saving the lives of the twenty wounded and possibly many more.

The press derided President Trump for saying that Willeford saved many lives with his gun, and that stricter gun control regulations would have only made things worse.

It is only too bad that someone with a concealed handgun permit wasn’t already at the church. We may never have heard of the shooting — national news stories are virtually never done on permit holders stopping mass public shootings.

An article at Fox News this past week mentions four such cases. It talks about a 1997 shooting at a high school in Pearl, Mississippi; a 2007 church attack in Colorado Springs; and a Chicago Uber driver who in 2015 shot and wounded a man who opened fire on a crowd. The most recent case was a 2017 church shooting in Antioch, Tennessee. But those cases just skim the surface.

A 2014 FBI report claims that only once between 2000 and 2013 did a concealed handgun permit holder stop a public shooting (they claimed to look at all cases where guns were fired in public that weren’t part of a gang fight or some other crime). This single case occurred in Winnemucca, Nevada in May 2008, when a customer with a permit fatally shot an attacker who had just killed two people. They didn’t even include the 2007 church shooting in Colorado Springs, where a killer had already taken two lives at the church before being stopped by a permit holder.

A 2014 FBI report claims that only once between 2000 and 2013 did a concealed handgun permit holder stop a public shooting. This false claim just shows how politicized the FBI became under the Obama administration.

This false claim just shows how politicized the FBI became under the Obama administration. Many times, police, sheriffs, and prosecutors have gone on the record and credited permit holders with saving many lives. These attacks didn’t get national news attention, but they would have been on front pages everywhere if a permit holder hadn’t intervened.

There are countless examples of people using guns in self-defense at their homes or workplaces. But I want to focus on a much narrower set of cases where permit holders stopped public shootings. Here are 10 additional recent cases.

-- Arlington, Texas, May 3, 2017: A police spokesman stated that the concealed handgun permit holder “prevented further loss of life.” A Dallas Morning News headline read: “‘Hero’ stopped mass murder by crazed bar patron who was armed to the teeth, police say.”

-- Lyman, South Carolina, June 30, 2016: Just a couple of weeks after the Orlando massacre, 32-year-old Jody Ray Thompson opened fire on another nightclub. Fortunately, permitted concealed handguns were allowed in South Carolina bars. Thompson was able to shoot three people before the permit holder fired back and wounded Thompson in the leg. Fox 5 in Atlanta reports: “At least one South Carolina sheriff are crediting a man with a concealed carry permit with preventing further violence at a nightclub this past Sunday.”

-- Winton, Ohio, July 26, 2015: A man started shooting at four people who were walking outside on a summer’s evening. Fortunately, a concealed handgun permit holder fired at the attacker, giving the four people a chance to escape into their home.

-- Conyers, Georgia, May 31, 2015: A man killed two people at a liquor store and continued shooting at others until a permit holder ran inside and exchanged fire. The killer then fled the store. “I believe that if Mr. Scott did not return fire at the suspect then more of those customers would have [been] hit by a gun,” said Rockdale County Sheriff Eric Levett. “So in my opinion he saved other lives in that store.”

-- New Holland, South Carolina, May 5, 2015: New Holland Fire Department volunteers were hosting a children’s day event with ice cream and fire truck rides, when a man started shooting. Fortunately, two firemen were permit holders and were able to stop the attack.

-- Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 22, 2015: A 40-year-old man started shooting at people in a barber shop. A permit holder who heard the gunfire ran inside and shot the attacker. “The person who responded was a legal gun permit carrier. He responded and I guess he saved a lot of people in there,” said Philadelphia Police Captain Frank Llewellyn.

-- Darby, Pennsylvania, July 24, 2014: Convicted felon Richard Plotts killed a caseworker at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital and started shooting at Dr. Lee Silverman. Fortunately, the doctor had his own gun and returned fire, critically wounding Plotts, who still had 39 bullets on him. “Without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives,” said Yeadon police chief Donald Molineux.

-- Chicago, Illinois, July 7, 2014: Gang members started firing at four people who had just left a party. The attack started because one of the four people removed a cup of liquor that had been placed on top of her vehicle. Luckily, one of the four people — a military member — had a permitted concealed handgun and was able to wound the primary attacker.

-- Portland, Oregon, January 11, 2014: Convicted criminal Thomas Eliot Hjelmeland was ejected from a nightclub but returned 30 minutes later wearing a mask and carrying a gun. He shot the bouncer who had ejected him, and shot at others. Two others were wounded, and Hjelmeland was shooting all around the club. A concealed handgun permit holder who worked at the nightclub then fatally shot Hjelmeland.

And here are just two more cases from 2000 to 2013 — the same period that the FBI claims only had one instance of a permit holder stopping a public shooting. Again, law enforcement say that permit holders saved lives in both of these cases.

-- Plymouth, Pennsylvania, September 9, 2012: William Allabaugh shot at people as he walked down the street in Plymouth, Pennsylvania. He wounded one and killed another. Permit holder Mark Ktytor fatally shot Allabaugh. “Mr. [Ktytor] then acted, taking him [Allabaugh] down. We believe that it could have been much worse that night,” said Luzerne County Assistant District Attorney Jarrett Ferentino.

-- Spartanburg, South Carolina, March 2012: Jesse Gates kicked open a door to a church and pointed a shotgun at the pastor and congregation. Parishioner Aaron Guyton, a concealed weapons permit holder, got the drop on Gates and held him at gunpoint. Sheriff Chuck Wright called Aaron and others at the church “everyday heroes.”

Permit holders haven't just stopped public shootings. They have stopped everything from public knife attacks to vehicle attacks.

I haven't found a single case where gun control advocates' fears were borne out by the facts. In not one of these cases did a permit holder accidentally shoot a bystander, or a police officer accidentally harm a permit holder.

There are many more of these cases. Imagine how different the gun control debate would be if some of these heroic permit holders got national coverage. But even the liquor store shooting in Conyers, Georgia couldn’t get national coverage, despite being caught on video.

The more you learn about these cases, the more you appreciate that mass public shooters have good reason to keep attacking gun-free zones. These killers might be crazy, but they aren’t stupid. They realize that the longer it takes for a good guy to arrive with a gun, the more people they can kill.",Good guys with guns saving lives,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/12/good-guys-with-guns-saving-lives.html

“You are a terrible human being,” wrote one.

“Are you really that ignorant?” another said.

As previously reported, Handler chose to end her Netflix talk show recently after just two rocky seasons in an effort to focus on political activism.

“Like so many across the country, the past presidential election and the countless events that have unfolded since have galvanized me. From the national level down to the grassroots, it’s clear our decisions at the ballot box next year will mark a defining moment for our nation,” she wrote in a statement at the time. “For these reasons, I’ve decided not to return for another season of Chelsea, and instead devote as much time as I can to becoming a more knowledgeable and engaged citizen and to focus on projects that have significance to me.”

Chances are that you hardly notice it half the time, but it might change colors or hurt a little if something’s not quite right. Take a look at a few health problems that your tongue might be telling you about.

First of all, a healthy tongue will have a light pink color to it and be covered with tiny bumps called papillae.

PARENTS OF 10-MONTH-OLD BOY WHO WEIGHS AS MUCH AS A 9-YEAR-OLD SEEK HELP

You won’t usually see a strong color or spots and dots coating a normal tongue, and you definitely shouldn’t feel tingling, burning or pain. If you do, these could be signs of a health problem that you’ll want to look into.

Common Tongue Problems:

Fortunately, tongue problems have specific characteristics that help you zero in on the true health issue. You might see:

Strawberry Red

What it means: Unless you just ate a carton of strawberries or a lollipop, a bright red tongue is not a normal color. There’s a few possibilities that might be causing it.

Vitamin deficiency – Your tongue might be turning a shiny red because it’s losing taste buds. This happens when you’re not getting enough of certain vitamins, namely B-12, folic acid or iron. You’ll need to supplement or eat more foods that contain these vitamins to solve the problem.

Scarlet fever – If you’re red tongue is accompanying a high fever, you should get checked for this bacterial condition. You might see scarlet fever pop up with strep throat.

Chronic dryness – If you have an overly dry mouth, you might see an abnormal red. In this case, you’ll just need to take care of the symptoms with over-the-counter or prescription medications.

White All Over

What it means: If you’re noticing what looks like a lumpy blanket of white all over your tongue, you may have a yeast infection (or oral thrush).

Most of the time, oral thrush happens because too many good bacteria are killed by antibiotics, letting yeast take over instead. You do need to see your doctor for prescription anti-fungal medication.

White patches

What it means: You might notice a painless white patch on or underneath your tongue, a spot called leukoplakia. For the most part, you don’t have anything to worry about.

5 SUBTLE SIGNS OF KIDNEY CANCER

However, especially if you’re a smoker, these white spots can be a form of pre-cancer, warning you to take precautions. Be sure to get any abnormal patches cleared by a doctor.

Cracks or wrinkles

What it means: Concerned about deep cracks in the middle or sides of your tongue? What about wrinkles or ridges? You shouldn’t fret over these pesky ridges that often get more pronounced with age.

In themselves, they’re usually harmless. However, you may develop infections if you don’t clean thoroughly enough and if the ridges are deep. Get any abnormal symptoms checked out, such as a foul smell or tongue pain.

Painful sores

What it means: If you have a painful sore in your mouth, it’s likely a canker sore, or mouth ulcer. They’re usually round, shallow and mostly white with a red rim.

If left alone, they usually heal themselves within two weeks, but you’ll want to stay away from spicy or acidic foods until then. Experts don’t know exactly why canker sores happen, but many think that they’re related to stress or damage to mouth tissue.

Red bumps

What it means: Sometimes, you might notice red bumps forming underneath your tongue or on the top or sides. While bumps on the top may be an inflammation of the papillae, red bumps that don’t go away could be a sign of oral cancer. Treat them seriously and schedule a medical evaluation.

Black or brown hair

What it means: Are you worried that your tongue is turning into a hairy monster? The black or brown fuzz is actually not hair. It happens when cells on your tongue multiply before your body can shed them, and then they trap in bacteria from food or drinks more easily.

At the same time, the bacteria growth is likely due to poor hygiene but sometimes signifies poorly managed diabetes or antibiotic overuse. Make sure that you’re brushing your tongue and your teeth several times per day to get rid of the problem.

IS IT BROKEN OR SPRAINED? WHEN TO SEEK HELP

Your tongue says a lot about your health and can signal you of underlying problems like infection or poor hygiene. Normally, you won’t notice anything out the ordinary, but you might see a change in color or feel some pain if something’s wrong. The next time you’re brushing your teeth, take a look at your tongue in the mirror and hear what it has to tell you about your health.

Hill, 50, revealed the couple had friends in attendance at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Oct. 1 when Stephen Paddock opened fire from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58 people and wounding nearly 500 others.

The YOLO culture divides people against the each other.","The recent Texas church shooting, the terrorist driving a truck through a crowd in New York City, and the Las Vegas massacre may seem shocking – but to anyone who has been paying attention, they should not.

Our culture is undergoing a hostile takeover. American society used to be governed by Judeo-Christian do-unto-others morals. But we have drifted (been pushed, really) into a hedonistic YOLO (You Only Live Once) cultural morass. The upshot of this is a distinct lack of respect for human life in general, as well as a pervasive, insidious obsession with self.

This is the “me” generation, the “selfie” culture, the “entitlement” mentality. And what is entitlement, except the narcissistic assumption of deserving and demanding what is not earned?

Our cultural crisis is exhibited by egotistic multimillionaires demonstrating on football fields against the police instead of seeking solutions to rampant inner-city violence; coddled young people demanding free birth control and socialized health care; and even the major media ignoring the corruption trial of Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

No amount of self-love can fill the God-shaped hole in someone’s heart. We are created and called to love each other, and no self-absorbed spa treatment or Instagram post can supplant our innate yearning for love from God.

Another example of the crisis is the lack of attention the mainstream media are paying to the Clintons’ collusion to sell Russia 20 percent of U.S. uranium.

We’ve replaced our moral imperative to do what’s right with a personal obsession of what’s in it for ME?

But no amount of self-love can fill the God-shaped hole in someone’s heart. We are created and called to love each other, and no self-absorbed spa treatment or Instagram post can supplant our innate yearning for love from God.

The spirit of our time is gradually revealing in our culture a subversive, resolute, and increasing hatred toward God and Christianity, and an irresistible temptation toward evil that betrays man’s innate desire for power: a longing to be God.

The Harvey Weinsteins of the world (and they are myriad, both in Hollywood and out) seek to force others to do their will, much like they envision a capricious God would be, if they believed in such a being.

It is much easier, however, to deny God than to acknowledge him. God, being good, condemns evil-doers. So, like a child throwing a tantrum in a toy store, some people must deny the existence of God and his inherent goodness, and lord their power over weaker people. “I can make you watch me shower.”

Society, still trading in our inherited moral capital, might verbally condemn the behavior. But that’s just lip-service, because we’ve succumbed to the YOLO moral relativism and forgotten our metric for right and wrong.

“I forbid you to see me as a sex object,” screamed the gal in the pink hat! And those who claim they wanted to expose the bully – and they all say that now – confess they were too afraid of retribution. Translation: I like my money and position more than I believe in right and wrong. “Followers” on social media beat morals every day of the week in YOLO land.

When a righteous dad wanted to expose a high-powered elitist climbing in bed with youngsters, the Hollywood leftists and atheists sided with the pedophile over the conservative. Status is more important than virtue in YOLO land.

The growing YOLO culture seeks to silence the stalwart dissent of facts. Feelings are more important than truth in YOLO land.

Threatened by disagreement and privilege, yelling triumphs over logic. The YOLO culture seeks not content of character, but equality of outcome. Hatred is so much easier than forgiveness.

Self-destructive loathing and jealousy stems from the hypocrisy that started in kindergarten, when children are taught: You are an accident of nature, and survival of the fittest is the law of the land. Now, don’t bully.

And so, they distrust the dark abyss of irreligion, even as they embrace it.

Attacks against the only one who preached forgiveness and grace, goodness and love – and any who support him – will increase: He challenges the YOLO worldview taught in public school.

As it becomes more and more costly to be an adherent of Christianity, with stories of the persecution of bakers, florists, teachers, and T-shirt makers splashing across newspapers every day, the truth gathers defenders.

Though meant to intimidate us, these stories do the opposite. They galvanize Christians to stand firm in the light of understanding, and the peace that surpasses it.

The people who still trade in the Judeo-Christian ethic of “love one another” and “life has value” are not called simply to defend their position, but to fight for it, before the overwhelming tide of YOLO selfishness inundates us with the intolerance and bigotry integral to the religion of self.

The YOLO culture divides people against the each other.

To survive and prosper as a nation, we must reaffirm our Judeo-Christian heritage, indivisible, under God. Because if you only live once, it’s survival of the fittest, and it’s all about you, then laws are meaningless.",Our culture is experiencing a hostile takeover.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff, who is leading House Democrats’ inquisition into Trump-Russia collusion, has not given up on proving that his party’s financed, Kremlin-sourced dossier is true.

The Californian pressed his case again this month during a long closed hearing with former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page to try to revive what had become dormant charges of criminal conduct.

Mr. Schiff, who on Wednesday labeled President Trump “the worst president in modern history,” previously said that one of his main objectives for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigation is to find which dossier parts are true.

In the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election last year, Mr. Schiff and his Democratic colleagues since January have been more than willing to cite the dossier’s paid unidentified Kremlin sources to attack the Trump administration.

Christopher Langer, 31, was allegedly intoxicated and arguing with his parents just after 4 p.m. on Sunday when he said he placed explosive substances in a grenade, police said. His parents called police on the domestic disturbance, who responded to the call and contacted the bomb squad, prompting a more than 13-hour investigation.

“It was a tale of two homes,” Volusia Sheriff Michael Chitwood said at a news conference on Monday. “When you first walk in, you say, ‘I can’t believe someone is in here making bombs.’ And then you go into his room, which is absolutely deplorable that if I was a roach I wouldn’t want to live in that room.”

He added, “That was how despicable, feces and urine-filled, that room was.”

Langer initially denied having a grenade, but then admitted he threw it outside and offered to lead investigators to it. A deputy found a pineapple-like grenade with a paperclip that prevented it from detonating, police said. Langer had allegedly purchased it at a supply store.

About 200 other containers were discovered inside the home. They contained unknown powders and acids — including nitric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfur — and other materials. Most of the bottles contained bodily fluids, not bomb-making materials that the bomb squad initially suspected.

Two other explosive devices were found and rendered safe. A fourth device also was being examined.

Chitwood told reporters he believed Langer was working on a delivery system and building a bomb. A SpongeBob SquarePants lunch box was found that appeared to be “booby-trapped” for an explosive device.

Langer was known to officials, who saved his life about two weeks ago when he overdosed on heroin. He was revived with Narcan, Chitwood said. Psychedelic mushrooms and marijuana were found growing in the home.

Langer told the bomb squad he is anti-government, against the system and was looking to “get even” by harming first responders, Chitwood said. He added Langer had a “white mask” associated with a group, though Chitwood did not name the specific organization.

Langer’s parents told police they didn’t know their son was planning an attack or making explosive devices in their house.

Langer was arrested on charges of making and possessing a destructive device, but could face additional charges. He was held on $5,000 bail.","Florida man had grenade, explosive devices in parents' house, police say",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/11/13/florida-man-had-grenade-explosive-devices-in-parents-house-police-say.html

Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals.","Last Saturday night, Callista and I had the great privilege of attending the Marine Corps Ball in Rome, Italy. The event commemorated the 242nd birthday of the United States Marine Corps, and we were lucky to have arrived in Rome in time to attend.

Former Private First Class Harold Blunk was the guest speaker. In May 1968, during the Vietnam War, he played a major role in the brutal battle for Foxtrot Ridge. This melee was part of the larger battle for Khe Sanh (one of the largest set piece battles with the North Vietnamese Army in the entire war).

Private Blunk’s role was powerfully captured in the citation written for the Silver Star he was awarded for the indisputable valor and bravery he exhibited in the face of combat:

""In spite of the withering enemy fire, he continued to call in fire missions, adjust the fire around the perimeter, and coordinate the adjustments with the forward observer in the company command post. Throughout the hours of darkness, he and his fellow Marines repelled numerous enemy attacks on their position. Private First Class Blunk's leadership and courage in the face of overwhelming odds rallied his fellow Marines and was decisive in their holding the ‘Crow's Nest.’ With ammunition running critically low, he and another Marine left their besieged perimeter on more than one occasion to collect enemy weapons and ammunition to continue their fight against the enemy.""

Now, 49 years later, Harold Blunk is a successful businessman and active citizen, who is delighted to visit Marine celebrations and remind younger Marines of the bond of courage and sacrifice which binds them all together.

With Veterans Day approaching, I couldn't help but think of Harold and other veterans I have known and who have helped shape my life. Here are a few:

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared...

My stepfather, Bob Gingrich, served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He spent 27 years in the Army and felt he was serving a cause larger than himself. Much of my devotion to and passion for public service grew from the example he set and his attitude and habits.

Callista had four uncles who served in World War II. Three served in Europe and made it home. Uncle Louie served in the Pacific and was killed in the last months of the war. He is buried on Luzon.

One of the most decent men I ever worked with was the late Republican leader Bob Michel. He landed in Normandy and fought his way across France. In the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest in 1944, he was in a foxhole when a German sniper killed the man next to him. He always wondered why he had been spared, and felt God wanted him to devote his life to serving others.

One of the most amazing men I have worked with is former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Severely wounded in Italy in the last months of World War II, he spent more than three years in rehabilitation hospitals. Bob then forced himself to get well enough to earn a law degree, run for office, and serve 27 years in Congress. He eventually became Senate Majority Leader and a Republican Presidential nominee. Today, at 94 years old, Bob Dole still goes to work every day.

Our freedom, prosperity, and safety depend on the bravery and loyalty of veterans like these and the monumental sacrifices they make for our country. We are infinitely grateful for their service, as well as for the support and countless sacrifices made by their families, who often spend long periods, periods of intense worrying, without their loved ones.

This Veterans Day is a good time to remind ourselves how much we owe the brave men and women who make great sacrifices to defend America and our freedoms.

To all of our veterans and those who continue to serve our country, thank you for your dedication and service.

By Cleta Mitchell and Hans von Spakovsky, The Wall Street Journal



Donna Brazile has confirmed Bernie Sanders’s worst suspicions. Ms. Brazile, who served as interim chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the fall 2016 campaign, says in a new book that during the primaries, the DNC was controlled by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Ms. Brazile claims the arrangement was “not illegal,” but that is far from clear.

Ms. Brazile reports that when she arrived on the job in July 2016, Gary Gensler, the campaign’s chief financial officer, told her the DNC was fully under the control of the campaign. In September 2015, 10 months before Mrs. Clinton’s nomination, the party had moved its bank account to the same bank in New York used by the Clinton campaign and created a joint fundraising committee, the Hillary Victory Fund, whose treasurer, bank account, and control were vested in the campaign.

Then, in an August 2015 memorandum of understanding, the DNC essentially handed over its operations to the Clinton campaign for the next 15 months.

The purpose of joint fundraising committees is to allow more than one entity to collaborate in raising money and share in the costs. Each participant is subject to federal contribution limits. When the party itself is a participant, its committee (in this case the DNC) normally handles accounting and financial controls. Not here. The Hillary Victory Fund was controlled by the Clinton campaign, with a campaign employee as treasurer and the fund’s bank account established at the Clinton campaign’s bank. According to Federal Election Commission reports, the Hillary Victory Fund has raised more than $526 million.

The DNC asserted its “neutrality” by also entering into a joint fundraising committee with the Sanders campaign. It raised a total of $1,000. And the Bernie Victory Committee treasurer was the DNC’s designee.

“Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state,” Ms. Brazile writes, “but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn”—i.e., Clinton headquarters. She says state parties raised $82 million, of which they kept less than 0.5%.","Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Law",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/13/hillary-clinton-dnc-and-law

So, it took quite a bit to get me to boycott the NFL, but they managed it. Until the owners require their players to stand for the national anthem, or sit for the game, I won’t watch a minute, and I’m not alone.

Since Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the anthem in a misguided protest against police violence, the NFL has been hemorrhaging fans. Both TV viewership and attendance at stadiums are well down and once people find other ways to spend their Sundays, they may not come back.

Let there be no doubt, the NFL is a business and the owners of those billion dollar plus franchises have a problem. A bunch of their players want to play social justice games, but their core audience, the folks who pay the bills, just want them to play football. And we really don’t like the disrespect shown to the anthem, the flag and those who fought for our country including those who came home in coffins with that flag draped over them.

This Veterans Day weekend there was quite a duality. The NFL went whole hog saluting the military and trying to mend fences. Historically the league, and most of the players, have been very supportive of the military. Part of that was the tens of millions of tax dollars the military paid them to put on displays with the flag and flyovers for the recruiting value, but there was also a genuine bond for the most part.

But at the same time there was a push to boycott the NFL. I did my part on social media:

Like many others, seeing a bunch of pampered millionaires stealing the moment when we should all come together in thanks for the freedoms we enjoy, and yes for those who safeguard them, well that just flat pisses me off.

They say the protests are not against the anthem or the flag or the military for that matter. But that is garbage because the effect is to disrespect all of those things so they can virtue signal their solidarity with the radical left. They could do their social justice pandering whenever they want, and they made a conscious choice. By choosing to put the spotlight on themselves instead of the symbols of what makes this country great.

That just doesn’t sit well with those of us who served, or have family who did or who just want to enjoy a football game without politics. We get plenty of bitter arguments and displays of partisanship all day every day. Football was a time to forget all that and just remember how much the Bears still suck. They took that and even worse did so with divisive anti-police grievance mongering to a crowd with a heavy component of Blue Lives Matters sentiment.

But in an interview with shock jock Howard Stern recorded just weeks ago, Takei appeared to admit that he had grabbed and groped people in the past, saying he did it to “persuade” people who were “afraid” to have a sexual encounter with him.

Former model Scott R. Brunton claimed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he was 23 when he exchanged phone numbers with Takei at a bar, later visiting the actor’s house for drinks.

He said he grew dizzy and “must have passed out,” waking to his pants around his ankles and Takei groping him. He said he extricated himself and left.

“Right now it is a he said/he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful,” Takei tweeted in response to the allegations.

The ""Star Trek"" star makes regular appearances on radio heavyweight Stern’s show, and recently chatted with Stern and co-host Robin Quivers in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal.

In a frequently explicit discussion, Stern asked Takei if he’d ever grabbed somebody “against their will” — and the actor’s response made the radio host joke that he might need to call the police.

Below is a transcript:

Howard Stern: Did you ever grab anybody by the c--k against their will?

[Very long pause]

George Takei: Uhhhh ... uh oh! [laughter]

Stern: Well they were different times, you never sexually harassed anybody... have you?

Takei: [Laughter] ... Some people that are kind of, um, um, skittish. Or maybe, uh ... afraid. And you’re trying to persuade. But, you know ...

Stern: Do we need to call the police? What are you saying, George? You never held a job over someone if they didn’t touch your c--k?

Takei: No, no, no, no. I never did that. That’s what this is all about. It’s not about sex, it’s about power.

Robin Quivers: But you didn’t do this grabbing at work?

Takei: Oh no, no, no. It was never at work. They came to my home.

Stern: Maybe it was some guy who was hesitating to have sex with you and you gave him a gentle squeeze on the b---s or something?

Takei: ... More than gentle [laughter]. But it didn’t involve power over the other.

Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller charged 12 additional men in the case, bringing the total number of former Beta Theta Pi brothers and pledges being charged to 17 in total.

Timothy Piazza, 19, of Lebanon, N.J., fell down a set of stairs and suffered fatal injuries on Feb. 9 after prosecutors said pledges were forced to down a dangerous amount of alcohol and were then made to run a “gauntlet” of booze-drinking stations.

The charges come from surveillance video that allegedly showed various members of the fraternity giving Piazza 18 alcoholic beverages in the span of 1 hour and 22 minutes, Parks Miller said.

The video was deleted after fraternity members were made aware that an investigation into Piazza’s death was under way, and police planned to obtain the footage.

The basement video captured the ongoing hazing that occurred on bid acceptance night, and the continued repeated furnishing of alcohol by Beta brothers to Piazza, as well as the other pledges, throughout the evening.

""In fact, on video, Tim Piazza does not obtain his own alcohol at any point-rather, every drink consumed was provided to him by a fraternity brother,"" her office said in a news release.

""Hazing needs to stop, there's just no place for it."" - Jim Piazza, father of former Penn State Student Timothy Piazza

Parks Miller said FBI agents were able to restore the surveillance video from the deleted hard drive in the basement of the house.

""People had asked us before, why would somebody had delete that video if they did delete it? That's what we wanted to know,"" she said. ""Well know we know, because it contained criminal conduct.”

PROSECUTORS REFILE CHARGES AGAINST 11 IN PENN STATE FRAT HAZING DEATH

Last month, prosecutors announced they moved to reinstate most of the dismissed charges against 11 members of the now-defunct Penn State fraternity for actions related to the hazing death of the sophomore pledge earlier this year.

Parks Miller announced the refiling of criminal charges, including involuntary manslaughter and felony aggravated assault, after District Justice Allen Sinclair threw out the felony charges in September against eight Beta Thea Pi fraternity members, her office said in a press release.

The judge let stand lesser charges against them and six others, but dismissed other charges altogether against four of the members of the fraternity. As a result, those defendants again face the possibility of several years in prison, if convicted.

Security video of the incident recorded Piazza appearing intoxicated and being led to a couch after 11 p.m. A few minutes later, he fell head-first down a set of basement stairs and had to be carried back up in an unconscious state.

For several hours, members of the fraternity appeared to tend to their injured friend, pouring liquid on him and strapping on a loaded backpack to prevent him from rolling over and choking on vomit. He died two days later on Feb. 4 at a local hospital.



""Hazing needs to stop, there's just no place for it,"" Timothy Piazza's father Jim said at a news conference.

Penn State said last week it punished seven students in connection with Piazza's death who were found to be in violation of the university's student code of conduct.

Penalties ranged from probation to expulsion, the school said, but it did not give a breakdown, citing student privacy.

Violations included ""hazing"" and ""creating a condition that endangers,"" the school said. It did not identify the students.

Another 19 students withdrew before completing the disciplinary process and must complete it before returning to Penn State, the school said. Six students participated in the process and were not charged with any violations.

Prosecutors on Monday charged with Ryan Liam Burke, Bo Han Sang, Joshua Robert Kurczewski, Aiden O’Brien and Jonathan Kanzler with felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter for their alleged roles in the events that led to Piazza’s death in February. The five were also also charged with misdemeanor simple assault, misdemeanor recklessly endangering another person, misdemeanor hazing and misdemeanor furnishing liquor to a minor, according to the DA.

In addition to the five, Joseph Ems, Brian Gelb, Patrick Jackson, Reggie Goeke, Donald Prior and Mike Fernandez were charged with misdemeanor hazing and misdemeanor furnishing alcohol to minors.

Prosecutors also filed charges against Braxton Becker with tampering with evidence, obstructing administration of the law and hindering apprehension for allegedly trying to destroy the recording.

Even still, those angered by the untidy bun have argued that, just because the white model’s tousled look works, it doesn’t mean the same aesthetic can be achieved on textured hair.

In response, some said that the overconcern with “edging” is a Eurofication of black hair, and that leaving it alone is a better solution.

Gen. George S. Patton was one of the most fascinating military figures to dominate the last century. Quite simply, he was a genius for war.

But at 11:45 on the morning of December 9, 1945, Gen. Patton was en route to a pheasant hunt near Mannheim, Germany, when his Cadillac staff car suddenly collided with a two-and-a-half ton U.S. Army truck. Twelve days later, the four-star general -- who had triumphed against Hitler's best from North Africa to Europe -- was dead. The Army concluded it was merely a traffic accident, but others believe it was an assassination attempt.

On VE Day May 8, 1945, American GIs were ready to return home. But George Patton wanted to keep fighting. The always-outspoken general was vocal about who his new enemy was: the Russians. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower disagreed, and so did many others in Washington.

In this episode of ""War Stories Investigates with Oliver North,"" we'll explore the rumors, myths and conspiracy theories surrounding Patton's mysterious accident and death. We will also explore the highlights of his military career with members of his family.

Patton had planned to leave Germany and return home and retire. Strangely, he was the only one injured in the crash. The official Army accident report is still missing. You'll hear a firsthand account from Patton's driver that day, PFC Horace Woodring. You'll also hear from military author Robert Wilcox, who claims that the accident was staged by American and Russian intelligence and says he knows who killed Patton. And meet nurse Lt.

Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.
Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.","You don’t have to be a cable news or Twitter junkie like me to know that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is in serious trouble.

The Washington Post revealed Thursday that Moore has been accused of sexual misconduct by four women, including one woman who was just 14 when the 32-year old Moore allegedly assaulted her. That’s the definition of pedophilia for those who are on the fence. And Monday we heard a statement from Beverly Young Nelson, who alleges that Moore assaulted her when she was just 16, telling her “if you tell anyone about this no one will believe you.”

The other women in the Washington Post story were in their teens so I’m hard pressed to consider the 14-year old Moore’s one big mistake. His ex-colleague said it was “common knowledge” that Moore “dated high school girls” into his 30s and would hang around high school football games and the mall. You’d think a legal mind as great as Moore would have better things to do, but I digress.

I’m sure you’ve already read a bunch of pieces on the attempt to discredit these women by using the phrase “if true” before any statement about Moore’s alleged activities. And you’ve probably seen the faux outrage over Jerry Seinfeld’s relationship with a 17-year old or my personal favorite that JFK had an affair with 19-year old Mimi Alford when he was 45.

My suggestion is that no one vote for Jerry Seinfeld if he runs for public office. As for JFK, you can also not vote for him if he somehow comes back from the dead.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden.

When you get into the realm of Bill Clinton’s accusers things inevitably get trickier, but the good news there is that there are no Clintons left on any ballots, including the one who never has been accused of assaulting anyone.

It looks like Alabamans are skeptical of Moore’s protestations, just like Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is. He said that he believes the women and Moore should step aside. So does the chair of the Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who says Moore should withdraw and if he doesn’t, and he wins, then the Senate should expel him.

The first two polls conducted since the allegations broke shows Democrat Doug Jones ahead by four points – a 12-point reversal in one of them.

Moore is busy furiously fundraising off this “fake news” accusation and Democrats are stepping up all over the country for Jones. Prominent Senators like Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chris Murphy are all working their social channels and phones for Jones. And their followers are doing their part, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the insurgent campaign.

Democrats won’t stop. But I sincerely hope they will continue to back Jones from afar.

Top Democrat brass should take note: if Tuesday’s wins felt as good for you as they did for me and you’d like to be the winning team again, stay out of Alabama. Let Doug Jones do his thing on his own terms.

If he has to trash Nancy Pelosi, so be it. If he has to say that Hillary Clinton was the wrong candidate for this election and Joe Biden would’ve won, so it goes. If he has to say that the Democrat primary was rigged and Bernie never had a chance, that’s how the cookie crumbles. And if he has to say that the media is biased, let it slide.

Our leadership isn’t popular and it is especially unpopular in Alabama. Unless Jones leads a rally chant of “lock her up,” we’re all good.

So cancel any trips down south unless you’ve got bipartisan appeal and are named Joe Biden and host a fundraiser for Jones in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago or just about anywhere else than Mobile.

More than 400 people were on the steamer Itata when it sank in a ferocious storm off the coast of La Higuera in Chile’s Coquimbo region. Some 374 people died in the disaster, according to news reports.

HUNLEY MYSTERY SOLVED: BLAST FROM OWN TORPEDO LIKELY KILLED CREW

The wreck’s location has remained a mystery since the Itata sank on Aug. 28, 1922. A few weeks ago, experts from Chile’s Catholic University of the North (UCN) and Matthias Gorny, director of science for ocean conservation group Oceana thought that they had found the spot where the ferry boat sank, but were unable to find the Itata’s wreck using a robot sub. The breakthrough came a few days later when the wreckage was spotted at a depth of 200 metres (656 feet).

In a statement translated via Google Translate, Carlos Cortés, a filmmaker and marine biologist at the UCN and leader of the expedition, heralded the discovery as a “great achievement,” noting that the Itata is a crucial part of Chile’s underwater heritage.

The University is planning to launch a documentary on the incredible find. Experts are also working on permits to conduct archaeological surveys of the site and seeking additional funding for their research.

Cortés launched the search for Itata seven years ago with audiovisual producer Ricardo Bordones. Oceana played a key role in finding the doomed vessel. Experts knew that Itata sank off the Chilean coast somewhere between Punta de Choros and Caleta Chungungo, an area that the ocean conservation group knows well.

“We have made several scientific expeditions off the coast of La Higuera due to the environmental importance of this place,” said Gorny, in the statement. “Therefore, we wanted to collaborate in the search for Itata, taking advantage of the technology we have, and thanks to the images of our underwater robot, we were able to confirm that what was there was the ship's remains.”

The Faculty of Marine Sciences at UCN will continue investigating the wreck using a robot sub. The Itata site on the Pacific seabed opens up a host of research opportunities in areas such as underwater archaeology, history and marine biology, according to Javier Sellanes, the Faculty’s research secretary. “All this will continue to be done with the corresponding permits and due respect for those who lost their lives in this tragic event and their families,” he said, in the statement.

The storied ship was used by rebels during the 1891 Chilean Civil War and was involved in a diplomatic incident between the U.S. and Chile over a shipment of arms.

Bob Menendez’s corruption case were ordered to continue deliberations despite telling the judge Monday they were deadlocked in the trial of the Democratic senator accused of taking bribes for political favors.

In a note to U.S .District Judge William Walls, jurors wrote they “can’t reach a unanimous verdict.” Walls sent the 12-person panel home for the day but instructed deliberations to continue on Tuesday.

The case against Menendez has taken several frustrating turns.

Jurors have been told repeatedly not to read reports about the case.

Four jurors and three alternates told Walls they had heard or read something about the trial over the weekend. He questioned them individually in his chambers.

Last week, Walls dismissed juror Evelyn Arroyo-Maultsby so she could go on vacation with her family. That prompted the judge to tell the new jury — made up of seven women and five men — to begin fresh deliberations.

Panelists also asked Walls for the definition of a senator. The federal judge refused to answer.

He also declined a juror’s request last Monday for a transcript of the closing argument by Abbe Lowell, Menendez’s attorney.



Walls told jurors they would need to rely on their memories.

The case marks the first time in almost a decade that a sitting U.S. senator faced a federal bribery charge.

According to the criminal complaint, the New Jersey Democrat greased the wheels for Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist.

Among other things, Menendez was accused of helping obtain visas for several of Melgen’s girlfriends as well as lobby the State Department on his behalf regarding a $500 million port security contract in the Dominican Republic.

Melgen, in turn, paid for private jets, hotel rooms and forked over nearly $75,000 in campaign contributions to Menendez.



Even though a bribery conviction doesn’t mean Menendez would be forced to resign, the 63-year-old lawmaker likely would face intense pressure to step down.

A recent Fox News poll found that a majority of voters think Menendez should resign immediately if he is convicted.

Vice President Mike Pence has said that it would be “altogether inappropriate and wrong” for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate. However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didn’t resign.

Menendez, who is up for reelection next year, was selected to replace former Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine in 2005.

If Menendez steps down from the Senate before Jan. 16, outgoing and widely unpopular Republican Gov. Chris Christie would get to appoint a successor. If Menendez steps down or is forced out after that date, the decision would go to newly elected Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

Carl Mayer, author of “Shakedown: The Fleecing of the Garden State,” has called for Menendez to resign.

“Menendez and Christie are opposite sides of the same coin: They both have excelled in the dark darts of New Jersey politics, but they are both, now, at the end of their political careers because voters are tired of the swamp,” he said.

Meanwhile Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April, in what The Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.

His parents fear that if the diagnosis is confirmed, they will not be able to afford the proper hormone treatments, causing their son's weight to continue to balloon with the potential to cause death. The genetic condition causes an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating and obesity. It can also cause intellectual impairment and learning disabilities, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

By Cleta Mitchell and Hans von Spakovsky, The Wall Street Journal



Donna Brazile has confirmed Bernie Sanders’s worst suspicions. Ms. Brazile, who served as interim chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the fall 2016 campaign, says in a new book that during the primaries, the DNC was controlled by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Ms. Brazile claims the arrangement was “not illegal,” but that is far from clear.

Ms. Brazile reports that when she arrived on the job in July 2016, Gary Gensler, the campaign’s chief financial officer, told her the DNC was fully under the control of the campaign. In September 2015, 10 months before Mrs. Clinton’s nomination, the party had moved its bank account to the same bank in New York used by the Clinton campaign and created a joint fundraising committee, the Hillary Victory Fund, whose treasurer, bank account, and control were vested in the campaign.

Then, in an August 2015 memorandum of understanding, the DNC essentially handed over its operations to the Clinton campaign for the next 15 months.

The purpose of joint fundraising committees is to allow more than one entity to collaborate in raising money and share in the costs. Each participant is subject to federal contribution limits. When the party itself is a participant, its committee (in this case the DNC) normally handles accounting and financial controls. Not here. The Hillary Victory Fund was controlled by the Clinton campaign, with a campaign employee as treasurer and the fund’s bank account established at the Clinton campaign’s bank. According to Federal Election Commission reports, the Hillary Victory Fund has raised more than $526 million.

The DNC asserted its “neutrality” by also entering into a joint fundraising committee with the Sanders campaign. It raised a total of $1,000. And the Bernie Victory Committee treasurer was the DNC’s designee.

“Money in the battleground states usually stayed in that state,” Ms. Brazile writes, “but all the other states funneled that money directly to the DNC, which quickly transferred the money to Brooklyn”—i.e., Clinton headquarters. She says state parties raised $82 million, of which they kept less than 0.5%.","Hillary Clinton, the DNC and the Law",http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/11/13/hillary-clinton-dnc-and-law#commenting

The judge sent the jury home for the day and told them to return on Tuesday to continue deliberations. The decision came after the judge had to speak with individual jurors about comments a dismissed juror made to the media over the weekend.

The New Jersey Democrat is accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence. Both Menendez and the doctor, Salomon Melgen, have maintained their innocence.

It’s the first time in nine years that a sitting U.S. senator is facing a federal bribery charge.

What is Menendez accused of?

Menendez, 63, accepted an abundance of campaign donations, gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist. In return, Menendez used his position to lobby on behalf of Melgen’s business interests, according to prosecutors.

Melgen allegedly directed more than $750,000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported Menendez, according to the indictment, which prosecutors said were inducements to get Menendez to use his influence on Melgen's behalf. Prosecutors have also accused Menendez of trying to hide the gifts.

Melgen paid for Menendez and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $1,500 per night and allowed the senator the use of his private jet, according to prosecutors.

NBC NEWS CALLS MENENDEZ A REPUBLICAN IN CORRUPTION CASE REPORT

Federal prosecutors said that Menendez “sold his office for a lifestyle that he couldn’t afford.”

The indictment also alleged that Menendez pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen's girlfriends.

What is the senator’s defense?

Both Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty – and Menendez has vehemently denied the accusations against him.

Throughout the trial, defense attorneys sought to prove that Menendez and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator, and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together.

At times emotional, Menendez has maintained his innocence throughout the trial.

What has happened in the trial so far?

Defense attorney Raymond Brown got into a spat with U.S. District Court Judge William H. Walls at the start of the trial. Brown accused Walls of being “extremely prejudicial to the defense.”

Walls had denied Menendez’s request that the trial be recessed during critical Senate votes, stating that his job should not be treated differently from that of a construction worker or cab driver.

MENENDEZ CASE MAY IMPACT VOTES

The trial has also focused on a meeting former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., set up with Menendez and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a nearly $9 million Medicaid billing dispute.

Sebelius testified in court that the incident was the first time in her role in government that she was asked by a senator to take a meeting with another senator. She said that Melgen wasn’t specifically mentioned in the meeting but that she assumed his case was the topic.

Prosecutors didn’t call Reid to testify before it rested its case on Oct. 11.

Walls declined to throw the case out despite the defense’s objections that the accusations against Menendez didn’t fit the narrow definition of bribery that was a result of a 2016 Supreme Court decision.

Menendez also had a little help from his friends.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., arrived at the Newark courthouse to testify as a “character witness” for the Democratic senator, Graham’s office confirmed. He testified about his experiences with Menendez in the Senate, “unrelated to the underlying charges,” his office said.

""In very difficult circumstances he always keeps his word,"" Graham, said during his testimony. ""A handshake is all you need from Bob. He's a very honest, hardworking senator.""

Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., has also appeared in support of Menendez.

Menendez was also emotional when he was asked by reporters about his colleagues’ support.

Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen?

Melgen, 63, was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U.S.

During that case, prosecutors argued that Melgen, who was born in the Dominican Republic, robbed Medicare of as much as $105 million, according to the newspaper. His sentencing has been delayed until after this trial.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE

Aside from Menendez, Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers, according to public records.

What happens if Menendez is convicted?

If Menendez is convicted and goes to prison, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., would pick a replacement.

That prospect is troublesome for Democrats who fear that Christie would pick a Republican to fill the Senate seat – giving the GOP an additional edge for legislative fights.

Vice President Mike Pence has said that it would be ""altogether inappropriate and wrong"" for a convicted felon to remain in the Senate. However, he said it would be a decision left up to the Senate if Menendez didn't resign.

Menendez is up for reelection next year. He was selected to replace former Gov. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., in the Senate in 2005.

The most serious charges against the two men carry a maximum 20-year prison sentence.

Needing a win at Phoenix to make the final four in next weekend's championship finale, Johnson saw his hopes crumple with a blown tire that sent his No. 48 Chevrolet into the wall with one lap remaining in the second stage Sunday.

The crash eliminated the reigning and seven-time NASCAR champion from title contention.

""I'm disappointed for sure,"" Johnson said. ""The last couple of months we've been staying alive and at this stage with the Round of 8 and then the Round of 4, you can't just stay alive. You've got to be hitting on all cylinders and we just haven't been there, unfortunately.""

It's been a rough ride for Johnson since matching Hall of Famers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with his seventh title a year ago.

Johnson won three races this year, but those came during the first third of the season. He hasn't won since Dover in June and has one top-five finish the last 21 races.

Johnson came to Phoenix last among the eight title contenders, 51 points out of mathematically qualifying. Martin Truex Jr, Kyle Busch and Kevin Harvick already locked into next weekend's championship finale next weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway, leaving Johnson among five drivers fighting for one spot.

A four-time winner at Phoenix, Johnson started 12th and earned a point by finishing eighth in the first stage. He was running 11th when his right front tired blew right before the caution at the end of the race's second stage.

Johnson drove the car straight to the garage, his day and championship hopes over.

""I didn't know it was coming,"" Johnson said. ""Clearly just got the brakes too hot and popped that tire with like a lap to go or two laps to go before the stage was up. We weren't leading, we were having a decent day, but we were going to need a great day today. I wish we were still out on track to still have a shot for it.""

“I don’t think there’s anybody in the Las Vegas valley that did not know someone who was affected.","A fighter jet at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada now is considered a work of art in tribute to the 58 victims who died in the Las Vegas shooting on Oct. 1. The aircraft is debuting to the public at Aviation Nation, an annual air show at the base.

The jet originally was going to be painted to honor the 70th anniversary of the Air Force, but when the tragedy happened, airmen decided to memorialize the event by treating a static, retired F-15 fighter jet as a canvas.

In just three short weeks, the plane’s paint job was complete, and it had to remain a secret among members of the base.

“The Air Force’s motto is adapt and overcome, and that’s what we did throughout the process. Everybody stepped up,” said Troy Blaschko, an aircraft painter.

He added, “We were very proud to be a part of this.”

The plane won’t be doing any flying, but will be on display for the duration of the air show, which is expected to draw over 400,000 people. It is one of the largest air shows in the western United States. Nellis Air Force Base is home to the Thunderbirds, the famous air demonstration squadron.

The base is integral to the wider Las Vegas community and was directly impacted by the shooting.

“We have some healing to do too. … The passion and the honor of the paint team and design crews as they put this airplane together piece by piece, and scrubbed it piece by piece with meticulous detail was all based on the honor of being able to give back something to the community,” said Major General Peter Gersten.

Around 20 people were involved in the project. Some of the motifs and images have a lot of detail. “Vegas Strong” is painted on the left fuselage, while also including the famous Las Vegas sign and the city’s skyline featured in other areas on the plane.

This wasn’t the only paint job Blaschko and his team undertook. On the opening day of the show, there was one surprise. The same painters also were tasked with a second job: painting Vegas’ new motto, “Vegas Strong” onto the tail of an F-16. This aircraft did fly for the spectators during the show, flying low enough so people on the ground could see it.

“I don’t think there’s anybody in the Las Vegas valley that did not know someone who was affected.

FOX's Eric Shawn spoke with Bassam Rifai, who is currently serving as a government relations board member for the Syrian American Council and is also the director of public affairs at SCM Medical, an NGO that provides medical and humanitarian aid to refugees.

Veterans Day, which falls on Saturday this year, is set aside to reflect on military service to our country. Every American should take a moment to appreciate and honor the service and sacrifice of all who have served in the U.S. military. We owe them more than we can repay.

Throughout American history, approximately 45 million Americans have served in our armed forces during times of war, along with additional millions who served in peacetime. Since 1775 close to 1.4 million members of the military have died in our wars and military actions.

In a statement sent out ahead of Monday’s news conference, Moore’s campaign stated that the allegations were part of a “witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character.”

The statement continued, “Let it be understood: the truth will come forward, we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated.”

Less than an hour after Nelson spoke, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, said he believed those who have spoken out against Moore, “proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office.” Gardner added that if Moore wins the election, “the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.”

Nelson alleged that Moore, under the premise of giving her a ride home from her shift at the Old Hickory House in Gadsden, parked his car behind the restaurant, and allegedly started to put “his hands on my breasts” when she was a teenager.

Nelson said she tried to escape from Moore’s car, but he locked the doors and allegedly put his hands on her neck and tried to force her head “on his crotch.”

Nelson said she tried to fight Moore off as he tried to remove her shirt. Becoming visibly emotional, Nelson said: “I thought he was going to rape me.”

Nelson added that before she got out of the car, Moore gave up his sexual advances, and told her, “You’re just a child. I am the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this — no one will ever believe you.”

She also said that Moore would frequent the restaurant -- and would twirl her waist-length hair when she walked past.

Nelson is the fifth woman to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct. The Washington Post reported Thursday that he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, which Moore said was “completely false.”

Nelson told reporters both she and her husband are strong supporters of President Donald Trump, and that this has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans, but rather her experiences with Moore from her teenage years.

The details in Albert Diaz’s indictment highlight the growing scams carried out by medical professionals and pharmacists to hock phony pain ointments that only function to bilk taxpayers of millions of dollars and, in some cases, leave patients dead.

In numerous ploys reminiscent of 19th century snake oil salesmen, pharmacy owners and marketers are bribing or giving kickbacks to doctors for writing spurious prescriptions to Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare patients for costly, dangerous and unneeded pain and scar creams. These compounded ointments – many of which have been found to contain a powerful anesthetic and sedative known as ketamine – have led to at least two deaths and can cost the government up to $28,000 per cream container.

“The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams,” wrote Carol Crisci, an attorney at Chartwell Law Offices. “If these creams worked, and actually reduced patient reliance on oral narcotics, the high price might be warranted. The problem is that there is little evidence that the creams or many of their expensive ingredients actually work when rubbed into the skin.”

Once the predominant form of pharmacy in the U.S. before the advent of mass drug manufacturing in the 1950s, compounding pharmacies mix medications and ingredients based on a doctor’s prescription for strength and dosage. While this allows pharmacists to specifically tailor a medication for patients who may have an allergy to certain ingredients or need a higher or lower dosage than produced, it can also lead to scams and abuse like the fraudulent pain creams.

After more than 50 people died from fungal meningitis and another 680 were sickened after receiving injections in 2012 of a contaminated steroid made by the New England Compounding Center, the Food and Drug Administration investigated and found 30 compounding pharmacies across 18 states with numerous unsafe practices.

In the case of the pain cream schemes, which have been unearthed from New Jersey to California, all follow a similar pattern, with doctors and compound pharmacies working hand-in-hand to prescribe patients these bogus ointments and reaping the financial benefits when the government paid the tab. Pharmacists also have been known to change the ingredients and exploit the narrow legitimate medical uses of the creams to keep ahead of the law.

""The snake oil for the 21st century is currently being peddled by compounding pharmacies with claims of miraculous pain creams."" - Carol Crisci, attorney at Chartwell Law Offices

In two active cases in Texas, pharmacies allegedly defrauded the government of more than $180 million. In one case, the Dallas Morning News reported that Fort Worth’s Ability Pharmacy spent $15 to make a container of cream and charged $28,000 to the government, with federal prosecutors claiming the pharmacy took in $1 million a day on these compound medications alone.

There was no difference in any of the creams given to different patients and many of the patients prescribed the ointments did not have any pain or scars to treat.

“This is yet another shocking example of how unmitigated greed can spawn a fraud so brazen that it almost takes your breath away,” John Parker, the U.S. attorney in Dallas, told the Dallas Morning News. “I would suggest that the costs of playing these games far outweigh whatever short-term gains are realized, no matter their size.”

More nefarious than the financial fraud behind the schemes is the sometimes deadly consequences of taking these creams and ointments.

A baby in California died in 2012 after accidently ingesting her mother’s compound cream, which was ultimately linked to a shady kickback scheme.

Two years later, Desiree Ford, a 22-year-old Houston woman, died only hours after applying a pain cream to her skin. The Harris County medical examiner ruled that her death was caused by the toxic effects of two drugs in the pain cream.

Ford’s father, Richard, is suing the pharmacy that supplied his daughter with the cream, while the doctor who prescribed it – without having talked to or examined her – surrendered his medical license.

On Saturday, the network released a statement on Twitter explaining that it has severed ties with Dillard after another round of comments against Jennings, who stars on her own series, “I Am Jazz,” which chronicles her life following her decision at a young age to transition from a male to a female.

“We want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in ‘Counting On’ for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick’s personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,” the statement reads. “TLC is proud to share the story of Jazz jennings and her family and will continue to do so.”

The decision from the network comes after Dillard spoke for a second time about Jennings, arguing that he doesn’t believe that one can change their gender identity and refused to use feminine pronouns when discussing Jennings.

“I pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It’s sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what’s on tv these days,” he wrote in response to another commenter who brought up his older comments about Jennings.

As previously reported, Dillard, who came to fame alongside his wife Jill Duggar on TLC, previously took issue with Jennings saying that gender is “ordained by God.”

“What an oxymoron… a 'reality' show which follows a non-reality. 'Transgender' is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it’s ordained by God.”

Jennings, who hasn’t directly responded to Dillard’s latest comments, said at the time:

“Every day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different.”

Dillard continued to respond to his latest statements, saying that he’s just trying to have a mature discussion about his concerns as a Christian. He also speculated as to the capability of a child to make decisions about their gender identity.

The highest-ranking Baltimore police officer who responded to the arrest of a black man who later died in custody didn't give a reason to investigators about why he didn't buckle the man into a seatbelt in the back of a van as required.

Detective Sgt. Thomas Curtis testified Monday at the start of administrative disciplinary proceedings in the case of Lt. Brian Rice, who is fighting for his job.

Curtis says when Rice was asked why he didn't put a seatbelt around Freddie Gray during an interview, he responded that ""he just didn't.""

But Michael Davey, Rice's lawyer, says the department failed to properly inform officers of a new mandate requiring seatbelts. That policy was only days old when Gray was arrested in April 2015. Davey also says shift commanders like Rice had discretion on whether to use a seatbelt.

Lt. Brian Rice was the highest-ranking Baltimore police officer who responded to the arrest of Freddie Gray in 2015. Rice's hearing began Monday before a police disciplinary board.

Neil Duke, a police department lawyer, said in opening statements that Rice failed to live up to his responsibility. Gray died from a spinal cord injury he suffered in a police van.

But Michael Davey, Rice's lawyer, says the police department failed to provide proper equipment and training to transport uncooperative or combative detainees in police vans.

Rice was acquitted of criminal charges last year in the case.

The highest-ranking officer involved in the arrest of a black man who was fatally injured in a police van is appearing before a police disciplinary board in Baltimore.

Lt. Brian Rice will appear Monday before a three-member administrative panel that is examining whether he broke any department rules for his role in arresting and transporting Freddie Gray, who died a week after his arrest from a spinal cord injury in April 2015, prompting riots in Baltimore.

The panel will decide whether to fire or otherwise discipline Rice.

Last week, an administrative board found Officer Caesar Goodson not guilty of 21 charges. Goodson was the van driver.

""[JetBlue customer service is] like, 'There's nothing we can do, we can cover your medical bills but that's about it,' said Langlois. She also claims the airline offered her a $50 voucher for a future JetBlue flight, though she doubts she’ll use it.

In the meantime, Langlois’ doctor has reportedly put her on antibiotics and pain medication, but she only has a few days left before her deadline for a series of rabies shots expires.

Gardeners know that a landscape is much more than plants. The lushest foliage and flowers have limited appeal without other elements to act as a foil. Rocks and stones play a vital role, setting unpolished grainy textures against delicate plants, playing earthy tones against vivid floral displays, and adding weight, mass and a sense of solidity to a dynamic green scene. Enlist these heavy hitters to take your garden to the next level of loveliness.

Steady as a rock. The presence of rocks in a garden is calming and restful. Surrounded by seasonal changes of plants and weather, rocks stand firm. For some, this steadfastness promotes a meditative environment and a strong connection with nature on a spiritual level.

Creating a rock garden as a place for reflection is possible in even the smallest garden, using existing materials and virtually no water. Sitting in a quiet corner contemplating plants growing in harmony with rocks is a respite from the busy outside world.

Stones for sustainability. Rocks, stones and gravel cut down on areas used for lawns and water-hungry plants, substantially reducing water usage. “With our limited water resources and changing climate, sustainability is an underlying philosophy for most landscape designers,” says Janine Mendel, a landscape designer at Cultivart Landscape Design.

Local heroes. Mendel points out that many washed river stones for sale are from countries like Indonesia, and this contributes to erosion there. Buying exotic stone is really the reverse of sustainability, she says. Going local makes even more sense when you factor in the financial and environmental cost of transporting heavy materials long distances.

Aesthetically, local stones and rocks add a cohesive look, especially if there are already naturally occurring rock elements in your garden.

Supporting players. Rocks and stones enhance feature plants as an attractive edging for garden beds. If existing soil is poor, they form a raised bed that can be filled with a more fertile medium.

When planting around rocks, consider color, shape and size. Dark green backgrounds make light rocks stand out, while pale planting makes an ideal foil for dark rocks. Don’t forget that rocks absorb heat — ideal for warmth-loving plants. Don’t plant shrubs that will grow to hide them.

Smooth stones are a lovely accent for tiny succulents in a small garden. Plant a selection of quirky cactuses in a light potting mix with crushed pumice or gravel mulch for drainage. Decorate with a layer of pretty stones — they’ll help retain moisture, which means that less watering is required.

Rocks au naturel. “The placement of rocks in a contrived landscape should reflect how they’d occur in a natural environment. It’s quite a creative skill,” Mendel says.

Japanese “dry landscapes.” Rocks and stones are fundamental to Asian gardens. The Japanese concept of karesansui, meaning “dry landscape,” has taken off globally as a way to use small spaces, reduce water consumption and provide a calm environment. Raked into ripples, sand or fine gravel represents ocean waves, while rocks symbolize islands. Moss is sometimes included, but no other plants or trees.

Water on the rocks. The alliance of rocks and water is key to Asian garden philosophy. It affirms the yin-yang concept of balancing opposite and complementary natural forces. Water is mercurial, filled with light and motion, while rocks are constant and immovable. Together, they create balance and unity.

Bring tranquillity and harmony to your garden by positioning rocks near water, whether it’s a small pond, a stone vessel or a bubbling water feature.

Water also intensifies subtle colors, sharpens contrast, and makes rocks and stones mirrorlike. Dull, dry rocks reveal their full beauty and character when wet, so submerge them or let droplets splash from a water feature to make them shine.

Sculptural rocks. When it comes to garden sculpture, nature does it best. Wind, water, earthquakes and time shape rocks into astonishing artworks. If you’re lucky enough to have an amazing rock, position it prominently to reveal its most interesting face.

Note: Landscaping outlets sell naturally sculpted rocks. Also keep an eye on construction sites — you may be able to get permission to haul away excavated rocks. Before removing any rock from private or public land like a beach or preserve, check to make sure that it’s allowed.

Bold boulders. A boulder is a large rock worn smooth by water. Transporting massive boulders for landscaping is expensive, but using lightweight ceramic versions is one solution.

Stacking stones. Humans have built piles of rocks and stones for eons; dry stone walls date back to Neolithic times. Rock walls have survived in many areas, including England, Ireland, Scandinavia and South America. The Peruvian Inca city of Machu Picchu is made entirely of dry stone construction.

“Currently in Australia one of the trends is … stone used in walling and paving rather than as a more sculptural element,” Mendel says. Local stones and no adhesive chemicals make dry stone walls an eco-friendly addition to a garden.

Cairns occur all over the world. In some places, they are primitive stone stacks; in others, elaborate hive-like monuments. They often have religious, memorial or ceremonial significance, though many were built as navigation aids for travelers.

Building a cairn is an absorbing way to spend time in nature. Play “rock Lego” and plant feathery grasses, such as the variegated Japanese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Variegata’) that wave in the wind as a contrast.

A cairn can be as simple as a tower of rocks in decreasing sizes. Ensure that your rocks have a stable seat, or use a little help from cement. Practice on small ones until you get the idea. When you feel confident, go bigger.

Choose a spot where it shows to best advantage and where surrounding plants enhance it.

A liking for lichen. Moss and lichen add color and texture to rocks, and they bring the impression of age. Their amazing colors often occur naturally and turn a nondescript rock into a special attraction.

I’ve used a “moss milkshake” with some success — and a good dash of patience. Make a thick sludge of buttermilk or yogurt and live moss (many nurseries sell tubs of moss, or you could collect it), and then paint it on rocks and stones in a shady place. Mist with water daily until it’s established. Pitted rocks are a better medium than smooth ones.

“Jones doesn’t fall in that category – he has a background as a prosecutor, he has linkage to Civil Rights prosecution for the bombers in Birmingham.","Before Roy Moore’s sexual assault allegations came to light, the Republican senate candidate was already a polarizing figure.

He’s argued that Muslims shouldn’t be able to serve in Congress; he promoted the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S.; he said in a 2005 interview that “homosexual conduct” should be illegal.

But even still, Steven Taylor, the political science chair at Alabama’s Troy University, thought voters in the deep red state of Alabama could look the other way.

“In some ways, that Roy Moore has a very strong religious element to his politics is not substantially out of the mainstream for the state,” Taylor told Fox News.

Then, slightly a month before the special election, the Washington Post released a bombshell report of allegations that Moore had inappropriate sexual conduct with teenage girls while he was in his 30s. One woman alleged that Moore had her touch him in private areas when she was just 14.

Moore has staunchly denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, but even still, many leading Republicans have called on him to step aside from the campaign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he believed Moore’s accusers in asking him to “step aside” from the race.

Whether Moore heeds the calls or faces further fallout from those in his party has yet to be seen. Read on for a look at the special Senate election to replace Jeff Sessions.

Roy Moore, Republican

Called the “Ayatollah of Alabama” by critics who believe he too closely marries his political and judicial responsibilities with religion, Judge Roy Moore emerged as the leader of the Republicans vying for the Senate seat. In a special primary election last month, Moore defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange who was tapped to fill the position when then-Sen. Jeff Sessions became the U.S. attorney general.

In the primary, Moore, 70, garnered the support of conservative darlings, such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson. President Donald Trump backed Strange, but his former advisor, Steve Bannon, campaigned for Moore.

Moore’s political past is mired in controversy, which he used to his advantage during the primary election. He was twice removed from Alabama’s Supreme Court. The first time, he was removed when he refused to move a boulder-sized Ten Commandments monument from the statehouse; he was permanently suspended in 2016 after he instructed probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples.

The Supreme Court debacles worked in his favor given that Alabamians are generally very conservative and religious, Taylor said. And his refusal to bend to the federal government is in line with a “tradition” set in the state by the former longtime pro-segregationist Gov. George Wallace, he said.

“He’s very outspoken in a variety of ways,” Taylor said of Moore. “He’s a little more reflective of those more populistic candidates we’ve seen of late, including the president.”

After Moore’s primary victory, Trump tweeted that he spoke to Moore “for the first time,” calling him a “really great guy who ran a fantastic race.” Many Trump supporters turned out to campaign for Moore during the primary, despite the president’s backing of a different candidate.

ALABAMA PASTOR DEFENDS EMBATTLED ROY MOORE

Moore’s past took a backseat, however, when the Washington Post reported that four women accused Moore of engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.

Leigh Corfman, now 58, alleged that Moore first approached her in a courtroom in 1979 when she was 14 years old. Eventually, Moore took her to his house, took off her shirt and pants, touched her private parts and guided her hand to his underwear, she said. The two did not have sexual intercourse, and he took her home when she asked, Corfman said.

Moore has vehemently denied the accusations, calling them “baseless” and “the very definition of fake news.”

“It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough. So let me be clear. I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,” Moore said in a statement provided to Fox News.

He also told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that he “generally” didn’t date women who were teenagers when he was in his 30s and would not date someone without their mother’s permission. And Moore admitted it’s possible that he did go on dates with one of the accusers in the Washington Post report who said she was 17 when Moore kissed her.

""He's very outspoken in a variety of ways.""

That line of defense is not “as strident or strong as one might expect,” Taylor said. “The question becomes: Does Mr. Moore come up with a more effective defense? Does he come up with a more coherent message to explain this story other than ‘fake news,’ although that does appeal to certain voters?”

Some polls immediately after the Washington Post’s report show an uptake in support for Moore’s Democratic counterpart, Doug Jones. But with Thanksgiving and big Alabama football games coming up, that could distract voters from the fallout of the allegations, Taylor said.

Doug Jones, Democrat

A former U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration, Jones beat out seven other Democrats to secure the party’s nomination.

Jones, 63, is perhaps best known for successfully prosecuting two members of the Ku Klux Klan accused of bombing a Birmingham church in 1963 that killed four young girls.

“I may have the honor of serving Alabama as your senator, but the most important thing I have done is prosecuting those klansmen who killed 4 little girls at 16th St Baptist Church,” Jones said in a tweet earlier this month.

Because of his resume, Taylor said he is considered to be a “quality candidate” in the political science world. He is “someone who is credible and therefore competitive,” Taylor said.

ROY MOORE SLAMS MCCONNELL, WASHINGTON POST AS CALLS TO LEAVE SENATE GROWS

“We’ve not seen a lot of quality Democratic candidates for Senate because Sen. [Richard] Shelby and Sen. Sessions, they were so strongly ensconced in their positions that the Democratic nominee was most often a more fringe candidate and not taken very seriously,” Taylor said. “Jones doesn’t fall in that category – he has a background as a prosecutor, he has linkage to Civil Rights prosecution for the bombers in Birmingham. This makes him a more serious and significant candidate.”

Openly critical of Trump, Jones has promised to fight for pro-abortion policies, tackling student loan debt and raising the minimum wage.

Even prior to the allegations of Moore groping a teenage girl, Democrats reportedly felt optimistic about Jones’ chances of winning in a historically red state. And after the allegations, some polls – such as the one produced by JMC Analytics – have Jones in the lead.

Jones has been endorsed by prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. His Twitter feed is riddled with photos of his campaign — from meeting with college students to discuss student loan debt to events with community leaders — but it doesn’t mention the allegations against Moore.

Alabama House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D, encouraged Jones to “stay the course” and not get bogged down with the allegations against Moore.

“Getting involved in the allegations, that doesn’t bring jobs to Alabama. That doesn’t bring opportunity or economic prosperity to our state. That doesn’t help education or health care. It doesn’t help our infrastructure,” Daniels told Fox News. “Why would he focus on that?”

Daniels also praised Jones for being “a fighter for his entire career.” He said Jones would bring “unity and civility” to the Senate and would work with lawmakers across the aisle to better Alabama.

Leona Evans, who was seriously injured, wound up in the water after driving her Hyundai Santa Fe across four lanes of traffic and through a fence on Friday.

""When we arrived, there was just this red SUV floating, wasn’t sitting, floating on the water in the middle of this retention pond,” Hillsborough County deputy Benjamin Thompson told FOX 13 Tampa.

Thompson and deputy Trent Migues arrived on the scene as several people who had witnessed the crash were trying to pull Evans' car out of the water.

""They had actually gotten a rope,” Thompson said. “They were trying to attach the car, thinking they could pull it back while it was floating.”

The station reported that Thompson dove into the pond and swam out to Evans. He then used his baton to smash the window of the SUV to get inside.

""I hit that window in the corner, and I hit it, and I hit it, and I hit it, and I hit it with all my life, then after about the 6th time it finally shattered,” he said. “And I knew the water was going to come in at that point, but I didn't realize how fast, it was like a waterfall, that car began to sink.""

Migues told reporters that ""the scariest moment was when her screaming stopped, and the roofline started going underneath the water, and my partner here disappeared in the car with her.""

Eventually, Thompson cut his face, arms and hands on jagged pieces of glass as he pulled Evans out of the vehicle.

They were then helped out of the water by Migues and the Good Samaritans.

""She was injured pretty bad, but she stuck out like a champ,"" Migues said. ""I told her she was a tough old lady. She enjoyed hearing that.""

In the case of Lara Trump, she was holding meetings in the White House trying to coordinate the training of service dogs that might otherwise be destroyed so the dogs could be given to veterans who need them, either for disabilities or other needs.

Lara Trump was working with The Humane Society and various veterans’ organizations. But because the groups met in the White House to talk about this project to help veterans, and because Lara Trump also serves on president’s campaign committee, the whole idea was deemed political patronage and attacked. This is absurd.

Had Lara been able to establish her program, how many veterans’ lives would be saved? How many veterans could have seen lives improve?

I understand we must guard against political patronage. No one should personally benefit financially from a family member in office. But this isn’t that.

What’s wrong with the president’s daughter-in-law – or his other relatives, for that matter –working as unpaid volunteers to benefit great causes like veterans and homeless animals? Isn’t this ideal of selfless service something that parents, religious leaders and teachers work to instill in all our children?

Lara Trump and other members of the Trump family deserve praise for their dedication to good causes. Yet incredibly, the leftist media mocks the Trumps and heinously twists their efforts on behalf of others to make it seem like they are some sort of crime family scheming to enrich themselves and harm our nation. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Media whining about this and other volunteer and charitable work by the Trump family has already forced some family members to give up this work.

For example, thanks to the media watchdogs, no longer is President Trump’s son (and Lara’s husband) Eric raising money to help children with cancer.

The anti-Trump media have also “saved” women from Ivanka Trump’s female empowerment fund. That's got to be a relief to feminists everywhere!

Now the liberal media finds nobility in precluding veterans from having a loving companion animal to accompany them? Thousands of dogs will instead be killed or used for research. The dogs can’t protest this injustice – but the rest of us should.

The leftist media wear the label ""hypocrite"" like a badge, and they only deepen the divide between the rational and irrational in America.

While they talk about unity and tolerance, members of the liberal media go out of their way to divide and mock. While they talk about liberalism, the only thing they do liberally is pass out hate for the Trump family, and their supporters (roughly half of voters). While they deem themselves ""progressive,"" the only thing progressive about them is that they are progressively ensuring a conservative landslide in 2018 and 2020.

President Trump may not need Lara Trump on the campaign side, or really need any of us (I serve on his Campaign Media Advisory Board, for full disclosure). He has the entire leftist regressive media campaigning non-stop for his re-election.

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.","At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded in Texas after a gunman dressed in tactical gear opened fire at a church outside San Antonio on Sunday, investigators confirmed.

Multiple sources speaking to Fox News identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. The mass shooting unfolded around 11:30 a.m. at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which is about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio.

Investigators said at a news conference Sunday evening that the victims ranged in age from 5 to 72 years old. One official said about 20 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from minor to ""very severe.""

Sunday's massacre is the deadliest church shooting in modern U.S. history. It is also, according to Gov. Greg Abbott, the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.

A possible motive was unclear. Kelley lived in a suburb of San Antonio and didn't appear to be linked to organized terrorist groups, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official said investigators were looking at social media posts Kelley may have made in the days before Sunday's attack, including one that appeared to show a semiautomatic weapon.

A spokesperson with the U.S. Air Force confirmed to Fox News that Kelley served in the military branch at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until a bad conduct discharge in 2014.

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and child, and when he was discharged received 12 months of confinement and a reduction in military rank.

""It is horrible,"" Wilson County Commissioner Larry Wiley told Fox News of the massacre. ""It appears someone walked in and started shooting.""

Around 11:20 a.m., Kelley arrived at a Valero gas station across from the First Baptist Church dressed in black tactical gear and a ballistic vest. He crossed the street and started firing a Ruger AR rifle at the church, officials said. He entered the building and kept shooting.

He was confronted by an armed nearby resident who chased after him. Kelley was later found dead, roughly five miles away in Guadalupe County, according to Wiley. It's unclear whether Kelley was killed by police or the armed resident, or from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

""We have accepted a multiple number of patients from the shooting,"" Megan Posey, a spokeswoman for Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, 15 miles from the church, told Fox News.

Some victims were transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, KSAT reported.

Officials said 23 people were found deceased in First Baptist Church, while two were found dead outside. One person who was transported to a hospital later died.

One of those killed was 14-year-old Annabelle Pomeroy, the church pastor's daughter.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, in addition to multiple other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The San Antonio Express-News reported police were checking the gunman's home for explosives following the shooting.

The church's layout would've made it difficult for churchgoers to flee a shooter who came through the front door, according to a congregant attending a vigil at the church Sunday night.

The church was described as having only small exits on the side and in the back, according to Hunter Green. He said if a gunman came through the front door, people ""wouldn't have had anywhere to go.""

Neighbors of Kelley's told The Associated Press they heard gunfire coming from his direction in recent days.

""It's really loud,"" 16-year-old Ryan Albers said. ""It was someone using automatic weapon fire.""

Another neighbor, who argued hearing gunfire in the area is not uncommon, said they had heard gunfire coming from across the street, but couldn't be sure if it was from Kelley's property.

Attorney General Paxton told Fox News that ""people never think"" a shooting like this can ""happen in their communities.""

""In a small town ... I can imagine that these people are devastated. And everyone in the community is going to ... have some type of close relationship"" to those either killed or injured at the First Baptist Church. He added it's ""hard to justify why anyone would do this.""

""This is horrific for our tiny little tight-knit town,"" Alena Berlanga, who lives 10 minutes outside of Sutherland Springs told The Associated Press. ""Everybody's going to be affected and everybody knows someone who's affected.""

President Trump, speaking from Tokyo during his trip to Asia, called the shooting an ""act of evil,"" and added: ""Through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong.""

Earlier, he tweeted: ""May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.""

Gov. Abbott said in a statement that ""While the details of this horrific act are still under investigation, Cecilia and I want to send our sincerest thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by this evil act.""

""I want to thank law enforcement for their response and ask that all Texans pray for the Sutherland Springs community during this time of mourning and loss,"" the statement read.

Sutherland Springs has a population of about 400 residents.

Sunday's shooting comes just over a month after 58 people were killed and hundreds injured on Oct. 1 after a gunman opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas.

The NFL take-a-knee protests dropped off dramatically Sunday, with all but a handful of players standing for the national anthem as teams pulled out the stops to honor the military for Veterans Day.

As of Sunday afternoon, only three players — the San Francisco 49ers’ Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin and the New York Giants’ Olivier Vernon — had refused to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” That was down from 15 players the week before, according to the ESPN tally.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff, who is leading House Democrats’ inquisition into Trump-Russia collusion, has not given up on proving that his party’s financed, Kremlin-sourced dossier is true.

The Californian pressed his case again this month during a long closed hearing with former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page to try to revive what had become dormant charges of criminal conduct.

Mr. Schiff, who on Wednesday labeled President Trump “the worst president in modern history,” previously said that one of his main objectives for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigation is to find which dossier parts are true.

In the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election last year, Mr. Schiff and his Democratic colleagues since January have been more than willing to cite the dossier’s paid unidentified Kremlin sources to attack the Trump administration.

FOX NEWS - If the Republicans were already under pressure to put points on the board, the Democratic wins on Tuesday have turned tax reform into the Super Bowl.

By their own admission, they need a major piece of legislation to take to the voters in 2018, whether the election results in Virginia and New Jersey are being overblown or not.

And yet they are struggling. Tax reform is a noble goal but an ugly process, with too much money at stake and too many vested interests fighting over each deduction. And President Trump's goal of getting this done by Christmas may prove exceedingly difficult.

By the way, his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, didn’t help matters by telling CNBC’s John Harwood, ""We see the whole trickle-down through the economy, and that's good for the economy."" He may be unaware that ""trickle-down economics"" is the pejorative label that Democrats slapped on Ronald Reagan’s approach to taxes.

The core of the political argument is whether or not the middle class is getting a tax cut, as the administration contends. The New York Times, in its own analysis, says no: ""Nearly half of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes in 2026 than they would under current rules if the proposed House tax bill became law, and about one-third would pay more in 2018.""

If the projects by the Times and other groups are right, it will be easier for critics to brand the effort as mainly helping the wealthy.

Melgar confronted the two Navy SEALs after discovering their alleged scheme, where they reportedly took money for themselves from a fund used to pay informants, the Daily Beast reported.

The two men tried to get Melgar to join the racket, but he declined the offer, the report said. Melgar later ended up dead in what appeared to be a strangulation.

Whether the SEALs were involved in the death remained unclear as the investigation continued. The commandos were initially described as “witnesses,” but authorities later changed that to “persons of interest.” Officials said Melgar’s cause of death was “homicide by asphyxiation.”

Melgar, 34, was found dead June 4 at the U.S. Embassy housing he shared in Mali with several other special operations personnel working in West Africa on training and counterterrorism missions, the New York Times reported.

There have been no charges so far in connection with the homicide, but two member of SEAL Team 6 – the famous counterterror unit that killed Usama Bin Laden in 2011 – were placed on administrative leave, pending investigation, according to the Times.

The SEALs reportedly told their military leaders that they found Melgar and tried to save him, according to the Daily Beast. They also said Melgar was intoxicated that night as he was taking hand-to-hand fighting exercises.

Reddit, a discussion website with various “subreddit” forums, has posted about the CICO diet across many of its weight-loss forums.

One user who had been following CICO for two months and shed 20 pounds wrote, “For years I actually thought that [losing weight] required vigorous exercise, and eating nothing but tilapia, broccoli, and spinach. How wrong I was,” Yahoo Style reported.

In a separate thread, another user shared, “CICO will work regardless of what you’re eating. Junk food, healthy food, fancy food, cheap food. It doesn’t matter. CICO is essentially the only thing that matters when it comes to weight loss.”

HOW LONG SHOULD IT REALLY TAKE TO LOSE WEIGHT?

However, the CICO diet, which stands for “calories in, calories out,” is challenged by nutritionists as an old way of thinking.

The diet suggests that you can eat whatever type of food you want – healthy food, junk food – and still lose weight by creating a calorie deficit throughout the day, meaning consuming fewer calories than you expend each day.

However, nutritionists argue that not all calories are created equally, and relying on calorie counting to lose weight does your body a disservice in the end. You have to also consider how your food choices affect your body beyond weight loss.

“Eating all junk, but keeping it low-calorie, will still wreak havoc on things like your skin, your mood, your gastrointestinal functions,” Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, and author of “The Superfood Swap” told Yahoo.

“At the core of it, it’s true that calories will rule things when it comes to weight loss,” Blatner concedes, but explains ""that is [only] true in the most crude, raw possible way.”

Nutrition expert, Cynthia Sass, MPH, RD and Health’s contributing nutrition editor told Yahoo, “We now know that the quality of the calories you consume—as well as the macronutrient balance and timing—all impact metabolism, satiety, and how your body utilizes calories.”

“It’s not as simple as a math equation,” Sass adds.

Clinical dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic, Mira Ilic, extrapolates on macronutrient needs stating a well-balanced diet is necessary for things like tissue repair, and muscle recovery and growth.

While Ilic knows people can lose weight with CICO, she says, “But would I recommend this to my patients? Definitely not.”

For those who are interested in being more calorie conscious, Blatner recommends looking at your plate and making sure you’re getting a balanced, healthy meal with whole grains, protein and vegetables.

“If you look at your plate and you have what you can guesstimate is a half-cup of a grain, that’s going to be roughly 150 calories; if you see a reasonably sized piece of protein, it’s likely about 3 ounces, or about 150 calories,” Blatner says. “And if you see a lot of vegetables, topped with just a little bit of fat, like a drizzle of olive oil, you’re probably adding up to about a 400 to 450 calorie meal.”

For the average woman looking to lose weight, Blatner suggests keeping 1,500 calories in mind as a daily goal.

“That number might be a little bit up or down, depending on whether you’re taller or shorter, or how much you exercise,” she explains, “but 1,500 calories is a great starting point.”",Most popular weight-loss diet on Reddit would never be recommended by nutritionists,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2017/11/12/most-popular-weight-loss-diet-on-reddit-would-never-be-recommended-by-nutritionists.html

Gunman David Patrick Kelley carried out the Nov. 5 attack at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.

Annabelle Pomeroy, 14, was one of the 26 victims who died.

""I know everyone who gave their life that day,"" her father, Pastor Frank Pomeroy, said Sunday, pausing to gather himself, ""some of whom where my best friends and my daughter.""

He wiped his eyes before adding, ""I guarantee they are dancing with Jesus today.""

Congregants wept during the service and a version of ""Amazing Grace,"" led by three singers and a man on guitar, as the voices of hundreds sang along.

The service was supposed to be held at a community center which could accomodate a few dozen people. It was moved to a tent in a baseball field when organizers realized hundreds planned to show up.

FIRST TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTING VICTIMS LAID TO REST

Later Sunday, a memorial opened inside the church. The interior is white from floor to ceiling, and the tribute includes 26 chairs, which include red crosses on the back and roses placed on the front.

The memorial also includes a wooden cross in the center front, as well as a Bible opened to Psalms chapters 149 and 150 and chapters 1-3 of the Book of Proverbs.

Pslam 100, which was going to be read when the shooting began but was never heard, is displayed on the front wall.

On Saturday, about 100 people gathered outside the community center to commemorate Veterans Day and honor the shooting victims, nearly half of whom had Air Force ties.

The league has faced pressure amid new outcry over the protests on social media, such as a Facebook page called “Boycott the NFL,”which boasted more than 227,000 followers and asked football fans to skip watching Sunday’s games “in solidarity with veterans around the country.""

The San Francisco 49ers' Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin were the only members of the team seen kneeling. No other protests immediately emerged. The controversy started last year with a one-man effort by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he wanted to draw attention to police mistreatment of African-Americans across the U.S.

The NFL players' union previously said its members planned to observe a moment of silence for veterans at Sunday’s games, while various teams planned other Veterans Day tributes, the Washington Times reported.

The Atlanta Falcons said each of their players would be wearing the initials of a fallen service member on a special helmet decal.

Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with teammates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting.

On Thursday night, all of the players with the Seattle Seahawks stood during the national anthem as part of the NFL's Salute to Service before playing the Arizona Cardinals, Q13 Fox reported.

As a massive American flag draped the field, guard Oday Aboushi, center Justin Britt, defensive linemen Dion Jordan, Frank Clark, Quinton Jefferson, Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, Jarran Reed, Branden Jackson, Nazair Jones, Sheldon Richardson and running back Thomas Rawls all stood, according to ESPN.

The protests broadened across the league in September, after President Trump told an Alabama crowd that any player protesting during the anthem should be removed from the field.

The president and other critics argued that the playing of the national anthem was the wrong time for protests, regardless of the reason, because the song represents U.S. national unity and respect for those who serve in the military.

North Korean soldiers shot at the unidentified North Korean soldier when he ran from the guard post at the northern side of the village, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.

He suffered gunshot wounds to his elbow and shoulder and was taken to the hospital when South Korean soldiers found him about 25 minutes later on the southern side of the Joint Security Area, a strip of land where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face, the military said, according to the South’s Yonhap News Agency.

""He crossed from a North Korea post towards our [South Korean] Freedom House,” the South said in a statement.

It’s unclear what the soldier’s conditions are or why he decided to defect to the South. The South Korean military said he was unarmed and was wearing a combat uniform for a law ranking soldier.

South Korean military said there was no armed conflict after the incident, but they are “increasing alertness” for a possible provocation from North Korea.

""Currently, there are no unusual signs in the North Korean military, but we are increasing alertness against the possibility of North Korean provocations,"" officials told Yonhap News Agency.

About 30,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the end of the Korean War, but most travel through China. An estimated 1,000 people flee Kim Jong Un’s volatile regime each year, but going through the DMZ — fortified with land mines, barbed wires and machine guns — have been extremely rare because of the dangerous conditions. This year, North Korean defectors successfully escaping the regime fell by 12.7 percent, according to the Telegraph.

The soldier’s successful escape makes only the fourth defection by a North Korean soldier through the DMZ in the last three years, the BBC reported. Yonhap News agency said Kim’s military officials reportedly “cherry-pick” loyal soldiers who are stationed at the DMZ.

At Panmunjom, once an obscure farming village inside the 2 1/2-mile-wide DMZ that separating the rivaling countries, North Korean soldiers wearing lapel pins with the images of late North Korean leaders often use binoculars to monitor visitors from the South. They stand only several yards away from tall South Korean soldiers wearing aviator sunglasses and standing motionless like statues.

Panmunjomis where an armistice was signed to pause the Korean War. Jointly controlled by the American-led U.N. Command and North Korea, the DMZ is guarded on both sides by hundreds of thousands of combat-ready troops, razor-wire fences and tank traps. More than a million mines are believed to be buried inside the zone.

The defection came during escalated tensions between the North and the South and nearly a week after President Trump visited Seoul for his five-country Asia tour. American presidents often visit Panmunjom and other DMZ areas during their trips to South Korea to reaffirm their security commitment to the South. Trump planned to visit the DMZ to underscore his stance against North Korea's nuclear program when he came to South Korea last week as part of an Asian tour, but his plans were thwarted by heavy fog that prevented his helicopter from landing at the border area.

Areas around Panmunjom were the site of bloodshed and defection attempts by North Koreans in the past, but there have been no such incidents in recent years.

The most famous incident was in 1976, when two American army officers were killed by ax-wielding North Korean soldiers. The attack prompted Washington to fly nuclear-capable B-52 bombers toward the DMZ in an attempt to intimidate North Korea.

In 1984, North Korean and U.N. Command soldiers traded gunfire after a Soviet citizen defected by sprinting to the South Korean sector of the truce village. The incident left three North Korean soldiers and one South Korean soldier dead. In 1998, a North Korean solider fled to South Korea via Panmunjom.

In a statement sent out ahead of Monday’s news conference, Moore’s campaign stated that the allegations were part of a “witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character.”

The statement continued, “Let it be understood: the truth will come forward, we will pursue all legal options against these false claims and Judge Moore will be vindicated.”

Less than an hour after Nelson spoke, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Cory Gardner, said he believed those who have spoken out against Moore, “proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office.” Gardner added that if Moore wins the election, “the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.”

Nelson said she tried to escape from Moore’s car, but he locked the doors and allegedly put his hands on her neck and tried to force her head “on his crotch.”

Earhart, who was attempting to fly around the world, disappeared on July 2, 1937 during a flight from Papua New Guinea to Howland Island in the Pacific. Researchers have claimed that new evidence from U.S. government archives may finally solve the mystery of what happened to the record-breaking pilot.

However, a Japanese blogger claims that the photo was actually first published in a travelogue in 1935, well before Earhart’s disappearance. “So the photograph was taken at least two years before Amelia Earhart disappeared in 1937 and a person on the photo was not her,” explains the blogger. The photograph, the blogger says, was first published in the Pacific island of Palau in a photo book called “Motoaki Nishin.""

DOES NEWLY DISCOVERED PHOTO REVEAL THAT AMELIA EARHART SURVIVED CRASH TO BECOME JAPANESE PRISONER?

The blogger, who tweets as @baron_yamaneko, was identified as Kota Yamano by the Guardian. Yamano unearthed the photo from the archives of Japan’s National Diet Library, the Guardian reports.

The photograph, which purportedly shows Earhart, her navigator Fred Noonan and their ill-fated plane after the crash, was presented as a critical piece of evidence in a History channel documentary that aired July 9. The photo shows a group of people on a dock and is captioned “PL-MARSHALL ISLANDS, JALUIT ATOLL, JALUIT ISLAND. JALUIT HARBOR. ONI #14381.”

The image, which has generated widespread attention, was said to show Earhart with her back to the camera.

AMELIA EARHART'S PLANE DISCOVERED ... IN OLD MOVIE

Some investigators involved in the documentary used the photo to support the theory that Earhart survived her final flight after crash-landing in the Marshall Islands. The aviator, they argue, was then captured by the Japanese military and died in their custody on the island of Saipan.

The History Channel said that it is looking into Yamano’s claims. “HISTORY has a team of investigators exploring the latest developments about Amelia Earhart and we will be transparent in our findings,” it said in a statement sent to Fox News. “Ultimately, historical accuracy is most important to us and our viewers.”

The documentary also focused on plane parts found on Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands that are said to be consistent with the aircraft Earhart was flying in 1937.

AMELIA EARHART MYSTERY CONTINUES WITH CLAIMS OF HER GRAVE

The first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, Earhart was one of the most famous people at the time of her disappearance. A number of theories have emerged about her fate.

One well-publicized theory is that Earhart died a castaway after landing her plane on the remote island of Nikumaroro, a coral atoll some 1,200 miles from the Marshall Islands. Some 13 human bones were found on Nikumaroro, which is also known as Gardner Island, three years after Earhart’s disappearance. The bones, however, were subsequently lost.

Four bone-sniffing dogs were recently brought to Nikumaroro as part of an expedition sponsored by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) and the National Geographic Society. National Geographic reported July 7 that the dogs have located the spot where Earhart may have died. No bones, however, were found although plans have been made to send soil samples from the spot for DNA analysis in Germany.

Restoring the rule of law therefore requires enforcing our immigration laws.
We are rewarding those jurisdictions that assist federal law enforcement—not those who refuse to, like “sanctuary” jurisdictions.
When necessary, we go to court to keep the American people safe, such as when we defend the president’s right to protect this country from security threats.
We are defending the president’s clear legal right to stop the entry of those who cannot be adequately vetted.","The rule of law is the foundation of our system of government. In the vision of our Founders, we have “a government of laws—and not of men.”

Under President Trump’s strong leadership, the Department of Justice has made restoring the rule of law our top priority. Everything we do is guided by this principle.

Under the previous administration, parties who had been sued by the government and then settled the lawsuit were sometimes required to pay community organizations that were not even involved in the case or harmed by the defendant. That was not only wrong, but contrary to longstanding legal principles, and we have put a stop to it. Lawsuit settlements with the government should not be used to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the friends of whomever is in power. They should help compensate victims or go to the taxpayer. Now that is what they will do.

We are also trusting our prosecutors again and letting them do their jobs. The previous administration forced them to leave out important facts in drug cases to achieve sentences lighter than were required by the law. Federal drug prosecutions—and sentences—went down dramatically. Meanwhile drug deaths rose to unprecedented levels.

We have removed this restriction on our prosecutors and told them to target the most violent criminals. They have already achieved significant results, with charges for federal gun crimes up nearly a quarter.

Under this administration, the Department of Justice is serving the American people by following the laws they have duly enacted—and we are just getting started.

The rule of law means abiding by all of our laws. Restoring the rule of law therefore requires enforcing our immigration laws.

We are rewarding those jurisdictions that assist federal law enforcement—not those who refuse to, like “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Our law enforcement grants now have conditions to encourage our state and local partners to help us remove criminal aliens from this country. Politicians have no right to protect criminals or promote lawlessness.

Neither do those entrusted with classified information. Leaks break the public trust and threaten public safety. That is why we tripled the number of active investigations into leaks. We have already charged four people with unlawfully disclosing classified material or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers.

When necessary, we go to court to keep the American people safe, such as when we defend the president’s right to protect this country from security threats. We are defending the president’s clear legal right to stop the entry of those who cannot be adequately vetted. Numerous judges—and two district courts—have upheld the president’s travel ban, and we are confident that it will stand.

The Department cannot, however, defend illegal actions. That is why we advised the administration to end the previous administration’s unlawful Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA. This policy was contrary to our immigration laws and did not have Congressional approval—indeed, Congress rejected similar legislative proposals numerous times.

For the same reason, the Department has agreed to settlement terms with 469 Tea Party and other conservative groups whose tax-exempt applications were delayed by the IRS based on inappropriate criteria including conservative names and policy positions, and civil cases with 90 plaintiffs regarding the previous administration’s contraception mandate. These cases never should have been necessary.

Religious liberty is an inalienable right, and at the president’s direction, we issued legal guidance on how to properly interpret and apply legal protections for religious liberty. And it is not just freedom of worship: we do not give up our religious freedom when we are at work, when we interact with the federal government, or any other time we participate in society.

We do not give up our rights when we go to school, either. This Department is standing up for those whose rights have been violated on campus, including supporting a lawsuit by one young man who was punished for discussing his faith outside of his school’s tiny “free speech zone.” And we are examining a case where Asian-American students allege racial discrimination in one university’s admissions.

On Monday’s episode of Maron’s famed “WTF” podcast, he addressed the bombshell New York Times report in which women came forward to say C.K. masturbated in front of them. The 50-year-old comedian released a statement to the media apologizing for his actions and confessed the allegations are true.

Maron, who has been friends with C.K. for years and even appeared on his FX series “Louie,” opened his show by addressing his friend admission saying that ""he did some vile, inappropriate, hurtful, damaging selfish” stuff.

The “Maron” star noted that he’d heard about the allegations and even asked C.K. directly about the rumors. However, he says that the star lied to him, prompting him to side with his friend on the matter -- until now.

“Sadly, I knew what most people knew: There was a story out there, I guess going back several years, there were unnamed people in the story, it took place in a hotel room in Aspen. It was always out there, but then it would pick up momentum at different times,” Maron said. “And I would ask him about it. I would say, ‘This story about you forcing these women to watch you jerk off, what is that, is that true?’ He goes, ‘No, it’s not true. It’s not real. It’s a rumor.’ And I would say, ‘Well, are you going to address it somehow? Handle it? Get out from under it whenever it shows up?’ ‘No I can’t, I can’t do that. I can’t give it life, give it air.’ That was the conversation.”

Maron said the climate in the world of comedy needs to change so women feel comfortable speaking out.

“The real problem is that female comics have been hearing about this stuff or a while, and there was no place where they could go with that information,” he said. “So, when it comes to believing women, I want to believe women, but in this particular instance, there was no one named in that story. There was no place for women to go tell this story. There were no women attached to it. I didn’t know their names until Friday… So I believed my friend.”

Since the allegations against C.K. and his admission to misconduct, FX has cut all ties with the comic and Netflix has decided not to produce another planned stand up special from the comedian. Additionally, his new movie “I Love You, Daddy” has been dropped by its distributor, The Orchard, which announced on Friday it would no longer be releasing the movie.",Louis C.K.'s friend Marc Maron says comedian lied to him about sexual misconduct rumors,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/13/louis-c-k-s-friend-marc-maron-says-comedian-lied-to-him-about-sexual-misconduct-rumors.html

Many of us have piles upon boxes upon albums of photos that we haven’t picked up in years. This month marks the season of gratitude - the perfect time to take a trip down memory lane. Here are eight ways to finally organize, use and declutter your family photos.

Research. If you’re a history buff or just curious about the strangers staring back at you with striking resemblance, there are a few measures you can take to piece together your family tree. If you know where the photos were taken, dedicate a rainy afternoon to pouring over information at the local library. Some newspapers will print photos with a caption asking readers if they recognize people in the picture. You can also hire a genealogist or upload photos online to genealogy sites if you’re willing to pay for research.

Donate. Most of us find it difficult to throw photos away, let alone ones that have been passed down from generation to generation. If you can’t find any connection to your collection, most historical societies accept photos, especially if you can provide some information about how you inherited them.

Reminisce. Pass around family photos and albums at your next family gathering. Stoke the fire and let the storytelling begin! This is a great chance to learn more about your family and introduce your kids to their late relatives who they never met, but can still get to know through cherished photo albums.

Digitize. Printed photos are typically stored in attics, basements and closets and are therefore susceptible to fires, floods and dust. Preserve photos by scanning them yourself, shipping them to a scanning service or hiring someone to scan them for you. Saving photos to the cloud will give them a safe home where they’ll stay vibrant forever.

Display. Gallery walls are very popular in today’s home designs. Use frames all in the same color for a consistent, contemporary look or arrange frames in different shapes and sizes around other wall decor for an eclectic vibe. Hang photos on a wall with track lighting to put your photos in the spotlight.

Scrapbook. Scrapbooks make meaningful holiday gifts full of creativity and personalization. Get the whole family involved by giving each child an age-appropriate task, like taping or labeling, or assign them few pages to complete on their own. If you’re making these books for your own home, make sure you keep them in an accessible place rather than storage so you can enjoy them more often.

DIY. Go to any craft store and you’ll find that there are so many more creative ways to use and display photos beyond frames and scrapbooks. Buy a big jar of Mod Podge and create playful collages or make ornaments for the Christmas tree. You could also arrange photos under glass on a dresser or desktop to enjoy them in every room.

Delete. After you’ve backed up your collection with digital copies, you can feel better about throwing away printed photos that you didn’t display or use. It’s also important to declutter your digital collection so that it’s easier to find and share photos online. You can safely delete the following from your devices: duplicates; blurry or dark shots; unphotogenic moments you know you will never share or display; and shutter mistakes, like accidental shots of the ceiling or the contents of your purse.",What to do with all of your family photos,https://www.foxnews.com/real-estate/2017/11/10/what-to-do-with-all-your-family-photos.html

The appellate judges adopted language that the Supreme Court itself either wrote or blessed when it considered legal challenges to the previous version of the travel ban.
In June, the justices said the travel ban could not keep out of the country people who could claim a bona fide relationship with someone or a group in the U.S.
The decision ""closely tracks guidance previously issued by the Supreme Court,"" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in a statement.","A U.S. appeals court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump's newest version of the travel ban to partially take effect.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling will bar people from six Muslim-majority countries included in the travel ban who do not have a ""bona fide"" relationship with a person or entity in the U.S. from entering the country. The ban can't be enforced against people who have those relationships.

Hawaii sued to stop the latest ban, which was announced in September. Hours before it was set to take full effect last month, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii issued a ruling blocking the ban. Watson found that the new ban, like the version before it, failed to show that nationality alone makes a person a greater security risk to the U.S.

The policy applied to travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen plus some Venezuelan government officials and their families.

Rulings against the ban in Hawaii and later in Maryland apply only to the six Muslim-majority countries. They did not affect the restrictions against North Korea or Venezuela, because the plaintiffs did not ask for that. The Maryland ruling was narrower than the Hawaii one in that it allowed enforcement against those with no U.S. ties.

The U.S. government appealed, saying the rulings thwarted Trump's efforts to keep the American people safe.

The 9th Circuit in San Francisco had blocked previous versions of the ban.

""We are reviewing the court's order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay,"" U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said in a statement. ""We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety.""

The appellate judges adopted language that the Supreme Court itself either wrote or blessed when it considered legal challenges to the previous version of the travel ban.

In June, the justices said the travel ban could not keep out of the country people who could claim a bona fide relationship with someone or a group in the U.S.

The justices did not list precisely what kinds of relationships were covered, but they left in place a subsequent 9th circuit ruling that protected grandparents, cousins and other relatives.

Monday's ruling spells out the ""close family relationship"" includes grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.

The decision ""closely tracks guidance previously issued by the Supreme Court,"" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in a statement. ""I'm pleased that family ties to the U. S., including grandparents, will be respected. We continue to prepare for substantive arguments before the Ninth Circuit on December 6 in Seattle.""

Study author Kerry Emanuel, a meteorology professor and hurricane expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that what was once an extremely rare event — 20 inches of rain over a large area of Texas — could soon be almost common.

From 1981 to 2000, the probability of 20 inches of rain happening somewhere over a large chunk of Texas was 1 in 100 or even less, Emanuel said. Now it's 6 in 100 and by 2081, those odds will be 18 in 100, he said.

""The changes in probabilities are because of global warming,"" Emanuel said.

The study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Emanuel said he hurried the study to help Houston officials think about what conditions they should consider when they rebuild.

Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said he was struck by the potential for much higher rainfall that Emanuel's simulations predict for the future and how important it is for the design of critical structures like dams and nuclear facilities.

""If the worst-case precipitation scenario is getting worse, as Kerry's study and other evidence implies, that safety margin is shrinking,"" Nielsen-Gammon said in an email, highlighting Emanuel's results that also show the worst-case storms becoming wetter and more common.

Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at Princeton who wasn't part of the study, said the study confirms what scientists have already thought: ""that the most extreme rainfall events will become more likely as the planet warms.""

""These results highlight the importance of finding ways to incorporate our understanding of climate change in long-term urban planning, storm water management and in flood mapping,"" Vecchi said in an email.

To do the study Emanuel had to use some innovative modeling techniques. Global climate models used for future warming studies aren't detailed enough to simulate hurricanes. Hurricane models don't say anything about the larger climate. So Emanuel combined the models and then created thousands and thousands of fictional storm ""seedlings"" to see what would happen.

Emanuel's calculations used the 20-inch (half a meter) rainfall total because that was the initial figure discussed as the storm was dying down.

Later measurements showed that Harvey's rain was far heavier — and far rarer — than initially reported. After Emanuel had started his work, records showed Harvey's Houston-wide rainfall ended up closer to 33 inches (84 centimeters). And in individual areas pit peaked at 60 inches (1.5 meters).

Emanuel called those numbers ""biblical.""

""By the standards of the average climate during 1981-2000, Harvey's rainfall in Houston was 'biblical' in the sense that it likely occurred around once since the Old Testament was written,"" Emanuel's study said.

It’s easy to overlook a mirror. After all, when we look at one, we see a reflection of so many other things before we even see the mirror itself. But a good mirror is an essential component to many rooms, especially your bathroom. There are many options for size, style and shape to choose from, so I’ve put together this guide to help you put things into perspective and get your bathroom mirror just right.

Sizing Your Mirror

When choosing the size of your mirror, you should consider not just function, but also proportion. To create a balanced look, think about the size of your mirror relative to that of your vanity.

Typically, vanity mirrors are not wider than the vanity itself, with some exceptions we will discuss a little later.

A common approach is to make the mirror exactly as wide as the vanity so the two line up perfectly.

Of course, this is much easier with a custom-sized mirror because you may not happen to find a pre-made mirror in the exact width of your vanity.

If they are not the same width, another solid approach is to make the mirror about 70 to 80 percent as wide as the vanity so the mirror appears a bit smaller, but not shrunken.

With respect to height, a functional mirror needs only to reach about a foot above and below the eye line of the people who will be using it. But the more height you can get, the better, because it will provide more viewing angles and a more open look to the space. Try to reach at least 4 to 7 feet above the floor.

Single vs. Multiple

If you have a wide vanity, especially one with multiple sinks, you have the option of using multiple mirrors or one single mirror wide enough to service both.

Using several tall and skinny mirrors can give a room a more vertical look, emphasizing the height of the space (especially effective when you have high ceilings). Of course, using a single large mirror opens up the room by reflecting more of the opposite walls. Ultimately the choice comes down to personal preference.

Using multiple mirrors can still work even when there is only one sink.

In fact, centering a mirror on the sink and then adding a second mirror symmetrical to the first can make the whole composition look more pleasingly balanced, compared with using just a single mirror.

Sconces

Another reason to use smaller mirrors is, of course, to allow some room for sconces to sit in between. Vanity light can be located in various places, but placing it to the sides of the mirror lights the face well, so it is both beautiful and functional.

When leaving room for sconces, choose a mirror that is closer to 60 to 70 percent of the width of the vanity (divided by the number of mirrors if you have more than one), so the sconces have room to sit above the vanity rather than hanging beyond the edges.

Wall-to-Wall Mirrors

For a different approach to sizing your mirror, you can ignore the size of the vanity on its own and instead use the mirror to fill the whole wall, often running above the toilet as well. This approach gives you a larger mirror, which can go a long way toward making a compact bathroom feel twice the size.

In this case, you can run the mirror literally wall-to-wall (and typically up to the ceiling) or extend it from one end of the vanity to the end of a nearby fixture.

In the latter case, though, it should still fill most of the wall to avoid looking like it’s simply the wrong size. And it should line up neatly with the objects below.

On one hand, having a custom-sized mirror cut to fit perfectly wall-to-wall is a higher investment than purchasing a prefab piece.

On the other hand, compared with running tile or stone behind or around a smaller mirror, it is often a relatively budget-friendly choice.

Depending on your budget and goals, it may make a lot of sense to use a custom-fitted mirror paired with a little splash of a splurge material below.

Framed vs. Frameless

Frameless mirrors are a popular choice in bathrooms for a few likely reasons. One is that they tend to be less expensive while often still quite stylish. A second is that they give modern appeal, and bathrooms even in somewhat traditional homes often run a bit more modern to achieve a clean, airy, “spa-like” look.

Frameless mirrors work most easily in contemporary or modern and minimalist spaces without a lot of busy decor. Mirrors with elaborate frames tend to suit traditional spaces where the other elements are also very detailed and decorative.

For a nice balance that can suit nearly any space, try a mirror with a simple frame that is a few inches wide and in a textural material that isn’t too busy.

For an eclectic sensibility, an ornate mirror can look magnificent as a statement piece in a modern bathroom.

Getting the mix just right will take a good design eye, but the unique result will bring a lot of personality and drama to the room.

Inset Mirrors

A clever way to get the modern look of a frameless mirror and the sense of polish of a framed mirror is to inset the mirror into tile so it’s essentially framed by the surrounding material.

Layering floating shelves over the top gives extra additional modern flair and some useful storage.

Round Mirrors

We’ve mostly looked at simple rectangular mirrors so far, but of course there are many other shapes.

Round mirrors can be a great way to bring some softness and relaxed appeal to a bathroom, which often has a lot of hard surfaces and crisp lines.

Round mirrors are a great companion to pedestal sinks, as they often have curved lines themselves.

Round mirrors generally leave more negative space at the “corners” than a rectangular mirror would, which makes sense because pedestal sinks leave some negative space around the pedestal base.

A round mirror is also a great choice if you have an interesting wall finish to show off. It gives you enough mirror to see your face, but it leaves a bit more wall exposed, and the curved lines will pick up the organic shapes in a leafy or floral print.

Medicine Cabinets

Sure, all of the previous mirrors were attractive, but what if you need some serious storage space?

Medicine cabinet mirrors are best when inset into the wall — that way they won’t be so in-your-face. A professional can guide you during a site visit as to whether your wall cavity can house some inset or partially inset cabinets.

Otherwise, try using a few tricks to avoid letting that cabinet visually shrink the room.

A cabinet with little or no frame will avoid feeling in-your-face, while adding some under-cabinet lighting (just as you might in a kitchen) will bring a glow that cancels out any dark shadows and makes the whole sink area feel more open.

Suspended Mirrors

If you have an unusual bathroom layout or an inconveniently placed window or obstacle, don’t forget that mirrors don’t absolutely have to hang flat on a wall.

Suspending a mirror from the ceiling or a window frame, or mounting it on rails rising from the counter, can allow you to place a mirror in a new, functional spot.

“House of Cards,” goodbye and good riddance!","The next Kevin Spacey-less season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" will be the last. To those lamenting its end, I say good riddance.

I for one will not miss what I have come to view as one of the most anti-American phenomena in modern pop culture. With an upside-down American flag as its logo, and “Democracy Is So Overrated” as both its Facebook and Twitter themes — with 3 million likes and 2 million Twitter followers— our enemies couldn’t have designed a better way to undermine our democracy through entertainment and social media. There’s a reason that “House of Cards” is so popular in China and Russia: it paints a dark, dystopian picture of America. Is that what we really need right now?

I realize that I’m unusual. It seems everybody in Washington, D.C., watches “House of Cards.” But many in Washington came here from elsewhere, don’t stay long, and are proud of being “outsiders” in a town full of transients. I was born and raised here, and have been a lifelong resident of Our Nation’s Capital. My husband and I got married here, live and work here, raised our kids here. We don’t blackmail others, manipulate reporters, have an open marriage, make pacts to destroy colleagues’ careers, profanely insult underlings in business meetings, murder political rivals, create phony cyberattacks by foreign entities, or orchestrate fake terrorist attacks in order to stage coup d’etats. And no one else we know in Washington does, either.

“When Sergey Shoygu became Russia’s minister of defense in 2012, Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave him some interesting advice: If you want to understand America, he said, watch “House of Cards.”

The problem with “House of Cards” is it paints everyone in Washington with the same poison brush. I suspected it would bad for our brand from the start, but tuned in for the first season out of curiosity. I turned off the first episode after Frank Underwood killed a dog with his bare hands. After a year of persuading, friends talked me out of my boycott. I gritted my teeth through three more episodes, until Frank Underwood was in bed with a 20-something female reporter 30 years his junior, who was calling her dad to wish him a happy Father’s Day while the Congressman was ripping her clothes off. We have two twenty-something daughters. I was done.

Here’s how the creators themselves describe “House of Cards:” “This wicked political drama slithers beneath the curtain and through the back halls of greed, sex, love and corruption in modern Washington D.C.”

No wonder Chinese censors allowed “House of Cards” to continue its run for years — it depicts America as corrupt, sleazy, and weak. According to the New York Post, “When Sergey Shoygu became Russia’s minister of defense in 2012, Russian leader Vladimir Putin gave him some interesting advice: If you want to understand America, he said, watch “House of Cards.” In his book “All the Kremlin’s Men,” author Mikhail Zygar writes that “House of Cards” affirmed Putin’s belief “that Western politicians are all cynical scoundrels whose words about values and human rights are pure hot air and simply a tool to attack enemies.”

So much for being the beacon of democracy and freedom in the world. So much for winning the moral high ground over the twisted ideology of ISIS. Much better for Hollywood to have a wildly popular show that is “critically acclaimed” — seven Emmys and a whopping 53 Emmy nominations so far, but that’s another column for another day — and at the same time glorifies a president whose initials are “F.U.” Again, bad for the brand.

So much for being the beacon of democracy and freedom in the world. Much better for Hollywood to have a wildly popular show that is “critically acclaimed” and at the same time glorifies a president whose initials are “F.U.”

By its own account, Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 70 million members in over 190 countries watching more than 125 million hours of content a day. Maybe promoting a show that delights in bashing American democracy and trashing public service in front of that big a global audience is one reason why elected officials consistently rank below used car salesmen in public trust. It may be only one of many reasons, but “House of Cards” certainly isn’t helping to encourage good people to go into public service.

I worked for President George H.W. Bush, who said – in a quote that is engraved below his bust at the George H.W. Bush School of Public Service at Texas A&M University – “Public service is a noble calling and we need men and women of character to believe that they can make a difference in their communities, in their states and in their country.”

That’s why I went into public service, and I know a lot of other people – from both sides of the aisle – who did the same. Now that Frank Underwood is gone, maybe we’ll see more men and women of character believing they can make a difference, too. We need them.

It wasn’t long before football players across the fruited plain, from pee-wee to professional, emulated Mr. Kaepernick’s unpatriotic protest. Even a few cheerleaders dropped their pom-poms in a show of solidarity.

They said they were protesting alleged racial inequality and police brutality, but it’s pretty clear to most of the country that Mr. Kaepernick and his minions were dishonoring the flag, the anthem and the military.

GQ, the magazine for emasculated men, hailed Mr. Kaepernick as a “powerful symbol of activism and resistance.”

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness. That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

The designation came in the magazine’s annual “Men of the Year” edition – subtitled, “The New American Heroes.”

Apparently, GQ seems to think that disrespecting our military and spitting on our flag is a symbol of heroism and manliness.

That’s not citizenship – that’s cowardice.

“In my view, the most pernicious element of white backlash against Colin’s protest has been the way in which the narrative has been co-opted and re-framed so that taking a knee is now somehow synonymous with disrespecting the flag, with a lack of patriotism,” scholar Christopher Petrella wrote in a GQ essay.

Activist Linda Sarsour, co-founder of the “Nasty Woman” march heralded the failed professional football player as a genuine American hero.

“There might even be a day when we’ll be walking down Colin Kaepernick Boulevard and people will remember what Colin Kaepernick did, just like we remember Muhammad Ali,” she wrote in a GQ essay. “And I truly believe that in my heart.”

It's quite telling when you consider who did not make the GQ “Citizen of the Year” list.

Marine veteran Taylor Weston commandeered a pickup truck and rushed victims of the Las Vegas massacre to the hospital. He did not make the list.

Nor did Stephen Willeford, the Texas plumber who grabbed a gun and ran barefoot towards the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. His actions stopped a mad man from killing even more innocent people.

The all-volunteer Cajun Navy did not make the list either. They pulled hundreds of citizens from the floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

And the hundreds of teenage football players who honored our flag and our troops by staging patriotic, pre-game celebrations did not make the list either.

GQ’s definition of what it means to be a good citizen and a good man and a hero is a bit puzzling.

One of the few upsides to the kneeling controversy engulfing the NFL is that it’s reinforced the notion that there are few things in this country more sacred than the lives of our military men and women. Public support for and confidence in the military remains astronomically high, buoyed by the enormous respect most Americans have for those who serve in uniform.

A little girl who was born with a life-threatening heart condition saw a big wish come true recently, when she was able to “marry” her best friend in a special playground ceremony. Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone, of Connecticut, has already undergone two open-heart surgeries and several other procedures, and had made the special request ahead of a third surgery, which is scheduled for January at Boston Children’s Medical Center, Yahoo reported.

On Oct. 23, Sophia and her best friend, Hunter, who she met in preschool, joined together on a playground and exchanged “vows” while photographer Marisa Balletti-Lavoie of Sassy Mouth Photo captured the precious images. The idea came from the pint-sized bride herself, and was happily agreed to by Hunter and his mom.

Sophia was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, which is a genetic heart defect involving four different issues, shortly after her birth. Sophia’s mother, Kristy Somerset-Chiappalone, started the “Sophia Elyssa Chiappalone the beautiful baby with a broken heart” Facebook page and explained that her daughter’s case is considered severe and will require several open-heart procedures before it is completely repaired. The condition is also likely to shorten her lifespan, and she will need a heart and lung transplant in the future.

“She’s a walking miracle,” Somerset-Chiappalone told NBC Connecticut. “There is no life expectancy at this time because there’s no reason for her to be alive.”

Balletti-Lavoie told Yahoo she was asked to do the shoot by Hunter’s mom, Tracy Laferriere, who is a close friend. Shortly after she shared photos of the pair on her Facebook page, their story went viral.

“I cannot help but be overwhelmed by the love and support we’ve gotten with Sophia and her recent wish,” Somerset-Chiappalone posted on her personal Facebook page, on Oct. 25. “It was pure innocence in the purest form. My heart aches with joy with the people standing behind Supergirl on this fight. She’s fought to be alive since her first breath, but that’s all she knows.

NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL: ALL PLAYERS ‘SHOULD’ STAND FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM

The commissioner currently is embattled with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has threatened to sue the NFL if negotiations regarding Goodell’s contract extension are finalized without approval from all NFL team owners.

An unnamed NFL owner told ESPN that there are “several owners in this league who don’t make $40 million a year.” The owner added: “That number for Roger just seems too much. It’s offensive. It’s unseemly.”

Goodell has made headlines in recent months for his handling of league players protesting during the national anthem ahead of NFL games.

He said last month that “we want our players to stand” during the anthem, but stopped short of imposing a rule for players to do so.

“Jones doesn’t fall in that category – he has a background as a prosecutor, he has linkage to Civil Rights prosecution for the bombers in Birmingham.","Before Roy Moore’s sexual assault allegations came to light, the Republican senate candidate was already a polarizing figure.

He’s argued that Muslims shouldn’t be able to serve in Congress; he promoted the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S.; he said in a 2005 interview that “homosexual conduct” should be illegal.

But even still, Steven Taylor, the political science chair at Alabama’s Troy University, thought voters in the deep red state of Alabama could look the other way.

“In some ways, that Roy Moore has a very strong religious element to his politics is not substantially out of the mainstream for the state,” Taylor told Fox News.

Then, slightly a month before the special election, the Washington Post released a bombshell report of allegations that Moore had inappropriate sexual conduct with teenage girls while he was in his 30s. One woman alleged that Moore had her touch him in private areas when she was just 14.

Moore has staunchly denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, but even still, many leading Republicans have called on him to step aside from the campaign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that he believed Moore’s accusers in asking him to “step aside” from the race.

Whether Moore heeds the calls or faces further fallout from those in his party has yet to be seen. Read on for a look at the special Senate election to replace Jeff Sessions.

Roy Moore, Republican

Called the “Ayatollah of Alabama” by critics who believe he too closely marries his political and judicial responsibilities with religion, Judge Roy Moore emerged as the leader of the Republicans vying for the Senate seat. In a special primary election last month, Moore defeated incumbent Sen. Luther Strange who was tapped to fill the position when then-Sen. Jeff Sessions became the U.S. attorney general.

In the primary, Moore, 70, garnered the support of conservative darlings, such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson. President Donald Trump backed Strange, but his former advisor, Steve Bannon, campaigned for Moore.

Moore’s political past is mired in controversy, which he used to his advantage during the primary election. He was twice removed from Alabama’s Supreme Court. The first time, he was removed when he refused to move a boulder-sized Ten Commandments monument from the statehouse; he was permanently suspended in 2016 after he instructed probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples.

The Supreme Court debacles worked in his favor given that Alabamians are generally very conservative and religious, Taylor said. And his refusal to bend to the federal government is in line with a “tradition” set in the state by the former longtime pro-segregationist Gov. George Wallace, he said.

“He’s very outspoken in a variety of ways,” Taylor said of Moore. “He’s a little more reflective of those more populistic candidates we’ve seen of late, including the president.”

After Moore’s primary victory, Trump tweeted that he spoke to Moore “for the first time,” calling him a “really great guy who ran a fantastic race.” Many Trump supporters turned out to campaign for Moore during the primary, despite the president’s backing of a different candidate.

ALABAMA PASTOR DEFENDS EMBATTLED ROY MOORE

Moore’s past took a backseat, however, when the Washington Post reported that four women accused Moore of engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior with them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.

Leigh Corfman, now 58, alleged that Moore first approached her in a courtroom in 1979 when she was 14 years old. Eventually, Moore took her to his house, took off her shirt and pants, touched her private parts and guided her hand to his underwear, she said. The two did not have sexual intercourse, and he took her home when she asked, Corfman said.

Moore has vehemently denied the accusations, calling them “baseless” and “the very definition of fake news.”

“It seems that in the political arena, to say that something is not true is simply not good enough. So let me be clear. I have never provided alcohol to minors, and I have never engaged in sexual misconduct,” Moore said in a statement provided to Fox News.

He also told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that he “generally” didn’t date women who were teenagers when he was in his 30s and would not date someone without their mother’s permission. And Moore admitted it’s possible that he did go on dates with one of the accusers in the Washington Post report who said she was 17 when Moore kissed her.

""He's very outspoken in a variety of ways.""

That line of defense is not “as strident or strong as one might expect,” Taylor said. “The question becomes: Does Mr. Moore come up with a more effective defense? Does he come up with a more coherent message to explain this story other than ‘fake news,’ although that does appeal to certain voters?”

Some polls immediately after the Washington Post’s report show an uptake in support for Moore’s Democratic counterpart, Doug Jones. But with Thanksgiving and big Alabama football games coming up, that could distract voters from the fallout of the allegations, Taylor said.

Doug Jones, Democrat

A former U.S. attorney during the Clinton administration, Jones beat out seven other Democrats to secure the party’s nomination.

Jones, 63, is perhaps best known for successfully prosecuting two members of the Ku Klux Klan accused of bombing a Birmingham church in 1963 that killed four young girls.

“I may have the honor of serving Alabama as your senator, but the most important thing I have done is prosecuting those klansmen who killed 4 little girls at 16th St Baptist Church,” Jones said in a tweet earlier this month.

Because of his resume, Taylor said he is considered to be a “quality candidate” in the political science world. He is “someone who is credible and therefore competitive,” Taylor said.

ROY MOORE SLAMS MCCONNELL, WASHINGTON POST AS CALLS TO LEAVE SENATE GROWS

“We’ve not seen a lot of quality Democratic candidates for Senate because Sen. [Richard] Shelby and Sen. Sessions, they were so strongly ensconced in their positions that the Democratic nominee was most often a more fringe candidate and not taken very seriously,” Taylor said. “Jones doesn’t fall in that category – he has a background as a prosecutor, he has linkage to Civil Rights prosecution for the bombers in Birmingham. This makes him a more serious and significant candidate.”

Openly critical of Trump, Jones has promised to fight for pro-abortion policies, tackling student loan debt and raising the minimum wage.

Even prior to the allegations of Moore groping a teenage girl, Democrats reportedly felt optimistic about Jones’ chances of winning in a historically red state. And after the allegations, some polls – such as the one produced by JMC Analytics – have Jones in the lead.

Jones has been endorsed by prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. His Twitter feed is riddled with photos of his campaign — from meeting with college students to discuss student loan debt to events with community leaders — but it doesn’t mention the allegations against Moore.

Alabama House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D, encouraged Jones to “stay the course” and not get bogged down with the allegations against Moore.

“Getting involved in the allegations, that doesn’t bring jobs to Alabama. That doesn’t bring opportunity or economic prosperity to our state. That doesn’t help education or health care. It doesn’t help our infrastructure,” Daniels told Fox News. “Why would he focus on that?”

Daniels also praised Jones for being “a fighter for his entire career.” He said Jones would bring “unity and civility” to the Senate and would work with lawmakers across the aisle to better Alabama.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone.
I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.
In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ.
Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.","“The older my kids get, the more I realize how little control I have over them. My slipping sense of control produces so much anxiety in my life so I end up grasping for even more control. I don’t know what else to do but I’m afraid to surrender. Really afraid.”

That was a very real and honest fear shared with me recently by another mom who is watching her eldest child navigate his teen years and is worried sick about his choices and the outcomes.

As I wrote about my own struggle with “controlling my kids” in my book “Mom Set Free,” I often wondered if surrender came easier to other moms. I wondered if I was mostly alone in my struggle to unclench my fists that were trying to control outcomes and parent more open-handed to God’s plans.

But based on an Instagram comment feed I scrolled through just last week, I know I am not alone. In fact, control seems to be something most moms struggle with.

Here are just six out of 132 comments shared by brave women and their struggle to surrender:

“I don’t even know what motherhood looks like without being worried, anxious and a total control freak!”

“My biggest fear is MY anxiety becoming THEIR anxiety.”

“I thought I’d moved past control issues once my kids got to school, but now they’re teens and it’s a real struggle to step back and give them their wings.”

“I’m such a control freak and it’s been a challenge not being able to control a single thing with my 5-week-old. Being on her schedule at all times has been the biggest struggle for me.”

“Mom guilt is real and life is crazy! Extra hard when you're a control freak.”

“I am anxious and worried way too often and want everything to be in perfect order. I need to be set free from those unhealthy mindsets!”

I can’t help but wonder if you can relate to any of these comments, because even if you wouldn’t describe yourself as a “control freak” you still might struggle with surrendering your kids to their sovereign Father.

I think part of our struggle is rooted in a misunderstanding of what surrender actually is.

One way we might think of surrender is this: “I give up. There is nothing I can do or say that is going to make a difference here. I’ve tried everything and nothing helps. My influence in my kid’s lives is useless and exhausted. I’m done trying. I surrender.”

But if we look to Jesus we find an entirely different lens through which to view surrender.

In the Gospel of Mark, chapter 14, we find that Jesus is “overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death” (v. 34 NIV). Jesus knew that the fulfillment of his mission was imminent. He would soon take on the sin of the world and bear the wrath and shame for the entire human race. Jesus was “deeply distressed and troubled” when he prayed: “Abba Father, everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will” (v. 36 NIV).

This simple but profound prayer shows us what surrender really is. Surrender is acknowledging God’s power, submitting to his will, and trusting in his goodness.

When we find ourselves grasping for control over our kid’s lives, or our own circumstances, we can pray like Jesus prayed to his Father: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

The above prayer, which my pastor Drew Williams shared at church many years ago, has expanded my heart and opened my hands to God’s perfect will in times when I have come to him very fearful and close-fisted.

This can be our prayer of surrender when:

Our hearts are aching and our fears are raging over the choices our kids are making.

We crash into the reality that our kids unique needs will seriously mess with our perfect plans.

We have so much anxiety over our role as moms that we witness our anxiety spilling over into our homes and onto our kids, who then take on our anxiety.

We feel helpless and hopeless.

This is a prayer that we probably need to pray over and over and over again, each and every day: “I know you can. I pray you would. Your will be done.”

Prayer is not only the antidote to finding peace amidst all of the anxiety-inducing pressure, but it is our most powerful weapon against the enemy who, like it or not, is working against us. He “prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV).

I don’t say this to scare us. I say this to encourage us to get on our knees in surrender and fight for our kids in prayer.

Our prayers for our children (and with our children) are unimaginably significant. Through prayer, we get to partner with God in the work he is doing in the lives of our kids, all the while remembering that: “It won’t be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ – eternal and glorious plans they are! – will have you put together and on your feet for good. He gets the last word; yes, He does!” (1 Peter 5:11 MSG).

In other words, as we pray for our kids, we can trust that God – who is abundantly generous – has great plans for our kids in Christ. And not just temporal plans, but eternal plans. And he gets the last word.

We can rest in his sovereignty and surrender to his will, just as we saw Jesus surrendering to his Father’s will in his prayer at Gethsemane. Jesus models this life of surrender for us, demonstrating that surrender is not a sign of weakness, but of strength.

Surrender isn’t giving up. It’s giving over every one of our fears and worries and problems and weaknesses to God. And in turn, receiving his peace as we partner with him, rather than trying to be him in our kid’s lives.

We have a profound role to play in our kid’s lives, by establishing healthy boundaries and enforcing consistent consequences, wrapped in unconditional love. But as we do that, we have to remember that we are not the originator and orchestrator of our kid’s lives.

Our role is to seek and surrender to “The Great Originator and Orchestrator” and trust him to be – and to do – everything we can’t. He’s good at that, you know. He’s good at being God. So let’s let him. And in doing so, we are enabled to release the anxiety and reclaim the adventure that we’ve lost in the quest to play his role.

God can be trusted with the kids he has entrusted to us.",God’s given us our children. Let’s trust Him and let go of our anxiety,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/29/god-s-given-us-our-children-let-s-trust-him-and-let-go-our-anxiety.html

According to a new report by The Atlantic on Monday, Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016.

“A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,” WikiLeaks reportedly wrote. “The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?”

According to The Atlantic, Trump Jr. replied, “Off the record I don’t know who that is, but I’ll ask around. Thanks.”

The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to congressional investigators by Trump Jr.’s attorneys.

“Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,” Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement. “Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.”

According to the report, these messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. reportedly ignored many ofthe messages.

President Trump’s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.’s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.

This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.

In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The meeting was brokered by music publicist Rob Goldstone who promised the campaign dirt. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was charged last month in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian collusion, also attended the meeting.

The Vermont-based creamery is on a mission to root out systemic racism from its customers – especially white ones.

The left-wing company, in a post on Oct. 24, accused its flavor enthusiasts of “implicit bias.”

While some thought it was a “new flavor” announcement, it was just a chance to push their progressive social agenda.

Customers reacted on social media:

“Did Ben and Jerry’s just call everyone racist?” Tom asked on Twitter.

“Worst ice cream advertisement ever,” Elliott Hamilton tweeted.

“You can only sell so much ice cream, but the appetite for pseudoscience knows no bounds,” Mark Hemingway wrote.

“What’s one thing Ben & Jerry’s and implicit bias research have in common? They’re both Half Baked,” Grant Addison tweeted.

The post is titled “What is implicit bias and what can we do about it?”

Ed Morrissey tweeted, “The actual answer appears to have eluded the ice cream manufacturer.”

They jump from cookie dough chunks mixed with brownie bites right to systemic racism:

“In the US, where most positions of power are still held by white people, ‘intergroup bias’ leads to racism,” the post reads, citing studies that “white-sounding names” do better than “black-sounding names” on resumes and when professors are answering students’ emails.

“Black drivers are pulled over more often by police, even though white drivers are more likely to have guns or drugs in the car,” the ice cream company claims.

They give employers, professors, and police officers a pass because the “evil racists doing evil racist things” is grown by “unexamined implicit biases.”

The cure for racism isn’t eating more Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, either.

The company encourages its customers to take a discredited Harvard’s “implicit bias test” that Hillary Clinton mentioned during a 2016 presidential debate against Trump, consider a seven-day “bias cleanse,” and watch a video from Demos Action President, Heather McGhee, who encourages a white caller to get to know black families who are not involved in crime or gangs, stop watching the nightly news, and join a black church.

“We are still a very, very segregated country,” McGhee said, “Millions of white Americans live in places where they rarely see anyone of a different race.”

This isn’t the first time Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield’s Vermont-based company has weighed in on social or political issues – supporting Black Lives Matter and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders with the limited-edition flavor called “Bernie’s Yearning.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it will cost about $234,000 in 2015 dollars to raise a child until he or she is 17 years old. That is not even including college. Child care costs are big-ticket items on this list.

Care.com, with New America, found the national average for the annual cost of child care is 31 percent of the median household income. The average cost of day care in the country is just under $200 per week per child. Hiring an after-school sitter for about 15 hours a week averages $214 per week. Employing a nanny is about $556 per week. This is the average – if you live in New York, California or Washington, D.C., you’ll likely pay more.

These are the kinds of costs that make families think twice about having more children – or any children at all. Mothers (and fathers) stay up at night worrying about the quality of care their children receive while they work to keep food on the table. And low-income and middle-class families are hit the hardest.

About three-quarters of all Americans believe it is better for families to have one parent home with children and just over 40 percent of American families strive to make that happen, either with a parent or close relative taking care of their young children. The word “strive” paints an accurate picture of the 10.4 million stay-at-home moms, because despite pervasive stereotypes, the majority of them are not wealthy women.

This is not about government coming to the rescue, but rather families keeping more of their hard-earned dollars. Pro-family tax reform is good for America, plain and simple. Abraham Lincoln stated: “The strength of a nation lies in the homes of its people.”

A pro-family tax structure encourages families to grow and allows parents the choice of staying at home to care for their children or getting a paying job. This freedom helps families build safe and secure homes, which in turn benefits the country as a whole.

On the policy side of tax reform, an increase in the child tax credit can provide relief to both families with working parents and families with a stay-at-home parent.

Child care subsidies can help with the expensive costs of day care and the like. But their benefits are limited to a small subset of the families that use those facilities, and not families that have a parent who stays home or families that are able to rely on other family members for full- or part-time child care.

Both political parties should be commended for wanting to meaningfully work on the federal level to help enable families choose the best option for quality care for their children, while working towards prosperity and a better life. But the solution cannot be more money thrown at problems that instead need thoughtful and creative ideas to benefit as many Americans as possible.

By increasing the child tax credit – now up to $1,000 annually for each child 16 and under – to a maximum of $2,500 a year per child, hardworking lower-income and middle-class parents will get the relief they need, putting more of their own money directly into their pockets.

This money will not just be available for child care but also for food, shelter and educational options like supplemental tutoring or sports programs. This ultimately has a multiplied impact – helping more families and allowing parents more choices, while encouraging economic equality.

President Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump has taken on the child tax credit issue, working closely with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Both would like to ensure that this reform is pro-family, because they understand that tax relief for families is an investment in America’s future.

As a mother who has both stayed at home and worked part-time or full-time, it is obvious that the more choices we have to provide for our families the better. Sadly, some moms do not have the opportunity to choose.

Congress should seize this historic opportunity to truly reform the tax system and make it pro-family. As part of that effort, forgotten families with children should be allowed to keep more of their own paychecks. This is an opportunity to make a life-changing difference in the lives of American families that are working hard every day to make ends meet.

Families are the crucial social institution tasked with safety and security and the inculcation of skills and values that create healthy, productive citizens necessary for the future of a thriving nation.

However, Amazon is apparently working on a completely free version of its Prime Video service, but it will be full of ads.

According to AdAge, Amazon is currently in talks with movie studios, media companies, and TV networks to plan content for a free video streaming service. Where as Prime subscribers pay $99 a year and gain access to Prime Video without adverts, this service wouldn't cost consumers a dime. In return for that free viewing experience, Amazon would surround content with advertising to cover the costs of the service.

Earlier this year, the number of Amazon prime subscribers went past 80 million, but that still leaves tens of million more who don't or even won't pay for access to streamed content. A free service may entice them to try Amazon's platform, at which point Amazon could regularly try and upsell them to a Prime subscription as well as introducing all the other perks paying for Prime offers. And don't forget, free viewers will likely still need to buy a Amazon Fire TV device to watch.

If this free service sounds like a return to regular ad-funded TV, think again. Amazon is apparently planning a much more lucrative deal to content owners. For example, it has been suggested Amazon will share advertising revenue with content creators by allowing them to setup their own channels and provide a set number of hours of content each week. We could effectively have the equivalent of YouTube, only each channel would be from an approved and established movie studio, TV network, or media company.

As to what content we should expect to see on a free Prime Video service, expect a little of everything from children's programming, travel, and cooking, to classic TV shows and the thousands of old movies the studios have to offer.

For now, Amazon is choosing not to comment and the focus remains on Prime subscriptions. If a free service does appear, do you think it will use the Prime Video name or some alternate and new branding?

The nonprofit ArchCity Defenders filed the federal lawsuit on behalf of seven former inmates seeking monetary damages and closure of the St. Louis Medium Security Institution, known as the Workhouse.

A spokesman for Mayor Lyda Krewson declined immediate comment.

Among those filing suit was 43-year-old James Cody of Jefferson City, who was jailed for eight months this year on a probation violation. He said he often found mouse feces in cake served at the jail. Jail staff would simply scrape off the feces, he said.

Cody said he was housed in a dorm with 69 other men, all sharing a single working toilet, sink and shower. He recalled the heat of summer, when temperatures inside the jail reached 125 degrees, according to the lawsuit. The hot conditions led to July protests that resulted in city officials temporarily bringing in portable air conditioners.

""I felt like I was treated like a dog,"" Cody said at a news conference before correcting himself. ""Dogs get treated better, to tell you the truth.""

Another former inmate, Diedre Wortham, was arrested on a decade-old traffic ticket and spent 22 days in the jail, she said. She says that after being hospitalized for high blood pressure, she was denied medicine for a week.

Wortham said she breathed through a T-shirt because of mold in the jail, and stuffed shirts under her cell door to keep mice out.

""I didn't think I was going to make it out of the Workhouse alive,"" Wortham said.

All seven plaintiffs are black. ArchCity Defenders said in the court filing that the vast majority of inmates at the jail are black, and virtually all of them are being held awaiting trial because they can't afford bail, mostly for non-violent crimes. A little over half of St. Louis' residents are black.

Blake Strode, an attorney for ArchCity Defenders, noted that the same jail was the subject of a lawsuit 40 years ago. He said the problems at the jail are further evidence of the way the St. Louis-area's criminal justice system is destructive to poor, black residents.

A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump.
But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally).","The Sunday “New York Times” published an op-ed that’s causing a stir: “Can My Children Be Friends With White People?”

It’s by Ekow N. Yankah, a Professor of Law at Cardozo. He’s an African-American who’s got sons, the eldest a four-year-old.

According to Yankah, Donald Trump’s election means he’ll have to teach his sons that racism will continue to be a deep part of the American character, and that they’ll have to learn to be suspicious. “Much sooner than I thought I would, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.”

He goes on to explain that real friendship only happens where there’s trust, and no desire to wield power over the other.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Surprisingly, Yankah claims his childhood in a “Midwestern college town [....] lacked the deep racial tension and mistrust that seem so hard to escape now.”

There’s tension today, yes, but there was tension a few decades ago when he was a kid — maybe he just didn’t notice.

How is it that the election of Trump, following Barack Obama’s two terms, was a turning point in race relations, even if it only supposedly revealed what was there all along? Nevertheless, with Trump if office, Yankah notes for many minorities “the ridiculous thing was thinking friendship was possible in the first place.”

According to Yankah, Trump’s essence is racist. For instance, when the President sees blacks protesting and he speaks out, it’s evidence that the President “cannot tolerate [that] the uppity do not stay in their place.”

But it’s more than Trump. It’s Trump’s supporters who have broken Yankah’s heart. (Though Yankah writes about white people, it should be noted almost 30 percent of Asians and Hispanics, and 8 percent of black people, voted for Trump. Also, millions of Obama voters pulled the lever for Trump.)

Yankah cannot excuse those who explain or apologize for what Trump says and does. The President’s designs are so obvious there can be no other interpretation.

While it may seem like Yankah is making an argument, what he’s doing is the opposite. He’s shutting off debate. He’s saying agree with me or be banished.

Not that he doesn’t feel bad about it: “I do not write this with liberal condescension or glee. My heart is unbearably heavy when I assure you we cannot be friends.”

Heavy heart or not, this is a disastrous attitude, in politics or in friendship. When others disagree, you should first try to understand them, rather than simply condemn them. Certainly there’s a decent chance you don’t fully grasp what they’re saying. And maybe, just maybe, you’re the one who’s mistaken.

In trying to explain the violence earlier this year in Charlottesville, Yankah told his four-year-old “Some people hate others because they are different.” His son replied “But I’m not different.”

His son’s response gives me hope, a lot more than the counsel of despair that Yankah has to offer.

Because if the solution is to shutter friendships, where does that leave us?

No one is saying Yankah has to agree with Trump. A whole lot of Trump voters don’t agree with Trump. But perhaps Yankah should actually engage with some Trump voters (though I wonder if he knows that many personally). He might discover they’re decent people.

He may even discover both Democrats and Republicans — all the way up to the president himself — want Americans of all races and ethnicities to do well.

Furthermore, maybe others will open up and understand him better, and the pain he feels when dealing with his children.

The country is having an argument right now, but it’s often not about the goal, but rather how to get there. And if you think the apologists for Trump are wrong, fine, try to explain to them why, rather than reading their minds and writing them off.

Four steps to take when deciding if you should let someone who betrayed you back into your life.

FOX's Ashley Papa has more:

Betrayal by a loved one is one of the most painful experiences. If you're thinking of letting someone who betrayed you back into your life, counselor, David Essel says first you must forgive:

""If you don't do this you're going to mistrust them, you're going to look for problems when maybe there aren't any, the other big problem you run into is that if this relationship doesn't work out and you want to move on and you haven't forgiven them you're going to put the next person you date on the cross.""

Step two is to own your role in the dysfunction of the relationship. The third step is to have the betrayer write you an apology letter:

""So in other words if someone says i'm so sorry for cheating on you, i'm so sorry i stole money from you that's not enough. I went them to write down the specific things they did who they did them with and why. See, that means they're sincere about coming back in and earning back your trust.""

Fourth, Essel says if they stole something they must pay you back. If they don't do step three or four- let them go.

Costas, the longtime NBC broadcaster, said at the University of Maryland on Tuesday that the one-time “cash machine” sport was suffering after multiple investigations into former players who've experienced serious health issues, USA Today reported.

“The reality is that this game destroys people’s brains,"" Costas said. “Not everyone, but a substantial number. That’s the fundamental fact of football, and that to me is the biggest story in American sports.”

Costas was referring to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease linked with repeated head trauma that has become a concern for many athletes, but mostly those playing in the NFL.

An NBC Sports spokesperson told The New York Daily News, ""Bob’s opinions are his own, and they do not represent those of the NBC Sports Group.""

In a July report, researchers studying the brains of 202 former football players discovered traces of CTE in nearly all of them, The Associated Press reported.

Late New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez suffered substantial damage to parts of the brain that affect memory, judgment and behavior from the most severe case of a degenerative disease linked to head blows ever found in someone so young, a researcher said Thursday.

BOB COSTAS WARNS FUTURE OF FOOTBALL IS BLEAK BECAUSE SPORT 'DESTROYS PEOPLE'S BRAINS'

Dr. Ann McKee, director of Boston University's CTE Center, stressed she could not ""connect the dots"" between the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the behavior of the 27-year-old who hanged himself in April while serving life in prison for murder.

But McKee said CTE had significantly impacted key parts of Hernandez's brain, including the hippocampus -- which is associated with memory -- and the frontal lobe, which is involved in impulse control, judgment and behavior.

""We can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE — and CTE of this severity — have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses or aggression, often emotional volatility and rage behaviors,"" said McKee, who has studied hundreds of brains from football players, college athletes and even younger players, donated after their deaths.

In his speech last week at the University of Maryland, Costas said “the cracks in the foundation are there.""

“The day-to-day issues, as serious as they may be, they may come and go. But you cannot change the nature of the game. I certainly would not let, if I had an athletically gifted 12- or 13-year-old son, I would not let him play football,"" he told the group.

Costas appeared on the Maryland panel with USA Today’s Christine Brennan and ESPN's Tony Kornheiser, each of whom spoke about the future of professional football.

“It’s not going to happen this year, and it’s not going to happen in five years or ten years,"" Kornheiser said. ""But Bob is right: At some point, the cultural wheel turns just a little bit, almost imperceptibly, and parents say, ‘I don’t want my kids to play.’ And then it becomes only the province of the poor, who want it for economic reasons to get up and out.""

Costas said the NFL’s belated efforts to study the dangers of football will only hurt the league in the end.

“The more information [that] comes out, the worse it looks,” Costas said.

STARS WHO PASSED ON CHICAGO

Richard Gere won a Golden Globe for his role as Billy Flynn in the movie, but he wasn’t always the first choice to play the charming lawyer.

Hugh Jackman told The Hollywood Reporter that he was offered the part, but passed because he felt he was too young.

John Travolta also turned down the role and later told Entertainment Tonight that it’s a decision he regrets.

“Probably the one I didn’t explore enough is Chicago,” Travolta said.

“Harvey Weinstein offered it to me three times. I never met with the director because I thought the play was about a bunch of women who hated men, and I like women who like men.”

The role was eventually offered to Gere who told the BBC that he wasn’t that keen on it at first.

“Actually, it was my agent who was pushing for it much more than I was,” Gere said.

“I was a little resistant because I wasn’t that taken with the stage production. But my agent just really kept pushing. I had just done a very intense movie, ""Unfaithful,"" and I thought: ‘At the very least I’m going to have fun doing this.'""

Harvey Weinstein was still the co-chairman of Miramax Films when ""Chicago"" was being made. And the now disgraced movie mogul was adamant at the time that Britney Spears should be given a role in the movie.

According to The New York Times, Weinstein sent three Miramax execs to pitch the idea to Spears backstage at a concert in Canada.

But director Rob Marshall and other producers were “dead set against having someone they regarded as a fluffy, pubescent pop star in a role that required a brutal edge,” the NY Times claimed in 2003.

Eventually Weinstein relented and the offer was never made to Spears.

CHARLIZE THERON GOT DUMPED

Renée Zellweger was nominated for an Oscar for playing Roxie Hart in the 2002 movie, but she only landed the role after Charlize Theron was booted from the film.

“I was attached to 'Chicago' for a while,” Theron explained earlier this year to Howard Stern.

“I was a dancer for most of my life and there was a real nostalgia in making that movie for me. But I got kicked off it. The director kicked me off. I was really bummed about it.”

Theron said she was dumped from the film when the original director left the project before shooting began, replaced with successful musical director Rob Marshall.

“He didn’t want to make the movie with me,” Theron told Stern.

The ""Monster"" star went on to praise Zellweger’s performance in the film, saying, “She did an amazing job, I’m fully envious of what she did.”

THE REAL REASON ZETA-JONES HAD A BOB

Catherine Zeta-Jones worked her butt off to prepare for her role as Velma Kelly and it certainly paid off when she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

The dance sequences were so demanding during shooting that Zeta-Jones was “black and blue up and down her thighs,"" according to her hubby Michael Douglas.

At one stage it was suggested that her character should have long hair in the film, but Zeta-Jones shot it down for a very specific reason.

“She said: ‘If you think I’m going to have long hair over my face so anyone is going to think that I’m being doubled and not doing every darn step, you’re crazy,'"" producer Martin Richards told People.

OSCARS SNUB

""Chicago"" was nominated for 12 Academy Awards. Renée Zellweger was nominated for Best Actress, John C. Reilly was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

The only big name star from the movie who wasn’t nominated was Richard Gere, and he was definitely “bothered” by the snub.

OSCARS PERFORMANCE

""Chicago"" went on to win six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Catherine Zeta-Jones and Best Art Direction.

The movie was also nominated for Best Original Song for ""I Move On"" which is performed in the film by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renée Zellweger.

The two actresses were asked to perform the song at the Oscars but Zellweger passed, telling Entertainment Weekly at the time that she wouldn’t be comfortable singing live in front of such a large audience.

Queen Latifah, who plays Matron “Mama” Morton in Chicago, saved the day though and performed the song at the Academy Awards with a heavily pregnant Zeta-Jones who gave birth 10 days later.

Franzese took to Facebook and wrote in a long post that the mistreatment occurred on the set of their movie “Bully.”

“She body shamed me and ridiculed me about my sexuality and physically assaulted me,” Franzese wrote about being on set for the movie released in 2001. “I was scared and closeted and feared for my job. It started with a lot of eye‪ rolling whenever we spoke but‪ escalated when we did a cast shoot for the poster‪. ‪As we were shooting she kept loudly saying ‘Are you gay?!’ and laughing‪ while the producers‪ and photographer did nothing‪ to stop her.”

“[S]he continued to say ‘Are You Gay?!’ Like 10 times making sure to be loud enough for everyone to hear I reluctantly told her i was bi,” Franzese wrote. “Which at the time was how I was choosing to‪ identify as ‘Q’ wasn’t known to be an option yet and to be honest I don’t know that I had many gay experiences at the time my life. I was an extremely late bloomer. She cackled and‪ said ‘HA! He’s bi!’ And then when I showed up to work the next day in front of the crew she was screaming ‘Oh look! The Bi guy is here!’”

Phillips apologized to her co-star saying she doesn't ""remember that time well, those years are a blur.""

She told TMZ in a statement, ""I was a teenager and reckless in my behavior...I know Daniel to be a trustworthy and honest person, and to find out through social media that I was not the friend I thought I was to him made me so sad.""

She also said, ""I am so mortified by this behavior and have contacted Daniel and apologized to him privately. I am not and never have been homophobic. I have nothing but love for the LGBTQ community and Daniel.""

Franzese also said that Phillips, whose father was musician John Phillips, bullied him when he had a shirtless scene: “an extremely vulnerable moment for me,” he said, calling himself “the chubby kid who wore his shirt in the pool.”

“Later she pulled me aside and said ‘I’m sorry if I offended you. You actually remind me of someone.’ She said Carnie Wilson who is in her sisters band Wilson Phillips at the time was well know for her weight issues in the media. It was meant to be a insult,” Franzese added. “She then grabbed my nipple and twisted it hard through my shirt and laughed and walked away. I stopped talking to her for the rest of filming.”

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Franzese said during a later scene, while she was sitting behind him, she “kept rubbing her dirty feet on my neck. I kept swiveling the chair to move away from her and she kicked me as hard as she could in the back of the head. To this day I’m not even sure if she gave me a concussion because I was light headed and dizzy for a while.”

A representative for Phillips did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Phillips is the wife of Danny Masterson, the actor most known for his role as Steven Hyde in the popular series “That ‘70s Show.” Masterson was accused of rape by four women in the early 2000s, allegations which resurfaced last week, Fox News previously reported. Masterson has denied the accusations against him.","Bijou Phillips accused by actor Daniel Franzese of assault, bullying",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/11/13/bijou-phillips-accused-by-actor-daniel-franzese-assault-bullying.html
