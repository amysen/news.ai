Ross had originally intended to retain his shipping interests following his confirmation in February. But the 79-year-old investor came under criticism after disclosures on Sunday that one of Navigator’s major clients is the Russian gas company Sibur, a firm whose owners include members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

Information about the business ties between Navigator, which operates gas-carrying ships, and Sibur was based on leaked documents from offshore law firm Appleby that are part of the so-called Paradise Papers, which show details of business dealings by wealthy people and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“He began divesting his Navigator interests in May,” the administration official said of Ross. “He is nearing completion of that process.”

An office of government ethics disclosure filed by Ross on June 20 showed that he sold an interest in Navigator valued at $15,001 to $50,000 on May 30.

The official did not provide an explanation for Ross’s divestitures. Ross had owned stakes in the firms through several partnerships.

Ross, a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy, had told U.S. senators during his confirmation hearing in January that his research showed that retention of shipping interests would not present a conflict of interest. U.S. ocean shipping regulation is handled by the Federal Maritime Commission, a separate, independent agency.

Diamond S Shipping, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, operates 33 petroleum product tankers and 12 crude oil tankers operated under the flags of Hong Kong, the Marshall Islands and Malta.

Ross told media on Monday that he had nothing to do with London-based Navigator’s relationship with Sibur and had never met any of Sibur’s owners. These include Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate who is subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions.

U.S. Treasury yields edged higher but the yield curve remained close to its flattest level in a decade, potentially cutting into the profits of banks.

Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow while Bank of America weighed on the S&P. The S&P financial sector led the decliners, falling 0.7 percent.

Analysts said a flattening yield curve at a time when the Federal Reserve is hiking rates is a sign that investors are wary about the sustainability of economic growth and inflation in the world’s biggest economy.

Investors are also nervous about the potential outcome of a Republican plan to cut corporate taxes, unveiled last week. As well as slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the bill would eliminate many tax breaks and is expected to face opposition from interest groups.

Senate Republican leaders are considering a one-year delay in the implementation of a major corporate tax cut to comply with Senate rules, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources.

“I do expect the tax bill to be watered down,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.

“My concern is that the market has fully factored in that a tax bill is going to come to pass and this is still a very difficult road to get this done and there’s not a whole lot of time.”

Republicans are yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

The S&P has risen about 21 percent since the election of President Donald Trump, partly on the back of his promises to cut taxes and other business-friendly measures.

Islamic State has been all but destroyed over the past two years, remaining only in Albu Kamal in Syria, Rawa in Iraq, in a few neighboring villages and patches of desert, and some isolated pockets elsewhere.

At the height of its power in 2015, it ruled over an expanse of the two countries, eradicating their border, printing money, imposing draconian laws and plotting attacks across the world.

On Wednesday, the army and its allies surrounded Albu Kamal and started to enter it, the pro-Hezbollah al-Manar television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, reported that Iraqi militias had crossed into Syria to join the assault, but they denied it.

Despite its losses, Islamic State still has a territorial presence in Libya and elsewhere, and many governments expect it to remain a threat even after it loses the caliphate it declared from Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.

It has already carried out a series of guerrilla operations in both Iraq and in Syria, and it has continued to inspire lone militants to attack civilian targets in the West.

In Syria, the end of major battle operations against Islamic State may only prefigure a new phase of the war, as the rival forces which have seized territory from the jihadists square off.

The Syrian army, alongside its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias, and backed by Iran and Russia, have seized swathes of central and eastern Syria in an advance against Islamic State this year.

Russian official media have in recent weeks reported a surge of strategic bombing and cruise missile strikes on Islamic State targets in eastern Syria as the army advanced.

A U.S.-backed coalition has supported a rival campaign in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that have pushed Islamic State from much of the country’s north and east.

NEW PHASE

The Syrian government has sworn to recapture territory held by the SDF, including Islamic State’s former capital Raqqa and oil and gas fields lying east of the Euphrates.

In areas controlled by the SDF in northern Syria, Kurdish-led groups have established autonomy, announcing elections and setting internal policies.

On Tuesday, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, described the U.S. forces aiding the SDF in Syria as illegal invaders. Washington has not spelled out how its military support for the SDF would evolve after Islamic State’s defeat.

Shaaban also pointed, in a television interview, to the example of Iraq, where the government retaliated against an autonomous Kurdish region after it held an independence referendum.

Iraqi military officials say small groups of Islamic State militants are still entrenched in the town of Rawa and the border desert strip with Syria. Scattered villages near al-Qaim, close to Albu Kamal, are still under militant control in an area called Rummana.

The Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an alliance of militias, denied a report by the Observatory that it had crossed the Syrian border and was attacking Albu Kamal.

“Our movements are carried out under orders from the commander in chief of the armed forces and our key objective is to liberate Iraq’s territories from Daesh. We have no orders to cross the borders,” PMF spokesman Ahmed al-Asadi said.",Syrian army starts assault on last IS stronghold,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-islamic-state/syrian-army-starts-assault-on-last-is-stronghold-idUSKBN1D81NM

Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, are charged with conspiring with four North Korean fugitives to kill the North Korean leader’s half-brother using banned chemical weapon VX, at the Kuala Lumpur international airport on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers say the women were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a reality TV show.

Closed circuit television recordings played in court on Wednesday showed three of the fugitives at the airport in a car registered to a North Korean suspect named Ri Jong Chol.

Jong Chol, who was arrested and deported shortly after the murder, told investigators the car had been bought in his name by a North Korean embassy official named Chal Su in October 2016, lead investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz said.

“We made a request to the North Korean embassy to identify and question Chal Su, but did not receive any cooperation,” Wan Azirul told the court.

Airport video recordings screened in court earlier showed the embassy’s second secretary and a manager for North Korean airline Air Koryo helping the four fugitives flee immediately after the murder.

Wan Azirul on Wednesday named the two individuals as North Korean embassy second secretary Hyon Kwang Song and Air Koryo manager Kim Uk Il.

Both men had gone into hiding at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, along with Ri Ji U, a 30-year-old North Korean also known as James, after warrants were issued for their arrest, Wan Azirul said.

Police took statements from the embassy’s second secretary and the Air Koryo official before releasing them, but did not pursue Ji U or Chal Su in the absence of instructions to do so, Wan Azirul said.

“During this probe, which involves international issues, I faced many constraints in investigating and needed to refer to my superior officers before taking any action,” he added.

North Korea has vehemently denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some South Korean lawmakers have said.

The murder unraveled once-close ties between Malaysia and North Korea.

The details of the stake, revealed by Snapchat after badly received quarterly results, came as U.S. and Chinese firms announced $9 billion in new deals on the arrival of President Donald Trump in Beijing.

It helped the U.S. company recoup a slide of almost 20 percent in pre-trading in New York after it reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations.

Snap shares recovered to trade down 12 percent at $13.29 in premarket trading from a close of $15.12 on Tuesday.

Snap’s largely privately owned structure, which reserves 95 percent of voting rights for its co-founders, made it likely Tencent was just accumulating a financial stake.

“While such news may be initially perceived as positive by the market, one has to remember that Tencent’s holdings in Snap is the non-voting Class A shares, which makes a possible acquisition of Snap by Tencent less likely,” said Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.

Along with Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent has poured billions of cash from a decade of growth in China into buying U.S. firms and holds 5 percent of electric car maker Tesla, as well as stakes in ride service company Lyft and augmented reality startup Magic Leap.

The largest social media and gaming company in China and owner of the popular mobile application WeChat, it had previously invested in Snap through an affiliate in 2013, and has been referred as a “role model” by Snap’s co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel.

Snap said in its quarterly report that Tencent had bought 145.8 million shares of its non-voting Class A common stock on the open market. Snap had about 1.2 billion shares outstanding, as of Oct 31.(bit.ly/2zqvybE)

“The positive side of this could be that the two companies may create business partnership of some kind or Tencent may aid Snap in expanding its reach into China,” Morningstar’s Mogharabi said.

Unlike many U.S. stock market-listed corporations, Snap is not obligated to disclose changes in Tencent’s ownership of Snap’s Class A stock. Snap said it had only received the details of the stake from Tencent this month and declined to answer further questions on the filing.

Snap, on Tuesday, reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations, as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s Instagram. The company has disappointed investors each quarter since it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March.

Snap’s daily active users (DAU) stood at 178 million, below expectation of 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

“As evidenced by China’s Tencent taking a 10 percent plus stake in Snap this morning, there is clear inherent value in the company’s about 180 million DAU, strong engagement numbers, and growing international social media platform,” GBH Tech Research analyst Dan Ives said.",Snap says China's Tencent holds 12 percent stake,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-tencent-stake/snap-says-chinas-tencent-holds-12-percent-stake-idUSKBN1D81G3?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

Documents leaked in the so-called “Paradise Papers” trove of offshore records shed light on a previously undisclosed deal with the Dutch government that gave P&G an estimated tax break of $169 million.

P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers, Gillette razors and Tide laundry detergent, issued a statement on Tuesday denying involvement in any form of tax avoidance.

And while there are no allegations the arrangement was in any way improper, the Dutch deputy minister for finance acknowledged in a letter to parliament on Tuesday that the deal, which was signed off on by a single inspector, should have been vetted by an entire team.

“Not following prescribed procedures is unacceptable,” said Menno Snel in the letter. “Therefore I have given the order to investigate whether ... more than 4,000 international rulings were issued in conformity with the guidelines.”

He said the investigation would be complete by year end.

The new Dutch government must walk a delicate line as it attempts to satisfy allies and critics it is taking steps to reform abusive tax practices - while at the same time defending its attractiveness as a place for multinationals to do business.

Expertise on tax advice, consulting on legal structures, accountancy and legal counseling are all seen as key competencies for the Netherlands.

But its reputation has been hurt by a wave of protectionist sentiment that had a hand in derailing a bid by U.S. paint maker PPG Industries for Dutch coatings and chemicals firm Akzo Nobel.

BREXIT BONUS

The P&G deal was an “Advance Price Agreement”, a deal wherein a tax authority approves in advance prices one branch of a company charges another when they do business. Multinationals value the certainty APAs and other advance tax rulings bring, while critics say they are often used to shift profits into zero tax jurisdictions.

Tax campaigners say that the Netherlands and Luxembourg specifically rubber-stamp such deals in order to attract investment and jobs. In addition, such deals are also often not available to smaller or less sophisticated firms.

In 2015, the European Commission said the Netherlands had given Starbucks an unreasonably generous APA tax ruling, which helped encourage the company establish its European headquarters in the country. It ordered The Hague to recoup 30 million euros ($35 million) from the company, a decision the government is contesting.

According to data published by the European Commission, EU members granted 978 APAs to EU companies in 2015. The Netherlands granted 236 of these. Belgium gave 474 and Luxembourg granted 145.

The Paradise Paper revelations come at an awkward time for the Dutch government, which said at its installation just last month it would take new measures to crack down on mailbox companies and combat use of the Netherlands as a conduit to tax havens.

Among other measures, the country introduced a tax on royalties when payments are sent to low-tax jurisdictions.

However, in an bid to win over companies seeking new EU bases once Britain leaves the bloc -- which have so far mostly chosen bases elsewhere in Europe -- Prime Minister Mark Rutte has announced a plan to scrap any withholding tax on dividends.

The government has also promised to lower its tax rate to 21 percent from 25 percent to further woo foreign firms.

“The cabinet is working to create an attractive environment that benefits companies with actual activities in the Netherlands, and is also tackling tax avoidance,” Snel said.

The opposition Green Left party said the measures being adopted did not go far enough.

“The Paradise Papers show that the Netherlands still plays a major role in global tax evasion,” Green Left lawmaker Tom van der Lee.

The Paradise Papers are leaked documents from prominent offshore law firm Appleby that relate to the investments of wealthy individuals and institutions ranging from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth.

Oil companies and activists hope it will be a blueprint for wider rehabilitation but other badly polluted communities are unhappy not to be included.

Earlier this month, crews of young men equipped with high pressure hoses began to attack the crude oil that has blighted the creeks and mangrove swamps in the area where they live.

The workers from Bodo in Rivers State are beginning a three-year project that claims to mark a new approach to cleaning up the delta, the vast polluted swampland that pumps the oil vital to Africa’s largest economy.

Four hundred workers will clear dead foliage and spilled oil before planting new mangroves. The site where they are working is small but organizers hope the anti-pollution drive can be repeated elsewhere in the delta.

Unlike clean-up operations run routinely by oil giant Royal Dutch Shell, this one is backed by local communities and teams of scientists who will take samples of water, mud and soil in each area to measure progress and determine the best cleaning method.

Funded by Shell and its joint venture partners, the clean-up is the culmination of years of legal wrangling and international pressure to overcome animosity and mutual suspicion that have divided locals, the government and oil companies.

Shell declined to say how much it was spending on the effort, whose leaders see it as a glimmer of hope in a benighted land where many wells are not safe to drink from and fishing and farming have been devastated.

“The Niger Delta is at a crossroads,” said Inemo Samiama, chairman of the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is managing the clean-up. “We have a lot of polluted sites. We need something that we can refer to, some shining example.” HOPE AND POLLUTION The work of the BMI covers 10 sq km, a tiny fraction of the 70,000 sq km Delta.

As the workers walk through gnarled, dead mangrove roots in their protective gear and masks, oil seeps into their footprints – remnants of 2008 spills for which Royal Dutch Shell admitted responsibility. Despite the optimism, environmentalists point out that at BMI’s work rate, it will take 21,000 years to clean the entire delta, and that’s not including the 10 years of legal battles it took to make it happen.

Communities in the other eight Delta states are also unhappy they have no clean-up plan, fuelling the resentment that underpinned the militant movements that hit production last year and helped tip Nigeria into its first recession in 25 years.

Already one group, the Niger Delta Avengers, has threatened a return to violence. They say the government is not keeping its promises to clean up the delta and provide more jobs, money and infrastructure.

Other groups who do not advocate violence are also frustrated.

“No clean-up whatsoever has taken place,” said Deinbo Owanaemi Emmanuel, attorney for the Bille kingdom, also in Rivers but outside the clean-up area. “People are dying. People are being denied justice.”

COURTS AND NOTORIETY Bodo received support from British law firm Leigh Day, which negotiated a 55 million pound pollution settlement with Shell in 2015. Leigh Day said it agreed to freeze a separate case to force a clean-up via British courts in order to give the BMI a chance.

Ogoni, the wider area in which Bodo sits, was the subject of a 2011 UN Environment Programme report warning of catastrophic pollution in the soil and water.

King Emere Godwin Bebe Okpabi of the Ogale community is on the board of a wider Ogoni clean-up effort, and is optimistic its own clean-up, due to start next year, will work. But he fears it will not replicated elsewhere without another marathon battle in the London courts.

“The only place you can get legal success is the international courts,” he said.

Under Nigerian law, oil companies must begin cleaning up any spill within 24 hours. But the remoteness of spills and lax enforcement mean this rarely happens.

Ferdinand Giadom, a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt and technical advisor to the Bodo cleanup, said communities often block clean-ups in the hopes of cash settlements. Even in Bodo, works were delayed by two years due to local infighting.

Shell said most oil spilled last year was due to sabotage or theft for illegal refining. It also said that communities block access to sites, making cleaning more difficult.",Anger seethes on margins of historic clean-up in Nigeria's Delta,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D81WJ-OZATP

Ihre “Ich will das”-Äußerung zu Jamaika in der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktionssitzung am Montag wiegt deshalb nach Ansicht aus Unionskreisen umso stärker. Kurze Zeit später fügte die Kanzlerin dann noch in einem Video-Podcast hinzu, dass sie mit der Sondierung bis zum 16. November fertig sein möchte. Die verbale Offensive und Festlegung steht in merkwürdigem Kontrast zur Rolle, die Merkel und die CDU bisher in diesen Jamaika-Sondierungen gespielt haben. Nach außen behakten sich vor allem FDP, Grüne und CSU, während die Christdemokraten weitgehend schwiegen. Sogar bei den bisherigen Auftritten der Generalsekretäre spielte der CDU-Vertreter eher den ausgleichenden Part - was nicht immer auf Zustimmung stößt.

Alle Teilnehmer der Jamaika-Sondierung wissen aber, dass Merkel ein übergeordnetes Ziel hat: Sie will zum vierten Mal zur Kanzlerin gewählt werden. Da sich die SPD bereits in die Opposition verabschiedet hat, scheint ihr Schicksal an einer erfolgreichen Sondierung und einem Bündnis der vier ungleichen Partner zu hängen. Dem Hinweis “Ich will das” könnte man also ein “Das muss gelingen” hinzufügen - was Merkels eigene Verhandlungsposition nicht unbedingt stärkt. Sie sei am stärksten darauf angewiesen, dass alle Partner mitspielten, heißt es parteiübergreifend bei den Sondierern. Basta-Positionen verbieten sich deshalb.

LANGE GRUPPENSITZUNGEN MACHT PARTEIEN NERVÖS

In der Union wird die erste Phase der Gespräche mit einer Gruppentherapie verglichen. Merkel ließ die Protagonisten einfach reden. Die Folge des vereinbarten Rahmens war, dass sich die Sondierer zwei Wochen darüber unterhielten und aufregten, was die anderen Parteien sich wünschten. “Erst mal reden lassen - Merkel kennt dieses Verfahren aus Brüssel, aus den EU-Verhandlungen”, sagt CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer dazu. Das sei ein Mittel, um unterschiedliche Politiker aneinander zu gewöhnen - und die Erkenntnis sacken zu lassen, dass man Kompromisse eingehen müsse.

Der doppelte Nachteil dieser Strategie: In der vergangenen Woche machte sich bei Seehofer selbst, aber auch etwa beim dem Grünen-Unterhändler Robert Habeck Ungeduld breit. So könne es nicht weitergehen, schimpften immer mehr Sondierer. Die Kanzlerin müsse ihre abwartende Haltung endlich aufgeben und mal steuern statt moderieren. “Mich nervt das, wieviel Zeit wir hier miteinander verbringen, um uns anzunähern, obwohl allen vernünftigen Menschen klar sein muss, auf welche Kompromisslinien man sich einigen muss”, beklagte ein ungeduldiger FDP-Unterhändler Wolfgang Kubicki am Dienstag.

Merkel habe nur selten selbst eingegriffen, erzählen die Sondierer: So habe sie etwa die Debatte einmal beendet, als CSU-Jamaika-Skeptiker Alexander Dobrindt den Grünen wieder einmal den Abbruch der Gespräche angedroht habe, hieß es. Ein anderes Mal habe sie den Grünen klar gemacht, dass das Wort “Kohleausstieg” in keinem Sondierungspapier auftauchen werde. Und sie sorgte auch mit dafür, dass die Ablehnung des Euro-Zonen-Budgets aus Rücksicht auf Frankreichs Präsident Emmanuel Macron erst einmal nicht in den Sondierungspapieren auftauchte.

Ansonsten, so berichten Teilnehmer, lasse Merkel die anderen sondieren und etwa Kanzleramtschef Peter Altmaier Druck aufbauen. Insgesamt sorge sie für gute Stimmung mit launigen humorvollen Bemerkungen, heißt es. Nur reiche dies in der nun begonnenen zweiten Phase eben nicht mehr aus. “Eine Regierung kann man nicht aus einem Potpourri von Fragen entwickeln”, warnt etwa Dobrindt. Also wächst der Druck auf die Kanzlerin, die Gespräche stärker zu steuern und Lösungen durchzusetzen.

“WAS HAT SIE EIGENTLICH HERAUSGEHOLT?”

Das zweite Problem: In der CDU wird durchaus kritisch gefragt, wo denn die eigene Profilierung in den Sondierungen bleibe. Die Rechts-Links-Kursdebatte nach dem schlechten CDU-Bundestagswahlergebnis ist zwar wieder etwas eingeschlafen. Bis auf einige Rechts-Außen etwa aus der sächsischen CDU wird auch Merkel nicht infrage gestellt, wozu ihre weiter guten persönlichen Umfragewerte beitragen.

Aber das Misstrauen einiger parteiinternen Kritiker sitzt tief, dass Merkel zu große Zugeständnisse machen könnte - während FDP, Grüne und CSU für ihre Interessen kämpften. Um das Misstrauen zu dämpfen, betonte die CDU-Chefin deshalb in Präsidium und Bundesvorstand der Partei am Montag ausdrücklich, auch sie werde nicht jeden Koalitionsvertrag unterschreiben. Das kam nach Teilnehmerangaben zunächst ebenso gut an wie ihr Hinweis, dass CDU und CSU bis auf die Frage der Mütterrente wirklich an einem Strang zögen. Aber ähnlich wie Seehofer dürfte auch Merkel bei der CDU-Klausurtagung Mitte November kritisch gefragt werden, was sie eigentlich für ihre Partei bei den Verhandlungen herausgeholt habe, heißt es in der CDU.","ANALYSE-Jamaika-Gruppentherapeutin Merkel - ""Ich will das""",https://www.reuters.com/article/deutschland-koalition-cdu-idDEKBN1D80RH

In a specially equipped pen, sheep were shown pictures of people on two computer screens, on one side would be an unknown person and on the other would be one of four celebrities.

The animal would receive a reward of food for choosing the photograph of the celebrity by breaking an infrared beam near the screen displaying it. If they chose the wrong photograph, a buzzer would sound and they would receive no reward.

The sheep eventually managed to identify the familiar face eight times out of every 10.

The group of celebrities the sheep were trained to recognize included actors Emma Watson and Jake Gyllenhaal, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce and Obama.

“We’ve shown that sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable with those of humans and monkeys,” Professor Jenny Morton, who led the study, said in a statement.

In addition to being shown images of the celebrities facing forward, scientists also tested the animals’ ability to recognize the faces in photographs taken from other angles.

The animals’ success rate fell by around 15 percent when presented with the faces at a new angle, an amount researchers said was comparable to that seen when humans perform the task.

The 30-year-old Scot has been sidelined with a hip problem since Wimbledon but returned to the court for a charity event in Glasgow, losing a three-set match to a kilt-wearing Roger Federer on Tuesday.

“My hip felt pretty good, not perfect yet but it’s going in the right direction,” Murray said after the relaxed one-hour, 40-minute hit with Federer.

“I’ve got eight weeks until my first tournament of next year and hopefully I’ll be there.”

The Dec. 31-Jan. 7 Brisbane International, which will feature world number one Rafa Nadal among other top players, is a key warm-up to the year’s first grand slam, which starts at Melbourne Park a week later.

Murray, whose ranking has slipped to 16, said he planned to do his usual pre-season training bloc in Miami before arriving in Australia early.

“Obviously coming into the beginning of the New Year I will be at a bit of a disadvantage because I have not played matches for a long time,” he told British media.

“So if I can go there a little bit earlier to get used to the conditions, a bit sooner than some of the other players, that might help level it up a little bit for me.”

Caution is the watchword for the Scot, who admitted he had erred in trying to play the U.S. Open in August rather than resting his troublesome hip.

He ended up pulling out two days before the tournament.

“I made probably a bit of a mistake trying to get ready for the U.S. Open but it was the last major of the year and I wanted to give it a go,” he said. “Now I’ve had time to give my body the rest and recovery it needs.”

The three-times grand slam champion felt confident, however, that he would be able to get back to his best tennis.

Addressing supporters at the headquarters of his ZANU-PF party in Harare, 93-year-old Mugabe accused Emmerson Mnangagwa of consulting witchdoctors and prophets as part of a campaign to secure the presidency.

Mnangagwa said he had fled Zimbabwe because of death threats and was safe.

“My sudden departure was caused by incessant threats on my person, life and family by those who have attempted before through various forms of elimination including poisoning,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.

The head of the influential war veterans association, Chris Mutsvangwa, said that Mnangagwa, who was sacked on Monday, would travel to Johannesburg in neighboring South Africa “very soon”.

Mugabe said Mnangagwa, nicknamed “Crocodile”, had made the same mistakes as Joice Mujuru, who was the president’s deputy for 10 years until she was fired in 2014.

“You should not try to say because the journey is long, then I should take a short cut to arrive quickly. The road has lions. There are pitfalls. There is death, beware,” he said.

“...There is no short cut to being the leader of the people. Just as there was no short cut to our independence.”

ZANU-PF would move to discipline Mnangagwa’s “co-conspirators”, Mugabe added.

ZANU-PF’s executive politburo is expected to decide at a meeting on Wednesday whether to fire Mnangagwa and his allies from the party.

Mnangagwa has not been seen in public since his dismissal from government but his ally Mutsvangwa said he was “safe and beyond the reach of the assassins”.

Mutsvangwa ruled out trying to remove Mugabe by force and said war veterans, who had publicly backed Mnangagwa and broke ranks with the president last year, would form a broad front with the opposition in elections next year.

“We don’t want to abuse the military to resolve a political problem. We don’t want them to become the arbiter of political power,” Mutsvangwa said.

He was critical of Mugabe’s wife Grace, who looks set to become vice president after a special ZANU-PF congress in December. “This is a coup by marriage certificate ....and it will be resisted,” he said.",Zimbabwe's Mugabe: Beware of death on road to presidency,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-zimbabwe-politics/zimbabwes-mugabe-beware-of-death-on-road-to-presidency-idUKKBN1D825B?il=0

O executivo não mencionou durante teleconferência com analistas e jornalistas que valor a margem de lucro antes de juros, impostos, depreciação e amortização (Ebitda) poderá atingir nos próximos trimestres, mas citou ações da empresa para reduzir custos. Entre as ações estão projetos para digitalização.

“Tem bastante espaço para continuar crescendo (a margem). Este ano vamos gastar cerca de 700 milhões de reais em gestão de base, com uma digitalização completa esse custo seria quase que zerado”, disse Angelis, referindo-se a atividades de cobrança de clientes por exemplo.

“Temos projetos para que este valor possa se reduzir no médio prazo de forma expressiva e isso vai virar ganho puro de vários pontos percentuais no Ebitda”, acrescentou.

Segundo o executivo, além das ações em gestão de base, a empresa deverá gastar este ano 600 milhões de reais em comissão para vendedores de recarga de clientes. “Pagamos 7 por cento aos distribuidores e com canais digitais isso poderia ser reduzido”, afirmou Angelis.

No período de julho a setembro deste ano, a margem Ebitda da TIM cresceu pelo 16º trimestre consecutivo.

As ações da TIM estavam entre os principais destaques de alta do Ibovespa .BVSP nesta quarta-feira, exibindo às 11:53 valorização de 3,2 por cento.

Angelis afirmou que a empresa vai pagar ainda em novembro 190 milhões de reais em juros sobre capital próprio e que o valor, não previsto no orçamento da empresa, representa um “aquecimento” sobre as próximas distribuições aos acionistas depois que a empresa conseguiu reverter este ano um fluxo de caixa líquido negativo registrado no ano passado.

Questionado sobre o quanto do crescimento da empresa deve-se à fraqueza da rival em recuperação judicial Oi (OIBR3.SA), Angelis comentou que a Oi não tem investido em 4G e nos segmentos de mais alto valor do mercado e que isso é uma oportunidade para a TIM, que está buscando ampliar sua cobertura de banda larga móvel no país e também de fibra óptica.

“Temos hoje uma oportunidade no segmento de pós-pago e no segmento de alto valor, por outro lado a Oi está tendo estratégia bastante agressiva em serviços tradicionais e nas regiões mais fortes deles como Nordeste, onde estão aumentando participação de mercado”, disse Angelis.

Federer will kick off the tournament, which has been held in London’s 02 Arena since 2009, against Sock on Sunday with Zverev facing Cilic in the later session.

Nadal will start on Monday against Goffin, giving him an extra day to test the knee which forced him to withdraw from the Paris Masters.

Zverev, 20, has taken men’s tennis by storm this year, rocketing up to number three in the world rankings after winning five titles, including two Masters 1000 events.

“It’s an honor to play there in London, it’s my first time and hopefully not my last,” Zverev said in Milan where he took part in an exhibition match at the Next Gen Finals, having dropped out to concentrate on London.

“I will try to prepare myself as well as I can and try to win many matches there.”

He is one of three first-timers with Dimitrov finally qualifying after being long-predicted to become a regular member of the men’s elite. Sock is the first American to qualify since Mardy Fish did so in 2011.

Goffin has qualified for the first time also, although last year he played a match as an alternate.

The draw, which took place on BBC Radio, was delayed because Boris Becker, who Nadal’s group is named after, was held up by traffic on his way to the studio.

And in this case, it’s working hard to stay on regulators’ good side.

Uber said it was the first formal services contract by the U.S. National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) covering low-altitude airspace rather than outer space. NASA has used such contracts to develop rockets since the late 1950s.

Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden also said Uber would begin testing four-passenger, 200-miles-per-hour (322-km-per-hour) flying taxi services across Los Angeles in 2020, its second test market after Dallas/Fort Worth.

Holden is set to reveal the company’s latest air taxi plans at Web Summit, an annual internet conference taking place in Lisbon this week.

“There is a reality that Uber has grown up a lot as a company,” Holden said in an interview ahead of his speech. “We are now a major company on the world stage and you can’t do things the same way where you are a large-scale, global company that you can do when you are a small, scrappy startup.”

Uber has faced endless regulatory and legal battles around the world since it launched its ride-hailing services earlier this decade, including a recent showdown in London, where it is battling to retain its license after having been stripped of it by city regulators over safety concerns. [nL8N1MO228]

The company is looking to speed development of a new industry of electric, on-demand, urban air taxis, Holden said, which customers could order up via smartphone in ways that parallel the ground-based taxi alternatives it has popularized while expanding into more than 600 cites since 2011.

The company plans to introduce paid, intra-city flying taxi services from 2023 and is working closely with aviation regulators in the United States and Europe to win regulatory approvals toward that end, a senior Uber executive told Reuters.

“We are very much embracing the regulatory bodies and starting very early in discussions about this and getting everyone aligned with the vision,” he said of Uber’s plans to introduce what he called “ride-sharing in the sky”.

Earlier this year, Uber hired NASA veterans Mark Moore and Tom Prevot to run, respectively, its aircraft vehicle design team and its air traffic management software program.

During a 32-year career at NASA, Moore pioneered its electric jet propulsion project which Uber considers to be the core technology for making urban air transportation possible.

MAKING TAXIS FLY

The contract with NASA is to solve the problem of operating hundreds or thousands of aircraft over urban areas with the goal of enabling uberAIR services to operate alongside existing air traffic control systems and in and around busy airports.

NASA was not immediately available to comment on the deal. Earlier this month it said it was working with a variety of companies, large and small, to develop the emerging market for what it terms Urban Air Mobility, or UAM.

Uber envisions a fleet of electric jet-powered vehicles - part helicopter, part drone and part fixed-wing aircraft - running multiple small rotors capable of both vertical take off and landing and rapid horizontal flight.

Two larger rotors used to lift the plane transition during flight into forward-thrusting propellers in newly released designs.

It plans to build no aircraft itself.

Instead, Uber is building the software to manage networks in the sky of flying taxis, while relying on a stable of manufacturers, including Aurora Flight Sciences, which was acquired by Boeing (BA.N) last month.

Uber has also signed up Embraer (EMBR3.SA), Mooney, Bell Helicopter - a unit of Textron (TXT.N) -, and Pipistrel Aircraft to build new vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.

It is also working with real estate developers Sandstone Properties in Los Angeles to build rooftop landing pads on skyscrapers from which it aims to offer its uberAIR services. It plans to start offering services from locations near a downtown sports arena, the international airport, Santa Monica and Sherman Oaks in suburban San Fernando Valley, the company said.",NASA contracts Uber to build flying taxi air control software,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-portugal-websummit-uber/nasa-contracts-uber-to-build-flying-taxi-air-control-software-idUKKBN1D81AI

A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.

Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.

“It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.

Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.

Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago.

The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources.

Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported.

Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips.

Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.

The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets.

Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.

Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS

Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc (BRCD.O) while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP. Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.

Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.

Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones.

Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device.

Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.

Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said.

Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney.

Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights.

“These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal.

Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues.

Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.",Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-plans-record-tech-deal-with-qualcomm-bid-sources-idUSKBN1D324K

As his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has handed the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed more and more power over the past three years, the ambitious young leader has taken on everything from economic reforms to waging war in neighbouring Yemen. Here is what you need to know.

ROYAL POLITICS

Prince Mohammed capped his rapid rise to power in June this year by replacing his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, widely known as MbN, as crown prince.

A source close to King Salman said MbN’s dismissal was “in the higher interests of the state” because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction, a legacy of an assassination attempt that left shrapnel in his body.

Reuters could not independently confirm MbN’s addiction issues.

ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN

Prince Mohammed tightened his grip on power with the start of the anti-corruption campaign at the weekend, purging the kingdom’s political and business elite. Among those arrested were 11 princes.

Many Saudis welcomed the moves as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds by the powerful. U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years” but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

YEMEN

Prince Mohammed launched a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen in March 2015. A Saudi-led coalition, acting on an invitation from the internationally-recognised government, has targeted the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people.

The war is closely identified with the prince in his role as defence minister. His image once adorned war propaganda but is rarely associated with the war now, although he has said it must continue in order to quash Iranian influence.

Even before the conflict, Yemen was the poorest country on the Arabian peninsula and now millions of people there are facing famine and a cholera epidemic. The coalition denies it blocks commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel.

QATAR

Prince Mohammed has helped lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Qatar, saying Riyadh’s erstwhile ally backs terrorism and cosies up to Iran. Qatar rejects the accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbours’ backing for authoritarian rulers.

The campaign has divided Gulf Arab countries, who Washington regards as essential to its influence in the region. Qatar had incensed Riyadh by cheering Arab Spring uprisings against some autocratic Arab rulers.

CONFRONTATION WITH IRAN

Saudi Arabia’s rivalry with Iran, its competitor for influence in the Middle East, has deepened as King Salman and Prince Mohammed worked to build a Sunni coalition against Tehran and its allies in the Arab world.

In May, as deputy crown prince, Prince Mohammed used unusually provocative language to rule out dialogue with revolutionary Shi‘ite Muslim theocracy Iran, which he said was trying to interfere in Arab lands and dominate the Muslim world.

On Tuesday, state media quoted him as describing Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen as “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Prince Mohammed has also opened a new front in the proxy war with Iran by threatening Tehran’s ally Hezbollah and its home country Lebanon. The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh, was widely seen as the first act on this new front.

The crown prince has also sought the help of Shi‘ite leaders in Iraq to try to reverse Iran’s dominant role there and shore up security on the kingdom’s northern border, and has tried to improve ties with the United States under Trump, who shares his and King Salman’s antipathy to Iran’s government.

The planned sale of about 5 percent of national oil company Saudi Aramco next year is a centrepiece of Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s blueprint to move the economy away from what he called its “addiction to oil” towards the private sector.

The IPO is expected to raise as much as $100 billion (76 billion pounds) but investors wonder whether Aramco can be valued anywhere close to the $2 trillion figure announced by the crown prince and there has been market speculation that the IPO could be delayed beyond 2018 or shelved. He recently stated it would happen next year.

Many Saudis have misgivings about the sale, with some fearing Riyadh is selling cheaply at a time of low oil prices.

ECONOMIC REFORMS

Vision 2030 has begun to reduce a big state budget deficit with austerity measures but has not yet created major new sources of non-oil growth or jobs.

The phased removal of subsidies on fuel, water and electricity has started but some austerity moves have been unpopular. Already, some have been reversed or delayed as the economy has slowed because of low oil prices.

The plan includes private investment and privatisations and building the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The aim is to create jobs and raise the participation of women in the workforce from 22 percent now to 30 percent by 2030.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Saudi Arabia adheres to an austere Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas.

Prince Mohammed’s ascent represents a social and cultural sea change, with power set to be passed to a much younger generation seemingly more in tune with young Saudis. In moves that reinforce that perception, women will be permitted to drive from next year and allowed to attend sports events.

The crown prince has also said the country will move to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam, and reforms have begun in areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy such as education, courts and the law. Saudi authorities have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date Islam.

NEOM

Last month Prince Mohammed announced a $500-billion plan to create a business and industrial zone extending across its borders into Jordan and Egypt, part of his efforts to reduce dependence on oil.

The 26,500 square-km (10,230 square-mile) zone, known as NEOM, will focus on industries including energy and water, biotechnology, food, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, and will power itself solely with wind power and solar energy.

The crown prince says the government, Public Investment Fund and local and international investors are expected to sink billions into the zone in coming years. The crown prince told Reuters NEOM would be floated on financial markets alongside Aramco.",Shifting sands: What is changing in Saudi Arabia?,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arrests-milestones/reform-and-royal-rivalry-milestones-in-saudi-crown-princes-ascent-idUKKBN1D819B

First, he committed to addressing the shortcomings of the Iran nuclear deal, without terminating it. Second, he called for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. More sanctions, however, will not be enough to accomplish either of these goals.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, at a news conference in Tehran, May 22, 2017. TIMA via REUTERS

The president’s twin objectives of fixing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the nuclear deal is known, and confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional behavior are closely connected. Barack Obama overlooked Tehran’s military expansion into Iraq and Syria, among other actions, for the purpose of winning Iranian cooperation on the nuclear issue. The result was not just a disastrous deal, but a diminished U.S. ability to accomplish any of its strategic objectives in the region.

To defend our vital interests in the Middle East and potentially improve a deeply flawed nuclear deal, the United States must first rebuild leverage by countering Tehran’s growing aggression and influence in the region. That cannot be accomplished overnight. Nor can it be done solely through the use of sanctions or the threat of withdrawal from the agreement.

Along with more sanctions, and before trying to fix or abandon the deal, policymakers must develop a comprehensive strategy, utilizing every element of American power, to rebuild and apply counter-pressure against the full spectrum of Iran’s destabilizing behaviors.The Gemunder Center Iran Task Force at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, recently detailed such a strategy, consisting of two elements.

U.S. President Donald Trump discusses the Iran nuclear deal in the White House, October 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

First, restore credible U.S. military leverage against Iran. American officials should prepare – and make clear they are preparing – contingency plans to defend the United States and its allies from Iranian nuclear-capable missiles. The United States should be prepared to shoot down Iranian nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, including test launches, and respond forcefully to any Iranian harassment of U.S. naval vessels. To this end, it should deploy the Aegis missile defense system to the Persian Gulf (like we already do in Europe and East Asia).

It is also critical that the United States has a post-Islamic State strategy for Syria, including more assistance to our allies on the ground in holding territory hard-won from IS. This is necessary to prevent Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies from dictating that country’s future and consolidating a land bridge from Iran to Lebanon.

Second, Washington must take the lead in assembling a coherent regional coalition against Iran. This will require more concerted cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop robust missile defenses against Iran’s region-wide proliferation of advanced missiles.

The Trump administration and Congress must also augment the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on defense aid to Israel by removing Obama-era caps on missile defense assistance. The MoU must be treated as the floor, not the ceiling, for bilateral cooperation against Iran’s and Hezbollah’s growing presence and capabilities on Israel’s northern borders. Similarly, we must ensure U.S. and Gulf air and maritime defenses can operate in close coordination as Iran’s military capabilities expand under the nuclear deal.

Trump is absolutely right to call the JCPOA “unacceptable” in its current form. By allowing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and conventional arms purchases to expire over the next 15 years, the JCPOA actively grants Iran the right to become a de facto ICBM-armed, militarily modernized nuclear power.

Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer -

Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha’s fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Traders worried that Riyadh’s allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding “radical ideology”. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.

Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.

The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. “Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,” it said.

More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.

Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.

However, Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.

Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.

EXCLUSION ZONES

With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.

Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE’s port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.

A map of Qatar is seen in this picture illustration June 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration

Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world’s most important ports for the global energy market.

Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.

The UAE’s ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.

“This shouldn’t affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It’s a minor inconvenience,” one LNG trader said.

LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.

Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country’s Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.

Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.

Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.

“The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,” a trading source said.

The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.",Port bans choke Qatar's commodity trade as gas supply worries grow,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-commodities/port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-idUSKBN18X1Y2

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday Moscow opposed a draft U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of the investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Ryabkov’s comments came hours after Russia rejected a report by the international inquiry blaming the Syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack on April 4.

In a joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the United States, the four countries said they had full confidence in the findings and called on the Syrian regime to end all use of poison gas and finally declare to the OPCW all the chemical weapons it possesses.

“We therefore urge the United Nations Security Council to maintain the investigative capacity” of the inquiry, the statement said.

“After such a report, the Security Council and all its members have a common responsibility to protect the international non-proliferation regime and to respect their previous commitments,” the joint statement said.

The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The April 4 attack prompted a U.S. missile strike just days later against a Syrian air base. France has warned that any further chemicals attacks would be met with a military response.

Russia, a key backer of the Syrian government, last month cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council against renewing the investigation’s mandate.

The inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons and comply with the OPCW in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States, after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in the Damascus suburbs. Western countries blamed that attack on the Syrian government, which denied it.","In message to Russia, Western powers demand U.N. extend Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicals/in-message-to-russia-western-powers-demand-u-n-extend-syria-toxic-gas-inquiry-idUKKBN1D820C

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Five months into Trump’s presidency, the survey spanning 37 nations showed U.S. favorability ratings in the rest of the world slumping to 49 percent from 64 percent at the end of Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House.

But the falls were far steeper in some of America’s closest allies, including U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada, and European partners like Germany and Spain.

Trump took office in January pledging to put “America First”. Since then he has pressed ahead with plans to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, announced he will pull out of the Paris climate accord, and accused countries including Canada, Germany and China of unfair trade practices.

On his first foreign trip as president in early June, Trump received warm welcomes in Saudi Arabia and Israel, but a cool reception from European partners, with whom he clashed over NATO spending, climate and trade.

Just 30 percent of Mexicans now say they have a favorable view of the United States, down from 66 percent at the end of the Obama era. In Canada and Germany, favorability ratings slid by 22 points, to 43 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

In many European countries, the ratings were comparable to those seen at the end of the presidency of George W. Bush, whose 2003 invasion of Iraq was deeply unpopular.

“The drop in favorability ratings for the United States is widespread,” the Pew report said. “The share of the public with a positive view of the U.S. has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from Latin America, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa”.

Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, with confidence ratings of 27 percent and 28 percent respectively, scored higher than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with a confidence rating of 42 percent, scored highest among the four leaders in the survey.

The countries with the lowest confidence in Trump were Mexico, at 5 percent and Spain at 7 percent. The only two countries where ratings improved compared to Obama were Russia, where confidence in the U.S. president surged to 53 percent from 11 percent, and Israel, where it rose 7 points to 56 percent.

Globally, 75 percent of respondents described Trump as “arrogant”, 65 percent as “intolerant” and 62 percent as “dangerous”. A majority of 55 percent also described him as a “strong leader”.

The Swiss 19-time grand slam champion had encouraging words for his friend and rival while helping Murray start his comeback gently by playing him in a charity match in Glasgow on Tuesday.

Former world number one Murray, who has been sidelined with a hip injury since Wimbledon, is targeting a return in the New Year with a view to competing at the Australian Open.

Federer, who was in a similar position last year when he missed the second half of the season through injury, took time out to completely recover and was rewarded with a spectacular return in 2017 featuring two grand slam triumphs.

Before beating Murray in the knockabout exhibition match, Federer told the three-time grand slam winner: ”My best advice is just to get fit again. Take your time, however long it takes.

”When you come back you want to be at 100 percent, otherwise the problem is you feel you just can’t beat the best at the big tournaments, so it’s wise and worthwhile to take the extra week, extra month maybe.

“I‘m sure Andy has a lot of years left so there shouldn’t be a hurry but as a professional athlete, you always want to come back as quickly as possible and you need to have goals but sometimes they need to be postponed.”

It is extraordinary how the pair’s fortunes have changed in 12 months, but the experience of 36-year-old Federer can act as an inspiration to a player six years his junior.

Yet the Swiss returned to win the Australian Open and Wimbledon, shoot back up to number two in the world and play some of the best tennis of his garlanded career while injury-hit Murray’s form and confidence dipped.

A figura de May, que aparece saindo da residência oficial no número 10 de Downing Street vestindo um terno vermelho e sapatos de pele de leopardo com saltinho, foi revelada pelo Madame Tussauds, museu que é uma das maiores atrações turísticas de Londres.

A verdadeira May, enquanto isso, sofre com diversas crises simultâneas, vários ministros de seu gabinete envolvidos em escândalos, uma guerra aberta em seu partido a respeito de como concretizar a separação britânica da União Europeia e um debate persistente sobre sua capacidade de exercer o cargo.

“Embora suas políticas possam ser questionadas, garantimos que nossa figura de cera da primeira-ministra certamente é forte e estável”, disse Edward Fuller, gerente-geral do Madame Tussauds, fazendo graça com o slogan de campanha de uma eleição que se voltou contra May.

Apresentando-se como o pilar de “uma liderança forte e estável”, May convocou uma eleição antecipada em junho esperando vencer com folga, mas sua campanha não conseguiu inspirar o eleitorado e, ao invés disso, ela perdeu sua maioria parlamentar.

Desde então seu governo dividido vem se arrastando de uma crise para outra, e a humilhação da premiê culminou em um discurso feito em uma conferência partidária durante o qual um humorista lhe entregou uma carta de demissão de mentira e letras de um slogan às suas costas se soltaram.

Nada desta sensação de caos e desorientação fez parte da cena apresentada pelo Madame Tussauds, que mostra uma May sorridente segurando uma pasta negra e saindo pela famosa porta negra de Downing Street.

O terno vermelho da figura de cera é o mesmo que ela usou em uma visita à Casa Branca durante a qual May e o presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, seguraram as mãos – uma das imagens mais amplamente divulgadas de seu mandato como premiê.

A verdadeira May também o vestiu na noite da votação de junho, uma ocasião infeliz na qual subiu a um palco para comemorar a vitória em seu reduto eleitoral ao mesmo tempo em que o fracasso em escala nacional se tornava claro.

China Literature, the online publishing arm of mainland tech colossus Tencent, smashed the chandeliers in its $1.1 billion Hong Kong debut, soaring more than 80 percent in early trade on Wednesday. As local punters swarm into mainland tech, the new-issue market is starting to mimic distortions more common in Shanghai and Shenzhen. For the bourse operator, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, it’s a good problem to have.

The special administrative region had struggled for years to attract sexier companies to its bourse, dominated by staid blue-chips from finance and real estate. It also had a problem with IPO performance, with overpriced deals helped over the line by friendly “cornerstone” investors.

The recent run of successful tech listings, including online insurer Zhong An, selfie-app maker Meitu, and now China Literature, suggests such problems are being put behind - in exchange for new headaches. As Hong Kong opens up its bourse to investors from the People’s Republic, the exchange has started to show hints of mainland trading behaviour, with the volatility that entails.

China Literature’s big debut was thanks largely to retail enthusiasm. Local speculators bid for 625 times the shares on offer, tying up $67 billion in the process. In China, where individual investors dominate transactions, big first-day pops are routine. IPOs are usually thousands of times oversubscribed and they used to tie up so much cash they pushed up short-term interest rates, before regulators tweaked the rules.

That is because so much value is transferred to new investors. Every Chinese company that wants its IPO approved prices at 23 times price-to-earnings, the semi-official guidance rate, which effectively bakes in a big first-day pop. In the case of China Literature, Wednesday’s explosive rise suggests bankers may have left around $1 billion on the table.

Advisers may have sincerely underestimated demand for a company that makes money hosting amateur fiction about kung fu, time travel, and the “Nine Netherworld Bird”. Alternatively, enthusiasm may wear off quickly. Either way, volatility is good for a stock exchange, and as HKEX tries to reposition itself, a big launch for a mainland startup is something to celebrate.",Breakingviews - Hong Kong's IPO market is turning Chinese,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-literature-ipo-breakingviews/breakingviews-hong-kongs-ipo-market-is-turning-chinese-idUSKBN1D80D4

Deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four ex-ministers from his regional government arrived in Belgium last week, saying they had fled arrest in order to campaign in Brussels, capital of the European Union, against Spanish sanctions on them for running an independence referendum.

Riven by its own regional division between Dutch- and French-speakers, Belgium has found itself a reluctant host to the Catalans.

“The most important message, which is my strong conviction, is dialogue, dialogue, political dialogue,” Prime Minister Charles Michel told lawmakers who grilled him on his coalition’s stance.

Michel, a French-speaking liberal, has irritated Madrid by being one of the few EU leaders to criticise police violence during last month’s referendum. But he has also sought to curb statements supporting the Catalan case from Flemish nationalist party N-VA, a major partner in his own coalition.

“There is a political crisis in Spain, but not in Belgium,” insisted Michel, as opposition lawmakers questioned him about divisions within the government on the Catalan issue.

His migration minister, from the N-VA, suggested before Puigdemont fled Barcelona that the Catalan leader could be entitled to political asylum in Belgium.

Michel at the time called on the minister not to pour “oil on the fire”. He then said Puigdemont could stay in Belgium for now just like “any other European citizen”, but stressed that he had not been invited by the Belgian authorities.

On Wednesday, echoing that cool tone, he said the Belgian government would not interfere in the judicial process under which Belgian judges must now rule on a request from Spain to extradite the five politicians.

Nor, Michel said, would it play a role in any asylum claim.

Puigdemont has raised objections to going back to Spain - where he faces charges of rebellion that could carry a jail term of up to 30 years - but has not sought refugee status, something that Belgian legal experts say he and the others would be unlikely to obtain.","Caught up in Catalan crisis, Belgian PM urges 'dialogue'",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-catalonia-belgium/caught-up-in-catalan-crisis-belgian-pm-urges-dialogue-idUKKBN1D81NS?il=0

Addressing supporters at the headquarters of his ZANU-PF party in Harare, 93-year-old Mugabe accused Emmerson Mnangagwa of consulting witchdoctors and prophets as part of a campaign to secure the presidency.

Mnangagwa said he had fled Zimbabwe because of death threats and was safe.

“My sudden departure was caused by incessant threats on my person, life and family by those who have attempted before through various forms of elimination including poisoning,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.

The head of the influential war veterans association, Chris Mutsvangwa, said that Mnangagwa, who was sacked on Monday, would travel to Johannesburg in neighboring South Africa “very soon”.

Mugabe said Mnangagwa, nicknamed “Crocodile”, had made the same mistakes as Joice Mujuru, who was the president’s deputy for 10 years until she was fired in 2014.

“You should not try to say because the journey is long, then I should take a short cut to arrive quickly. The road has lions. There are pitfalls. There is death, beware,” he said.

“...There is no short cut to being the leader of the people. Just as there was no short cut to our independence.”

ZANU-PF would move to discipline Mnangagwa’s “co-conspirators”, Mugabe added.

ZANU-PF’s executive politburo is expected to decide at a meeting on Wednesday whether to fire Mnangagwa and his allies from the party.

Mnangagwa has not been seen in public since his dismissal from government but his ally Mutsvangwa said he was “safe and beyond the reach of the assassins”.

Mutsvangwa ruled out trying to remove Mugabe by force and said war veterans, who had publicly backed Mnangagwa and broke ranks with the president last year, would form a broad front with the opposition in elections next year.

“We don’t want to abuse the military to resolve a political problem. We don’t want them to become the arbiter of political power,” Mutsvangwa said.

He was critical of Mugabe’s wife Grace, who looks set to become vice president after a special ZANU-PF congress in December. “This is a coup by marriage certificate ....and it will be resisted,” he said.",Zimbabwe's Mugabe: Beware of death on road to presidency,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-zimbabwe-politics/zimbabwes-mugabe-beware-of-death-on-road-to-presidency-idUKKBN1D825B

On Sunday, Congo’s CENI elections commission announced that the election, which term limits currently bar Kabila from taking part in, will be held on Dec. 23, 2018 with the winner to be sworn in on Jan. 13, 2019.

“The calendar presented by the CENI violates the Constitution, the Dec. 31, 2016 accord and electoral law,” read a statement from opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi’s Rassemblement coalition.

The document was also agreed to by the MLC and UNC opposition parties.

Dozens died in protests against Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December.

Unrest sparked by the uncertainty surrounding the polls has raised fears Congo could witness a repeat of the kind of violence that killed millions around the turn of the last century, mostly from hunger and disease.

After the CENI said last month that the vote could only take place in April 2019 at the earliest, the opposition warned that the population would “take matters into its own hands”.

“The opposition leaders call upon all the Congolese people to be vigilant and mobilized in the aim of freeing up the electoral process by Dec. 31, 2017,” Tuesday’s Rassemblement statement said.

It nonetheless went on to state that the coalition believed it was possible to hold the vote by June 30 next year at the latest.

No more.

In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain’s decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come.

Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero.

That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.

There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term.

But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.

That is the first time in Reuters’ historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound’s exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.

With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.

This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound.

On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU.

On Wednesday, the central bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.

Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.

Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.

“Risk reversals tend to price fear,” said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.

“It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people’s minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.”

At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.

Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.

“The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,” said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.

“That is a change.”","Forget euro zone breakup, sterling now deemed riskier",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-sterling-options-analysis/forget-euro-zone-breakup-sterling-now-deemed-riskier-idUSKBN19E0WV

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do. Two people briefed on the talks told Reuters the government has sought as long as 10 years for such conditions while AT&T has pressed for a shorter period.",AT&T says timing of Time Warner deal completion now uncertain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a/att-says-timing-of-time-warner-deal-completion-now-uncertain-idUKKBN1D81Z8

The Venice, California-based firm, whose March stock market debut was the hottest of any tech stock in years, reported revenue and user growth for the third quarter well below Wall Street expectations as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Instagram.

Snap’s shares tumbled as much as 20 percent in after-hours trading, before paring losses to trade at $12.57. Snap went public at a price of $17 a share.

Snap has disappointed investors each quarter of its brief existence as a public company.

User growth in the last three months was well below what investment analysts expected. Daily active users rose to 178 million in the third quarter from 173 million in the second quarter. Analysts had expected 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said the company was launching the redesign after hearing for years that Snapchat was difficult to understand or hard to use.

“We are going to make it easier to discover the vast quantity of content on our platform that goes undiscovered or unseen every day,” Spiegel told analysts on a conference call.

The 27-year-old CEO said there was a “strong likelihood” the redesign would be disruptive in the short term, but said Snap was willing to take the risk for long-term gain.

Such a radical change so soon after an IPO is unusual.

Snap is not the only social media company looking to revive growth by changing its look. Microblogging service Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Tuesday it would roll out 280-character tweets to users across the world, double the length of its iconic 140-character tweets.

Asked on the analyst call what Snapchat’s redesign would look like, Spiegel said the company had been studying the evolution of mobile content feeds such as Twitter streams and the Facebook News Feed and saw room for a “personalized content service.”

Spiegel said the company next year would also build more tools for people to share with broad audiences beyond their friends, the type of public broadcasting common on Instagram and Twitter.

“It seems like a significant amount of change in a short period of time,” analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG told Spiegel on the call. He asked what led to the shifts.

Spiegel said Snap needed to evolve rapidly. “We’re just not afraid to make changes in the long-term interest of the business,” he said.

REVENUE MISS

Snaps’s third-quarter revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertisements, rose to $207.9 million from $128.2 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $236.9 million.

Average revenue per user rose to $1.17 in the quarter, from 84 cents a year earlier, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.30.

Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said revenue was affected by a shift toward a software-based auction system for selling ads - a method employed by Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google - which has driven down the average price.

The auction system hit revenue in the short term but “builds the foundation for long-term scalable revenue,” Khan said in written remarks. He said Snap more than tripled revenue from small- and medium-sized businesses in the third quarter compared with the first half of the year.

Snap is far behind Facebook and Google in making its ad system accessible to small businesses and should move faster, said Greg Portell, a consultant at A.T. Kearney.

“I think they spent a little too much time being different,” Portell said.

Snap recorded a $39.9 million charge in the quarter related to excess inventory of its “Spectacles,” sunglasses with a built-in camera.

INVESTORS SOUR

Snap posted a net loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with a loss of $124.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.

Wall Street had expected a loss of 32 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Snapchat, popular among millennials for the bunny faces and floral tiaras that can be added to pictures, allows users to chat through a series of disappearing photos and videos. Users can also post images and videos as “stories” - ephemeral posts that can be viewed in chronological order and disappear after 24 hours.

Before the quarterly release, Snap’s share price was already down 39 percent from its close on March 2, its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook’s shares were up 32 percent over that time.

Facebook’s Instagram said in September that it had 500 million daily active users.

A local resident with a rifle fired at the suspect as he left the church. The gunman dropped his Ruger assault weapon and fled in his vehicle, said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety. A man told San Antonio television station KSAT he was driving near the church when the resident who had opened fire on the gunman approached his truck and urged him to give chase.

He added they reached speeds of 95 miles per hour during the chase, while he was on the phone with emergency dispatchers. Soon afterward, the suspect crashed the vehicle near the border of a neighbouring county and was found dead inside with a cache of weapons. It was not immediately clear if he killed himself or was hit when the resident fired at him outside the church, authorities said. The suspect's identity was not disclosed by authorities, but law enforcement officials who asked not to be named said he was Devin Patrick Kelley, described as a white, 26-year-old man, the New York Times and other media reported.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday Moscow opposed a draft U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of the investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Ryabkov’s comments came hours after Russia rejected a report by the international inquiry blaming the Syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack on April 4.

In a joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the United States, the four countries said they had full confidence in the findings and called on the Syrian regime to end all use of poison gas and finally declare to the OPCW all the chemical weapons it possesses.

“We therefore urge the United Nations Security Council to maintain the investigative capacity” of the inquiry, the statement said.

“After such a report, the Security Council and all its members have a common responsibility to protect the international non-proliferation regime and to respect their previous commitments,” the joint statement said.

The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The April 4 attack prompted a U.S. missile strike just days later against a Syrian air base. France has warned that any further chemicals attacks would be met with a military response.

Russia, a key backer of the Syrian government, last month cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council against renewing the investigation’s mandate.

The inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons and comply with the OPCW in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States, after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in the Damascus suburbs. Western countries blamed that attack on the Syrian government, which denied it.","In message to Russia, Western powers demand U.N. extend Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicals/in-message-to-russia-western-powers-demand-u-n-extend-syria-toxic-gas-inquiry-idUSKBN1D820E?il=0

China claims almost the entire strategic waterway where $3 trillion worth of sea-borne goods passes every year, building and militarizing artificial islands. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims.

“So, it’s about time, either in the bilateral or in the plenary, I should be bringing this important matter to the surface,” Duterte told reporters before leaving for Vietnam.

He said China had to make it clear to Southeast Asian countries its intentions in the South China Sea. “You want to control the passage or do we have the free passage?” he said, adding he would not be confrontational.

Since coming to office 16 months ago, the firebrand leader has been conciliatory to Beijing, despite a ruling from an international arbitration court favoring the Philippines in its territorial dispute with China.

In the past, Duterte has repeatedly said he will raise the sea dispute at the proper time and avoided the issue when Manila hosted two regional meetings this year.

The two countries will also negotiate a military protocol to avoid maritime “miscalculations”, Manila’s defense minister said on Wednesday following a brief standoff near a Philippine-occupied island in a disputed part of the South China Sea.

Delfin Lorenzana said the Philippines tried to put up makeshift structures on a sand bar about 4 km (2.5 miles) off Thitu island in the Spratly archipelago in August, but China objected and sent ships to the area.

Duterte sought to defuse tensions by ordering troops to pull out. Construction was stopped.

“We intend to sit down with China to draft and agree on a protocol to resolve immediately any incident,” he said, adding he hoped talks could start this year.

But the plan faces stiff opposition from nations with big automotive industries, with German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel warning on Tuesday that stricter emissions rules could cost growth and jobs.

The European Commission’s proposal aims to curb greenhouse gases from transport as part of a drive to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

The EU’s executive is keen for legislation to stimulate European industry to develop electric vehicles, afraid that it is falling behind China, Japan and the United States.

“The competition is here,” Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said, citing the use of Chinese electric cars by Brussels taxis firms. “The car was invented in Europe and I believe it should be reinvented here.”

The proposal calls for a 30 percent reduction in the average CO2 emission of carmakers’ fleets by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. It also sets an interim goal of a 15 percent reduction by 2025 to help ensure automakers start investments early.

If they are found in breach of new rules, carmakers face potential fines in the millions of euros, with penalties set at 95 euros for every gram of CO2 above the limit and for each new vehicle registered in that year.

Inspired by Californian climate policy, the draft bill would allow carmakers to offset their overall target if the share of zero and low-emission vehicles in their fleet surpasses a benchmark set by regulators.

The bar for low-emissions vehicles is set at 50 grams per kilometer - ruling out most hybrid vehicles.

European Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete holds a news conference on mobility and climate change package at the EC headquarters in Brussels, Belgium November 8, 2017. Reuters/Eric Vidal

Unlike California’s system - viewed by many in the sector as the leading laboratory for policy on electric cars - EU regulators shied away from quotas. There is also no penalty for failing to meet the zero-emission vehicle benchmark.

Heralding tough negotiations with member states and the European Parliament before the bill becomes law, companies called the proposals too ambitious, while environmental campaigners and consumer groups said they did not go far enough.

The European carmakers lobby ACEA said the 30 percent target was “overly challenging” and the 2025 interim target did not give the industry enough time to make changes.

“The current proposal is very aggressive when we consider the low and fragmented market penetration of alternatively-powered vehicles across Europe,” Erik Jonnaert, ACEA secretary general, said in a statement.

In a nod to manufacturers’ concerns, the Commission is set to earmark 800 million euros ($928 million) to support the rollout of charging points for electric vehicles and 200 million euros for battery development.

Outrage over Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) cheating of U.S. emissions tests has put pressure on EU regulators to tighten controls, with several European governments and cities announcing bans of combustion-engine cars in the next two decades.

“We want the European automotive industry get back in the race for global leadership on clean vehicles,” EU climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said its analysis showed a more ambitious CO2 target would foster the uptake of electrified vehicles.

“From a technical standpoint, more progress is definitely possible,” said Peter Mock, the ICCT’s EU managing director.

The Commission also set targets for public authorities to source a percentage of either low emission or zero emission vehicles in their public procurement by 2030, for example garbage trucks.","EU plans credits, fines to boost low-emission car production",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-autos-emissions/eu-plans-credits-fines-to-boost-low-emission-car-production-idUKKBN1D80ZM

The players arrested were freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, according to USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and ESPN, all of which cited unnamed sources familiar with the incident. Ball is the younger brother of National Basketball Association rookie Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Reached by telephone at a hotel in the eastern city of Hangzhou on Wednesday, Ball declined to comment. ESPN said the three had been picked up by police at their hotel on Tuesday and released on bail early on Wednesday. They were confined to their hotel pending legal proceedings, it said.

The University of California, Los Angeles, declined to confirm the arrests but said it was “aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China”.

“The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,” UCLA Athletics said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Shana Wilson.

The UCLA team had arrived in China on Sunday with plans to play Georgia Tech in both teams’ regular-season opener on Saturday, according to statements from both teams.

It traveled to Hangzhou, about three hours by bus from Shanghai, to visit the campus of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), sponsor of the annual Pac-12 games in China.

The three players were questioned about stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the hotel where the team is staying, ESPN said. UCLA representatives, including coach Steve Alford, were at the police station while they were there, it said, citing an unidentified source.

Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement the conference was “disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about.”

“Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation,” he said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday the Chinese government had reported the case to the U.S. side in accordance with consular agreements.

“China is handling this case in accordance with the law and will guarantee the lawful rights in accordance with the law of those involved in this case,” she said.

In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Arash Markazi, a senior writer at ESPN, LaVar Ball said his son, LiAngelo, would be fine.

“He’ll be fine. Everyone’s making it a big deal. It ain’t that big a deal,” said Ball, the outspoken CEO of athletic apparel maker Big Baller Brand.

Chinese President Xi Jinping led Trump on a private tour of the Forbidden City to kick off his visit on Wednesday.

White House officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Alibaba declined to comment, as did the Hangzhou police.

A U.S. State Department official said the department was aware of reports of three citizens arrested in China and stood ready to provide assistance but had no further comment due to privacy considerations.

Three players from Georgia Tech were questioned by the authorities in China on Tuesday at their hotel in Hangzhou but were later released by police, Georgia Tech athletics spokesman Mike Flynn said in a statement.

“During the questioning, it was determined that Georgia Tech student-athletes were not involved in the activities being investigated.

Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow while Bank of America weighed on the S&P. The S&P financial sector led the decliners, falling 0.7 percent.

Analysts said a flattening yield curve at a time when the Federal Reserve is hiking rates is a sign that investors are wary about the sustainability of economic growth and inflation in the world’s biggest economy.

Investors are also nervous about the potential outcome of a Republican plan to cut corporate taxes, unveiled last week. As well as slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the bill would eliminate many tax breaks and is expected to face opposition from interest groups.

Senate Republican leaders are considering a one-year delay in the implementation of a major corporate tax cut to comply with Senate rules, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources.

“I do expect the tax bill to be watered down,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.

“My concern is that the market has fully factored in that a tax bill is going to come to pass and this is still a very difficult road to get this done and there’s not a whole lot of time.”

Republicans are yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

The CBO, the nonpartisan budget-scoring agency, said in a statement on its website that eliminating the mandate in the Affordable Care Act, also often dubbed Obamacare, would lower the deficit by $338 billion over the next decade, not $416 billion, its previous estimate.

It will release a fuller revised analysis conducted with the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation later on Wednesday that will also estimate the impact on health insurance coverage and premiums.

As the House tax committee weighed amendments to a bill that Democrats have blasted as a give-away to corporations and the rich, the Washington tax reform debate was fast shifting to the Senate, where Republicans hold only a slim majority.

Senate Republicans are expected to unveil their own tax bill at the end of the week, and early indications suggest it could differ significantly from the House legislation.

The House is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior Republican said.

Tax reform has been a priority for President Donald Trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth. But Republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

Trump made another pitch for Democratic support on Capitol Hill, where his top aides met with about a dozen Senate Democrats and Trump himself phoned in from his Asia trip.

“He said, ‘Look … I want to do it in a bipartisan way,'” Senator Joe Donnelly told reporters.

Fitch Ratings predicted that a Republican tax plan would win passage in both chambers, but did not see it offering long-term benefits.

“Such reform would deliver a modest and temporary spur to growth. ... However, it will lead to wider fiscal deficits and add significantly to U.S. government debt,” Fitch said, revising up its medium-term U.S. government debt forecast.

The U.S. national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Republicans once firmly opposed adding to the debt, but their emphasis has changed. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) said the House bill would add nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt from 2018 through 2027.

Trump and congressional Republicans say the proposed tax cuts would boost economic growth enough to generate new revenues that would offset the tax cuts. Few economists agree.

The House bill slashes tax rates for large corporations, small businesses and wealthy Americans, while sharply reducing or eliminating tax breaks that benefit many middle-class Americans such as deductions for state and local taxes, college tuition and home mortgage interest.

JCT estimates that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023.

House Republicans, who have an overwhelming majority, drafted their bill in secret, ignoring Democrats.

But the House bill is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 seat majority and they need to pay heed to moderates within their own ranks as well as Democrats, lobbyists and analysts said.

Two conservative Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have already voiced concern that the House tax bill could raise taxes on some middle-class Americans.

The Senate bill could delay the proposed corporate tax cut by one year, may not allow any deductions for local property taxes, and may not collapse the current seven individual brackets to the four proposed by the House, according to the Washington Post.

PRESSURE TO DELIVER

Republican leaders have pushed for the House to vote on the tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23.

“My donors are basically saying, get it done or don’t ever call me again,” Republican Representative Chris Collins said.

U.S. tax legislation must begin in the House. “We’ll bring it to the floor next week,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News.

In party-line votes on Tuesday, Brady’s tax committee voted down eight Democratic amendments that would have preserved or expanded tax breaks for the middle class, nullified the tax legislation if it increased the deficit in future years and maintained taxes on foreign profits of U.S. corporations.

Brady offered a sweeping amendment on Monday that tweaked at least half a dozen provisions of the 425-page bill.

One related to carried interest income, a share of an investment fund’s profits paid out to the fund’s general partners and which represents a large portion of many fund managers’ incomes. Carried interest currently is taxed at the capital gains rate, which is substantially lower than the personal income tax rate for higher earners. Brady’s amendment would lengthen to more than three years from one the time period assets must be held in order to be eligible for the capital gains tax rate.

The amendment would also reduce the amount of carried-interest income eligible for the lower rate.",Republican tax plans gain speed; Fitch warns on deficit,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/republican-tax-plans-gain-speed-fitch-warns-on-deficit-idUSKBN1D72IN

Repairing the damage wrought on the broadband system, including replacing steel-braid wires that the pesky parrots have gnawed, has already cost A$80,000 ($61,500), network builder NBN Co said on Friday.

The company estimates the bill could rise sharply as more damage is uncovered and more cables are rolled out in the national telecommunications infrastructure project, which is not due to be completed until around 2021.

“They are constantly sharpening their beaks and as a result will attack and tear apart anything they come across,” said NBN Co project manager Chedryian Bresland in a blog post on the company’s website on Friday.

“Unfortunately, they’ve developed a liking to our cables ... these birds are unstoppable when in a swarm.”

Yellow-crested cockatoos are prolific in Australia and well-known for their voracious appetites for everything from fruit crops to wooden window frames.

Much of the cable chomping has occurred in grain-growing regions in Australia’s southeast.

“It would have to be an acquired taste, because it’s not their usual style,” Gisela Kaplan, a professor in animal behavior at the University of New England, told Reuters.

“Cockatoos usually go for wood, or strip the bark off trees, They don’t usually go for cables. But it might be the color or the position of the cables that’s attracted them,” she said.

PRESSURE FROM EMBASSIESSome foreign diplomats in Islamabad have long-held suspicions that North Korean diplomats in Pakistan are involved in bootlegging.
Pakistan denies being lax in policing such behaviour by North Korean diplomats.","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Neighbours say when three men kicked down the doors and burgled the home of a North Korean diplomat in Islamabad last month, it took them more than three hours to lug out their booty: thousands of bottles of Scotch whisky, beer and French wine.

The robbers came prepared. Police and witnesses said they brought three cars and a small truck to plunder Hyon Ki Yong’s trove of alcoholic drinks, which is worth more than $150,000 on the black market in a country where it is illegal for Muslims to consume alcohol.

The police, who recovered much of the stash soon after the Oct. 3 burglary, say that the three robbers were police officers and have issued arrest warrants for them and for a member of a well-known bootlegging family. They have also arrested Hyon’s housekeeper.

Senior police and customs officials say the discovery of such a large amount of liquor has led them to conclude that some North Korean diplomats are involved in selling alcohol either to make money for themselves or to provide funds for the cash-starved regime in Pyongyang.

The North Korean government is facing increasingly tough United Nations-backed economic sanctions because of its nuclear weapons and missile development programs.

“This North Korean was involved in liquor selling,” said a senior police official in Islamabad who is familiar with the investigation, in reference to Hyon.

The officer said North Korean diplomats in Pakistan had been doing this for years, though he didn’t provide direct evidence of such sales.

Reuters could not independently verify that Hyon had been selling alcohol.

A diplomat from the North Korean embassy declined to comment on Hyon’s case, or the wider allegations about alcohol sales.

“It has been discussed between the embassy and MOFA (Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs),” said the diplomat, who put the phone down before identifying himself. He did not respond to subsequent calls.

Reuters was unable to reach Hyon for comment.

The investigating police officer, Ishtiaq Hussain, said that the housekeeper, Boota Masih, had “confessed” to his role in the crime and had provided all the details.

Masih is in custody and he could not be reached for comment. Reuters couldn’t determine if he has a lawyer.

One of the officers being sought by police, Malik Asif, told Reuters when contacted by phone that he denies being involved in the burglary. He said he is currently in hiding.

He said he had no doubt that North Koreans were involved in the alcohol smuggling business.

“They have been doing this business for a long time,” he added.

PRESSURE FROM EMBASSIES

Some foreign diplomats in Islamabad have long-held suspicions that North Korean diplomats in Pakistan are involved in bootlegging.

They say they believe Pakistan has turned a blind eye to bootlegging by North Koreans, perhaps out of courtesy to the historic ties between the two countries. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani scientist lionised as the father of Pakistan’s atomic bomb, in 2004 said he had sold nuclear secrets to North Korea.

Pakistan denies being lax in policing such behaviour by North Korean diplomats. “No such activity has ever been, or shall ever be tolerated,” foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal told Reuters.

When asked about this particular case, Faisal said: ”Pakistan is actively investigating the case and any indiscretion, if proven, will be punished as per national and international laws.”

Pakistan has also always denied helping North Korea with its nuclear program.

This summer, the U.S. embassy in Islamabad along with South Korean and Japanese counterparts lodged a complaint with Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the size of the North Korean mission in Pakistan, because they wanted to reduce its ability to raise funds for Pyongyang by reselling imported alcohol, according to diplomatic sources in Islamabad and Seoul.

The Japanese and South Koreans had been making such requests for more than a year, according to a source in Seoul. A Japanese foreign ministry source has denied knowledge of the demarche.

The source in Seoul estimates North Korea has 12-14 diplomats in Pakistan, split between Islamabad and Karachi, prompting some diplomats to wonder why Pyongyang needs so many representatives when – according to Pakistan central bank data - its official trade with Pakistan has ceased since August 2016.

Washington has been tightening the diplomatic and economic noose around North Korea, seeking to cut its foreign sources of funding amid fears the world’s most isolated regime is on the cusp of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to American shores.

The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan declined to comment.

Japan’s foreign ministry declined to comment.

The South Korean foreign ministry said: “Our government is closely monitoring any movement concerning illegal activities of North Korea but we cannot officially confirm this case.”

Pakistan’s foreign ministry didn’t respond to questions about the pressure it faced from other nations over the size of North Korea’s mission.

“ANGRY AND UPSET”

When Hyon discovered the robbery on Oct. 4 after returning to Islamabad from a trip to China, the diplomat rushed to the nearby police station to report the crime.

“He was angry and upset,” said Hussain, the police officer who interviewed Hyon in Islamabad’s Kohsar police station. “And very worried.”

Hyon told the police the robbers had fled with 1,200 bottles of Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky, 200 cases of wine, 60 cartons of beer, dozens of bottles of tequila, two diamonds and $3,000 in cash, according to a police document reviewed by Reuters. On the black market, the whisky alone is worth $80 per bottle, or a total $96,000.

Hyon and the North Korean embassy told police the alcohol was imported legally and presented documents to back up its case. Police declined to make the documents available.

A week after the robbery, North Korea’s ambassador to Pakistan met the foreign ministry’s chief of protocol and requested Hyon’s missing items be returned, according to a Pakistani foreign ministry document seen by Reuters.

It is unclear whether Hyon, who would have diplomatic immunity, is himself under investigation.

Documents reviewed by Reuters showing four separate alcohol import orders by North Korea’s embassy between March-December 2016 paint a picture of a mission importing alcoholic drinks that would be far above any reasonable personal needs of its diplomats.

During the nine-month period, the embassy imported 10,542 bottles of French Bordeaux wine through Truebell, a United Arab Emirates-based company. The four orders, billed by Truebell at $72,867, also included a total of 17,322 cans of Heineken and Carlsberg beer, as well as 646 bottles of champagne.

A person who answered the phone on Truebell’s Sharjah, UAE number told Reuters that the company no longer has any dealing with North Korea, but did not elaborate, and would not answer any more questions.

ALCOHOL QUOTAS

Alcohol is a sensitive issue in Pakistan.

Muslims, by law, are not allowed to consume alcohol but many among the Westernised elite drink.

Non-Muslims such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs, accounting for about 3 percent of the population between them, are allowed to drink alcohol but obtaining high-quality imported liquor and wine is almost impossible through legal means.

This has spawned a lucrative black market. Alcohol is smuggled across borders and through sea ports, while several diplomats from poorer countries told Reuters they had been offered thousands of dollars by bootleggers to buy their quarterly ”alcohol quotas.”

“I’ve been approached five times, usually at diplomatic receptions,” said one non-Western diplomat.

Under Pakistan’s rules, Hyon, who has the first secretary rank at the North Korean embassy, would every three months be allowed to import a consignment of alcohol. Under one of the allowed formulas that would mean 120 litres of various spirits, 18 litres of wine and 240 litres of beer – only a fraction of the amount he reported missing.","Insight: In Pakistan, North Korean diplomat's alcohol stash raises bootlegging suspicions",https://www.reuters.com/article/pakistan-northkorea/insight-in-pakistan-north-korean-diplomats-alcohol-stash-raises-bootlegging-suspicions-idINKBN1D80XM

Weakened by losing her party’s majority in a June election, May faces another crisis after her defense minister resigned in a sexual harassment scandal, leaving the government with “the stench of death” to it, according to an opposition lawmaker.

Patel, a Brexit campaigner who is popular in the governing Conservative Party, was heading back to London after cancelling meetings on a planned trip to Africa to respond to media reports that she failed to declare meetings with Israeli officials in a breach of diplomatic protocol.

Asked whether Patel should be dismissed, the new defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, told reporters in Brussels: “The prime minister makes her own decision on actually who is serving in her cabinet, and they’re only the prime minister’s decisions.”

Under British protocol, a cabinet minister would normally organize meetings through the foreign office and be accompanied by officials, and visits with Israelis would typically be balanced with meetings with Palestinians. Patel was also reported to have visited the Golan Heights, territory disputed between Israel and Syria, which British officials tend to avoid.

Whether Patel is sacked or not, the scandal is the latest to rattle May, who is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party in parliament to make laws - increasingly important as Britain navigates its departure from the European Union.

She lost close ally Michael Fallon, her defense secretary, last week, and her deputy Damian Green and another minister are under investigation as part of the sexual harassment scandal in parliament.

On Tuesday, her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was pressed to apologize over remarks he made about a jailed aid worker in Iran, which critics said could prompt Tehran to hand her a longer jail term.

Opposition lawmakers are openly questioning whether May has the strength to continue as prime minister.

“There are times when a government has the stench of death about it,” Pat McFadden, a lawmaker from the main opposition Labour Party, told parliament on Tuesday.

Patel apologized to May on Monday for failing to report that she had met senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a holiday.

On Wednesday, the Sun newspaper reported that she had also failed to disclose that she had met the director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Yuval Rotem, in New York and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan in London.

A government source confirmed those meetings took place.

The source said that no UK government officials were present for the discussions, and they were set up and reported in a way that did not accord with the usual procedures.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper also reported that Patel visited a field hospital of the Israeli Defence Forces in the Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war.

A spokesman for May denied that the prime minister had been aware of Patel’s meeting with Netanyahu in advance.

“It is not true that the prime minister knew about the International Development Secretary’s meeting with PM Netanyahu before Friday Nov. 3,” the spokesman said.",Further blow to Britain's May as aid minister's future in doubt,https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-politics-patel/further-blow-to-britains-may-as-aid-ministers-future-in-doubt-idINKBN1D80R9?il=0

The Senate’s approval is needed to pass laws though it does not often block bills passed by the elected House of Commons. Some senators say police need more time to prepare and also oppose setting the federal age of legal use at 18.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use was part of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s 2015 election campaign and the government has set a relatively quick deadline to put it in place. Canada would be the first Group of Seven country to allow the drug nationally.

The legislation is not expected to reach the upper house until December and some senators have said they will take as long as they need to review it.

That could put Trudeau and the upper house of parliament at loggerheads again. Senators, who are not elected, recently delayed the government’s budget bill before ultimately passing it.

Conservative Senator Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu said he expects implementation will need to be delayed until December 2018 or early 2019 to give police forces enough time to prepare for widespread use of the drug.

“I think it’s too early,” Boisvenu said on Friday by phone. “What they’ve (the police) told us until today is they will not be prepared next July.”

Boisvenu said Conservative senators will meet to discuss strategy about delaying the bill if necessary.

Member of Parliament Bill Blair, a former police chief and the government’s point person on the legislation, said added delays in regulation will put more underage users at risk.

“By all means, take the time to do it right, but unnecessary delay is unacceptable,” Blair said by phone.

The potential clash highlights a hurdle Trudeau has partly set up for himself after he expelled all Liberal senators from the party’s caucus in 2014 amid an expenses scandal and to curb partisanship.

Although Trudeau has appointed independent senators since then, he has no formal leverage to get the government’s legislation passed.

“The government, if it had a clear majority in the Senate, could at one point impose party discipline and have its bill voted on.

Protesters shut down roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, and some public transport ran minimum services in response to calls for action by two civic groups -- whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- and a labor union.

People stood across dozens of major highways in the region waving placards and chanting “freedom for political prisoners”, TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters.

While many smaller stores left their shutters closed, most larger shops and businesses in the region appeared to be open as normal.

An uphill task awaited the political heavyweights of the independence campaign, whose parties jointly ran Catalonia for the last two years until Madrid sacked the region’s government in response to its independence push.

Deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont’s center-right PDeCAT and the leftist ERC of former regional vice president Oriol Junqueras had until midnight on Tuesday to agree a new pact, but they failed to meet that deadline, meaning they will contest the Dec. 21 vote as separate parties.

The central government in Madrid called the election last month after assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament’s unilateral independence declaration.

Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, while Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds.

‘JUNCKER WON‘T MEET ME’

Puigdemont, who faces the same charges and is the subject of a extradition request from Madrid, had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union.

But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc’s executive.

“(EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn’t want to meet me,” Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard.

“I’ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now, are wrecking Europe ... The gap between the Europe of the people and the official Europe is increasing.”

Catalonia’s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, triggered a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the country’s civil war in the 1930s.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month’s election would usher in “a period of calm” and business as usual for the region.

“I‘m hoping for massive participation in the election.. and, after that, we’ll return to normality,” he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday.

An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras’ ERC could garner between 45 and 46 seats in Catalonia’s 135-strong regional assembly while Puigdemont’s PdeCat would win just 14 or 15.

In order to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority, they would then have to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP.

ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a banking conference in Madrid he hoped the election would revive the Catalan success story “during which it has enjoyed great economic and cultural prosperity together with a high level of self-governance.”

For some Catalans who ignored Wednesday’s strike -- called by the CSC union and supported by civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural -- that moment is already overdue.

“Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary. In this world we have to work and not argue so much,” Jose Luis, a construction worker, told Reuters TV as he walked through Barcelona on his way to work.

As his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has handed the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed more and more power over the past three years, the ambitious young leader has taken on everything from economic reforms to waging war in neighboring Yemen. Here is what you need to know.

ROYAL POLITICS

Prince Mohammed capped his rapid rise to power in June this year by replacing his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, widely known as MbN, as crown prince.

A source close to King Salman said MbN’s dismissal was “in the higher interests of the state” because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction, a legacy of an assassination attempt that left shrapnel in his body.

Reuters could not independently confirm MbN’s addiction issues.

ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN

Prince Mohammed tightened his grip on power with the start of the anti-corruption campaign at the weekend, purging the kingdom’s political and business elite. Among those arrested were 11 princes.

Many Saudis welcomed the moves as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds by the powerful. U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years” but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

YEMEN

Prince Mohammed launched a military campaign in neighboring Yemen in March 2015. A Saudi-led coalition, acting on an invitation from the internationally-recognized government, has targeted the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people.

The war is closely identified with the prince in his role as defense minister. His image once adorned war propaganda but is rarely associated with the war now, although he has said it must continue in order to quash Iranian influence.

Even before the conflict, Yemen was the poorest country on the Arabian peninsula and now millions of people there are facing famine and a cholera epidemic. The coalition denies it blocks commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel.

QATAR

Prince Mohammed has helped lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Qatar, saying Riyadh’s erstwhile ally backs terrorism and cozies up to Iran. Qatar rejects the accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors’ backing for authoritarian rulers.

The campaign has divided Gulf Arab countries, who Washington regards as essential to its influence in the region. Qatar had incensed Riyadh by cheering Arab Spring uprisings against some autocratic Arab rulers.

CONFRONTATION WITH IRAN

Saudi Arabia’s rivalry with Iran, its competitor for influence in the Middle East, has deepened as King Salman and Prince Mohammed worked to build a Sunni coalition against Tehran and its allies in the Arab world.

In May, as deputy crown prince, Prince Mohammed used unusually provocative language to rule out dialogue with revolutionary Shi‘ite Muslim theocracy Iran, which he said was trying to interfere in Arab lands and dominate the Muslim world.

On Tuesday, state media quoted him as describing Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen as “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Prince Mohammed has also opened a new front in the proxy war with Iran by threatening Tehran’s ally Hezbollah and its home country Lebanon. The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh, was widely seen as the first act on this new front.

The crown prince has also sought the help of Shi‘ite leaders in Iraq to try to reverse Iran’s dominant role there and shore up security on the kingdom’s northern border, and has tried to improve ties with the United States under Trump, who shares his and King Salman’s antipathy to Iran’s government.

SAUDI ARAMCO

The planned sale of about 5 percent of national oil company Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] next year is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s blueprint to move the economy away from what he called its “addiction to oil” toward the private sector.

The IPO is expected to raise as much as $100 billion but investors wonder whether Aramco can be valued anywhere close to the $2 trillion figure announced by the crown prince and there has been market speculation that the IPO could be delayed beyond 2018 or shelved. He recently stated it would happen next year.

Many Saudis have misgivings about the sale, with some fearing Riyadh is selling cheaply at a time of low oil prices.

ECONOMIC REFORMS

Vision 2030 has begun to reduce a big state budget deficit with austerity measures but has not yet created major new sources of non-oil growth or jobs.

The phased removal of subsidies on fuel, water and electricity has started but some austerity moves have been unpopular. Already, some have been reversed or delayed as the economy has slowed because of low oil prices.

The plan includes private investment and privatizations and building the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The aim is to create jobs and raise the participation of women in the workforce from 22 percent now to 30 percent by 2030.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Saudi Arabia adheres to an austere Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas.

Prince Mohammed’s ascent represents a social and cultural sea change, with power set to be passed to a much younger generation seemingly more in tune with young Saudis. In moves that reinforce that perception, women will be permitted to drive from next year and allowed to attend sports events.

The crown prince has also said the country will move to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam, and reforms have begun in areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy such as education, courts and the law. Saudi authorities have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date Islam.

NEOM

Last month Prince Mohammed announced a $500-billion plan to create a business and industrial zone extending across its borders into Jordan and Egypt, part of his efforts to reduce dependence on oil.

The 26,500 square-km (10,230 square-mile) zone, known as NEOM, will focus on industries including energy and water, biotechnology, food, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, and will power itself solely with wind power and solar energy.

The crown prince says the government, Public Investment Fund and local and international investors are expected to sink billions into the zone in coming years. The crown prince told Reuters NEOM would be floated on financial markets alongside Aramco.",Shifting sands: What is changing in Saudi Arabia?,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-milestones/shifting-sands-what-is-changing-in-saudi-arabia-idUSKBN1D8181

Bei der Frage der sogenannten aktiven Abwehr gebe es bisher keinen Konsens, sagte de Maiziere am Mittwoch in Berlin bei der Vorstellung des aktuellen Lageberichts des Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI). Zugleich mahnte der CDU-Politiker die Sondierer von Union, FDP und Grüne in der Frage zur Eile. “Ich hoffe nicht, dass wir eine solche Entscheidung erst fällen, wenn wir Gegenstand eines großflächigen Angriffs geworden sind, dessen weitere Ausbreitung wir dann nicht verhindern können.”

Übereinstimmung gebe es in den Sondierungen bisher nur bei der Organisation der Sicherheitsarchitektur im Cyber-Bereich. So sei die derzeitige Verteilung von Kompetenzen auf Bundes- und Landesebene der Lage nicht angemessen. Vielmehr werde eine Bündelung unter dem Dach des BSI benötigt. Auch das gemeinsame Cyber-Abwehrzentrum solle nach dem Willen der Sondierer gestärkt werden, sagte de Maiziere.

Er persönlich halte es für richtig, wenn zur Abwehr einer unmittelbar bevorstehenden Gefahr für Deutschland oder seiner zentralen Infrastruktur sowie zur Vermeidung weiterer Schäden der Angriff an seinem Ursprungsort beendet werde. Eine Präferenz, welche Bundesbehörde über eine solche Cyber-Gegenattacke entscheide, habe er nicht. Darüber müsse die neue Bundesregierung befinden. Derartige Kompetenzen hatte Anfang Oktober der Bundesverfassungsschutz gefordert.

Nach Angaben de Maizieres ist in der deutschen Wirtschaft insgesamt das Bewusstsein gestiegen, welche Gefahren Cyber-Angriffe bergen. Im Mittelstand sei dieses Bewusstsein aber noch nicht ausgereift genug. Dem BSI zufolge entstehen durch die immer stärkere Vernetzung von Alltagsgeräten wie Kühlschränken oder Autos im sogenannten “Internet der Dinge” zusätzliche Risiken.

Carles Puigdemont’s secessionist alliance was threatening to unravel, with the region’s biggest grass-roots independence organisation unhappy about his plan. So he called a meeting of political allies on the eve of his departure for Brussels, according to three sources with first-hand knowledge of the events.

In the rural hamlet of Vilahur, near Puigdemont’s home town, he and seven others, including the deputy chief of the grass-roots Catalan National Assembly (ANC), met over dinner at a farmhouse in the expectation Puigdemont and others present would be arrested for rebellion within hours, one source said.

Puigdemont told the group he was not running away from a fight, as ANC officials feared it would be perceived, and that he would use Brussels, home to the EU parliament and commission, as a stage to continue to speak out against Spain’s crackdown on the independence movement, the source added.

After adjourning for the night, the group resumed the next morning at the farmhouse and agreed to back his plan. Crucially, that plan also included a commitment to contest snap regional elections called by Madrid for Dec. 21 rather than boycott them as the ANC first envisaged.

On reaching agreement, Puigdemont told them he was prepared to “spend 30 years in prison” for the cause and the others embraced him in what the source described as an emotional farewell. ANC deputy leader Agusti Alcoberro was among them.

The account of the meeting reveals how the independence movement’s leadership managed to overcome deep-rooted internal divisions and agree a rough game plan for the weeks ahead. While the two main pro-independence parties finally chose on Tuesday to contest the elections under their own brand rather than a joint ticket, their manifestos will be coordinated and they are still expected to join forces after the vote.

An opinion poll this week showed that pro-independence parties would win the largest share of the vote, though a majority was not assured and question marks remain over Puigdemont’s leadership of the pro-independence cause. Puigdemont could not be reached for comment.

WRONG-FOOTED

At the time of the Vilahur talks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy seemed to hold the upper hand. He had surprised the secessionists by calling elections much sooner than they had expected, according to sources close to Puigdemont.

A disparate collection of parties whose only common thread is independence, Puigdemont’s coalition had been bickering over what some saw as his timid tactics. Some had even been talking of boycotting the election, which could have spelled the end of the movement.

“He was wrong-footed by Rajoy’s tough response,” said an ally of Puigdemont.

When Rajoy dropped his election bombshell, Puigdemont was still celebrating the regional assembly’s vote earlier that day to declare Catalonia a republic.

The Catalan leader had to move quickly to secure consensus for the Brussels plan and, more importantly, for his unwieldy coalition to contest the elections, which had been called by a nation they no longer considered themselves to be a part of.

In Puigdemont’s first meeting late on Oct. 27, in Barcelona’s regional parliament building, the coalition decided that only a few ministers would go with him to Brussels and the rest would stay and defend themselves against any prosecution for sedition, said sources briefed on that meeting.

Afterwards, he drove to Girona, the town he had run as mayor. In a courtyard of a government building, he filmed a message calling for non-violent opposition to Rajoy’s takeover of the region. It was televised by Catalan public broadcaster TV3 which called him “president”.

Later, he lunched with his wife and two friends at a local wine bar and walked with them to Girona’s Placa de la Independencia (Independence Square) where he posed for photos while applauding onlookers shouted “Long Live Catalonia”.

Despite the defiant scene, the day was not going well for the newly declared Catalan republic.

Rajoy was receiving backing from world powers including France, Germany and the United States. Spanish authorities were already taking over Catalan government offices.

THE FLEMISH CONNECTION

However, Puigdemont got some news that appeared to justify his Brussels strategy just as he and four of his ex-ministers were making their way there.

Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, said that if Puigdemont were to seek political asylum in Belgium, it would be “not unrealistic” to grant it. Belgium is one of few EU states where EU citizens can request asylum.

Francken belongs to Flemish nationalist party N-VA, which is supportive of Catalan self-determination. He said no asylum request had yet been made but events were “moving fast”.

Puigdemont was meanwhile in a friend’s car heading for Marseilles, southern France, where he would board a flight to Brussels. To elude Spanish police, someone drove his official car in a different direction.

Since arriving in Brussels, Puigdemont and the four ex-ministers who accompanied him there have been slapped with European arrest warrants for rebellion and sedition, crimes carrying up to 30 years in jail.

Back in Spain, eight other ex-ministers have been jailed pending an investigation and potential trial for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.

As the House tax committee weighed amendments to a bill that Democrats have blasted as a give-away to corporations and the rich, the Washington tax reform debate was fast shifting to the Senate, where Republicans hold only a slim majority.

Senate Republicans are expected to unveil their own tax bill at the end of the week, and early indications suggest it could differ significantly from the House legislation.

The House is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior Republican said.

Tax reform has been a priority for President Donald Trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth. But Republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

Trump made another pitch for Democratic support on Capitol Hill, where his top aides met with about a dozen Senate Democrats and Trump himself phoned in from his Asia trip.

“He said, ‘Look … I want to do it in a bipartisan way,'” Senator Joe Donnelly told reporters.

Fitch Ratings predicted that a Republican tax plan would win passage in both chambers, but did not see it offering long-term benefits.

“Such reform would deliver a modest and temporary spur to growth. ... However, it will lead to wider fiscal deficits and add significantly to U.S. government debt,” Fitch said, revising up its medium-term U.S. government debt forecast.

The U.S. national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Republicans once firmly opposed adding to the debt, but their emphasis has changed. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) said the House bill would add nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt from 2018 through 2027.

Trump and congressional Republicans say the proposed tax cuts would boost economic growth enough to generate new revenues that would offset the tax cuts. Few economists agree.

The House bill slashes tax rates for large corporations, small businesses and wealthy Americans, while sharply reducing or eliminating tax breaks that benefit many middle-class Americans such as deductions for state and local taxes, college tuition and home mortgage interest.

JCT estimates that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023.

House Republicans, who have an overwhelming majority, drafted their bill in secret, ignoring Democrats.

But the House bill is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 seat majority and they need to pay heed to moderates within their own ranks as well as Democrats, lobbyists and analysts said.

Two conservative Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have already voiced concern that the House tax bill could raise taxes on some middle-class Americans.

The Senate bill could delay the proposed corporate tax cut by one year, may not allow any deductions for local property taxes, and may not collapse the current seven individual brackets to the four proposed by the House, according to the Washington Post.

PRESSURE TO DELIVER

Republican leaders have pushed for the House to vote on the tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23.

“My donors are basically saying, get it done or don’t ever call me again,” Republican Representative Chris Collins said.

U.S. tax legislation must begin in the House. “We’ll bring it to the floor next week,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News.

In party-line votes on Tuesday, Brady’s tax committee voted down eight Democratic amendments that would have preserved or expanded tax breaks for the middle class, nullified the tax legislation if it increased the deficit in future years and maintained taxes on foreign profits of U.S. corporations.

Brady offered a sweeping amendment on Monday that tweaked at least half a dozen provisions of the 425-page bill.

One related to carried interest income, a share of an investment fund’s profits paid out to the fund’s general partners and which represents a large portion of many fund managers’ incomes. Carried interest currently is taxed at the capital gains rate, which is substantially lower than the personal income tax rate for higher earners. Brady’s amendment would lengthen to more than three years from one the time period assets must be held in order to be eligible for the capital gains tax rate.

The amendment would also reduce the amount of carried-interest income eligible for the lower rate.",Republican tax plans gain speed; Fitch warns on deficit,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/republican-tax-plans-gain-speed-fitch-warns-on-deficit-idUSKBN1D72IN?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”

“Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit.

Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations.

Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.”

He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.”

The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

“The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region.

‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’

In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance.

While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures.

During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul.

He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed.

The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official.

Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added.

Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday.

Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said.

While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions.

‘GRAVE DANGER’

Slideshow (16 Images)

During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”

However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach.

North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving.

“North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.

He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader.

Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.”

The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said.

A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.

“The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One.

Protesters shut down roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, and some public transport ran minimum services in response to calls for action by two civic groups -- whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- and a labor union.

People stood across dozens of major highways in the region waving placards and chanting “freedom for political prisoners”, TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters.

While many smaller stores left their shutters closed, most larger shops and businesses in the region appeared to be open as normal.

An uphill task awaited the political heavyweights of the independence campaign, whose parties jointly ran Catalonia for the last two years until Madrid sacked the region’s government in response to its independence push.

Deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont’s center-right PDeCAT and the leftist ERC of former regional vice president Oriol Junqueras had until midnight on Tuesday to agree a new pact, but they failed to meet that deadline, meaning they will contest the Dec. 21 vote as separate parties.

The central government in Madrid called the election last month after assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament’s unilateral independence declaration.

Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, while Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds.

‘JUNCKER WON‘T MEET ME’

Puigdemont, who faces the same charges and is the subject of a extradition request from Madrid, had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union.

But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc’s executive.

“(EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn’t want to meet me,” Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard.

“I’ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now, are wrecking Europe ... The gap between the Europe of the people and the official Europe is increasing.”

Catalonia’s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, triggered a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the country’s civil war in the 1930s.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month’s election would usher in “a period of calm” and business as usual for the region.

“I‘m hoping for massive participation in the election.. and, after that, we’ll return to normality,” he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday.

An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras’ ERC could garner between 45 and 46 seats in Catalonia’s 135-strong regional assembly while Puigdemont’s PdeCat would win just 14 or 15.

In order to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority, they would then have to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP.

ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a banking conference in Madrid he hoped the election would revive the Catalan success story “during which it has enjoyed great economic and cultural prosperity together with a high level of self-governance.”

For some Catalans who ignored Wednesday’s strike -- called by the CSC union and supported by civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural -- that moment is already overdue.

“Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary. In this world we have to work and not argue so much,” Jose Luis, a construction worker, told Reuters TV as he walked through Barcelona on his way to work.

Dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have already been held in the purge announced on Saturday. They face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain.

But the sources, speaking on Wednesday, said a number of other individuals suspected of wrongdoing were detained in an expansion of the crackdown, widely seen as an initiative of the powerful heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Others under scrutiny are being telephoned by investigators about their finances but appear to remain at liberty, one of the sources said, adding that the number of people targeted by the crackdown was expected eventually to rise into the hundreds.

The number of domestic bank accounts frozen as a result of the purge is over 1,700 and rising, up from 1,200 reported on Tuesday, banking sources said.

A number of those held most recently include individuals with links to the immediate family of the late Crown Prince and Defence Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz who died in 2011, the sources said.

STOCKS FALL

Others appear to be lower-level managers and officials, one of the sources said.

Many Saudis have cheered the purge as an attack on the theft of state funds by the rich, and U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years”.

But some Western officials expressed apprehension at the possible ramifications for the secretive tribal and royal politics of the world’s largest oil exporter.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market continued to fall in early trade on Wednesday because of concern about the economic impact of its anti-corruption purge. The Saudi index .TASI was 1.0 percent lower after half an hour of trade. Shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation slid further.

Late on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi central bank sought to ease worries about the crackdown.

They said that while individuals were being targeted and having their bank accounts frozen, national and multinational companies - including those wholly or partly owned by individuals under investigation - would not be disrupted.

Anti-corruption authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of the most senior members of the ruling Al Saud, and some of his immediate family members, the sources added.

Prince Mohammed, or MbN as he is known, was ousted as Crown Prince in June when King Salman replaced him with the then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Since Sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.

RIGHTS CONCERNS

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since his ousting at the funeral on Tuesday for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

Among business executives detained in the probe so far are billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE; Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar, founder of Al Tayyar Travel 1810.SE; and Amr al-Dabbagh, chairman of builder Red Sea International 4230.SE.

The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had urged Saudi Arabia to carry out any prosecution of officials detained in a “fair and transparent” manner.

Commenting on the purge, Human Rights Watch called on Saudi authorities to “immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person’s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights”.

“It’s great that Saudi authorities are declaring that they want to take on the scourge of corruption, but the right way to do that is through diligent judicial investigations against actual wrongdoing, not sensationalistic mass arrests to a luxury hotel,” Right Watch official Sarah Leah Whitson in a statement.",Saudi Arabia makes fresh arrests in anti-graft crackdown: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arrests-detentions/saudi-arabia-makes-fresh-arrests-in-anti-graft-crackdown-sources-idUKKBN1D81FL

They say that the region is in a perfect position to benefit from rapidly declining prices in solar panels. It has strong economic growth, relatively high costs of electricity and a shortage from traditional sources, undeveloped infrastructure in more remote areas, plenty of sunshine, and backing for more renewable energy from many of Southeast Asia’s governments.

“Dramatically falling costs for solar energy technologies means businesses and governments are choosing renewable energy not for environmental reasons but for economic ones,” said Roberto De Vido, spokesman for Singapore-based Equis, one of Asia’s biggest green energy-focused investment firms with $2.7 billion in committed capital. “It simply makes good business sense. And that’s a trend that’s not going to change,”

By the end of last year, Southeast Asia had installed solar capacity of only just over 3 gigawatts (GW), a mere 1 percent of global capacity, according to data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

Steve O’Neil, the chief executive of Singapore-based solar panel maker REC, said he expects that to grow by 5 GW of new installations every year between 2017-2020. That’s the equivalent of building five standard fossil-fuel power stations annually.

""People don't realize what is about to happen, when you're in the middle of exponential growth,"" said REC's O'Neil. ""It's transformational.

Some European funds are among those looking at the region.

“The projects on offer in Europe are stagnating, so European investors are looking in that direction with great interest,” said Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for Infrastructure Equity at Allianz Global Investors, whose team manages 1.6 billion euros ($1.76 billion) worth of renewable investments.

“In Asia, you’d expect double-digit returns. That’s hard to achieve in Europe,” he said.

Southeast Asia has a population of more than 600 million and annual power demand growth of 6 percent, which most countries struggle to meet.

Solar power potential is measured by Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), a measurement of the intensity of the sun. Thailand has a GHI that can produce 1,600 to 2,000 kilowatt-hours of solar power per square meter (kWh/m2), well above the 1,000 to 1,200 kWh/m2 in Europe’s solar leader Germany, according to solar weather and data provider Solargis.

The region is ripe for a boom because solar panel prices have crashed to under 50 cents per watt of electricity today from $70 per watt in 1980 as technology and manufacturing efficiency have improved consistently.

At the same time, Southeast Asian countries have all set ambitious renewable energy targets, ranging from 18 percent of overall energy generation mix in Thailand and Malaysia to 35 percent in the Philippines, up from negligible levels today.

There are, of course, still risks for investors - including currency volatility, the difficulties of making land acquisitions, and usually the lack of any government guarantees, said Sharad Somani, head of Asia/Pacific Power & Utilities at KPMG.

Storing solar power through the night remains a hurdle too, though battery technology is improving rapidly.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Bringing together international investors, panel makers, and potential users is a small but growing group of venture capital firms, mostly based in Singapore.

GA Power is one such firm. Led by German solar business veterans, it focuses entirely on financing and developing solar projects across Southeast Asia.

“There is more money than there are projects. If you can offer professional developed projects, you’ll have no issue organizing funding,” said Roland Quast, GA Power’s managing director, adding that “a solar boom in Southeast Asia is unavoidable” given it is now a competitive power source.

Slideshow (14 Images)

He said an investor can expect around a 12 percent economic internal rate of return on average in the region. The measurement reflects returns after costs for the construction, installation, and operation of a project.

Mid-sized solar projects that can be turned on without having to tap into a larger grid are in favor in the region as governments seek to bring power to an area without having to add expensive infrastructure, Quast said.

KPMG’s Somani, who is an adviser in the renewables sector, said that Equis and other funds are raising capital with U.S. and European institutional investors, including pension funds. Equis declined to provide detail on the sources of its money.

“Today we have unique confluence of all three factors necessary for success of such projects – demand for projects from government/utility side supported by conducive regulatory framework, strong developer and supplier interest and abundance of domestic and international financing availability,” Somani said.

KILLER ARGUMENT

At the REC solar panel factory in Singapore, one of Singapore’s biggest manufacturing sites, a thousand workers and more than a hundred robots work around the clock, churning out 20 containers full of panels every day, which are immediately sent to overseas customers, increasingly to Southeast Asia.

“We produce 14,000 panels per day, which go into 20 containers, 24/7. We never stop,” REC’s O‘Neil told Reuters during a recent visit to the factory.

Founded in Norway, headquartered in Singapore, and owned by Chinese industrial giant ChemChina, O‘Neil says that REC sells globally, but that he expects “Southeast Asia to become a game-changer.”

In 2016, REC grew by just 3 percent in Southeast Asia - excluding the huge solar markets of India, China and Australia. This year, it expects 5 percent growth in the region, and then 9 to 10 percent growth annually between 2018 and 2020.

The business is cut-throat. Cheap Chinese production of solar panels has left a trail of collapsed companies in its wake - the bankruptcies of Germany’s SolarWorld, once Europe’s biggest panel maker, and major U.S. panel maker Suniva are among them.

To survive, REC says it needs to be in a relentless drive to improve productivity, including employing low-wage Malaysian workers and automating as much as possible.

“Our panels are now cheaper than a same-sized window,” said O‘Neil.",Here comes the sun: investors increasingly hot on solar projects in S.E. Asia,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-renewables-analysis/here-comes-the-sun-investors-increasingly-hot-on-solar-projects-in-s-e-asia-idUSKBN18Y0DU

The robbers came prepared. Police and witnesses said they brought three cars and a small truck to plunder Hyon Ki Yong’s trove of alcoholic drinks, which is worth more than $150,000 on the black market in a country where it is illegal for Muslims to consume alcohol.

The police, who recovered much of the stash soon after the Oct. 3 burglary, say that the three robbers were police officers and have issued arrest warrants for them and for a member of a well-known bootlegging family. They have also arrested Hyon’s housekeeper.

Senior police and customs officials say the discovery of such a large amount of liquor has led them to conclude that some North Korean diplomats are involved in selling alcohol either to make money for themselves or to provide funds for the cash-starved regime in Pyongyang.

The North Korean government is facing increasingly tough United Nations-backed economic sanctions because of its nuclear weapons and missile development programs.

“This North Korean was involved in liquor selling,” said a senior police official in Islamabad who is familiar with the investigation, in reference to Hyon.

The officer said North Korean diplomats in Pakistan had been doing this for years, though he didn’t provide direct evidence of such sales.

Reuters could not independently verify that Hyon had been selling alcohol.

A diplomat from the North Korean embassy declined to comment on Hyon’s case, or the wider allegations about alcohol sales.

“It has been discussed between the embassy and MOFA (Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs),” said the diplomat, who put the phone down before identifying himself. He did not respond to subsequent calls.

Reuters was unable to reach Hyon for comment.

The investigating police officer, Ishtiaq Hussain, said that the housekeeper, Boota Masih, had “confessed” to his role in the crime and had provided all the details.

Masih is in custody and he could not be reached for comment. Reuters couldn’t determine if he has a lawyer.

One of the officers being sought by police, Malik Asif, told Reuters when contacted by phone that he denies being involved in the burglary. He said he is currently in hiding.

He said he had no doubt that North Koreans were involved in the alcohol smuggling business.

“They have been doing this business for a long time,” he added.

PRESSURE FROM EMBASSIES

Some foreign diplomats in Islamabad have long-held suspicions that North Korean diplomats in Pakistan are involved in bootlegging.

They say they believe Pakistan has turned a blind eye to bootlegging by North Koreans, perhaps out of courtesy to the historic ties between the two countries. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani scientist lionized as the father of Pakistan’s atomic bomb, in 2004 said he had sold nuclear secrets to North Korea.

Pakistan denies being lax in policing such behavior by North Korean diplomats. “No such activity has ever been, or shall ever be tolerated,” foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Faisal told Reuters.

When asked about this particular case, Faisal said: ”Pakistan is actively investigating the case and any indiscretion, if proven, will be punished as per national and international laws.”

Pakistan has also always denied helping North Korea with its nuclear program.

This summer, the U.S. embassy in Islamabad along with South Korean and Japanese counterparts lodged a complaint with Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the size of the North Korean mission in Pakistan, because they wanted to reduce its ability to raise funds for Pyongyang by reselling imported alcohol, according to diplomatic sources in Islamabad and Seoul.

The Japanese and South Koreans had been making such requests for more than a year, according to a source in Seoul. A Japanese foreign ministry source has denied knowledge of the demarche.

The source in Seoul estimates North Korea has 12-14 diplomats in Pakistan, split between Islamabad and Karachi, prompting some diplomats to wonder why Pyongyang needs so many representatives when – according to Pakistan central bank data - its official trade with Pakistan has ceased since August 2016.

Washington has been tightening the diplomatic and economic noose around North Korea, seeking to cut its foreign sources of funding amid fears the world’s most isolated regime is on the cusp of developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to American shores.

The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan declined to comment.

Japan’s foreign ministry declined to comment.

The South Korean foreign ministry said: “Our government is closely monitoring any movement concerning illegal activities of North Korea but we cannot officially confirm this case.”

Pakistan’s foreign ministry didn’t respond to questions about the pressure it faced from other nations over the size of North Korea’s mission.

“ANGRY AND UPSET”

Slideshow (3 Images)

When Hyon discovered the robbery on Oct. 4 after returning to Islamabad from a trip to China, the diplomat rushed to the nearby police station to report the crime.

“He was angry and upset,” said Hussain, the police officer who interviewed Hyon in Islamabad’s Kohsar police station. “And very worried.”

Hyon told the police the robbers had fled with 1,200 bottles of Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky, 200 cases of wine, 60 cartons of beer, dozens of bottles of tequila, two diamonds and $3,000 in cash, according to a police document reviewed by Reuters. On the black market, the whisky alone is worth $80 per bottle, or a total $96,000.

Hyon and the North Korean embassy told police the alcohol was imported legally and presented documents to back up its case. Police declined to make the documents available.

A week after the robbery, North Korea’s ambassador to Pakistan met the foreign ministry’s chief of protocol and requested Hyon’s missing items be returned, according to a Pakistani foreign ministry document seen by Reuters.

It is unclear whether Hyon, who would have diplomatic immunity, is himself under investigation.

Documents reviewed by Reuters showing four separate alcohol import orders by North Korea’s embassy between March-December 2016 paint a picture of a mission importing alcoholic drinks that would be far above any reasonable personal needs of its diplomats.

During the nine-month period, the embassy imported 10,542 bottles of French Bordeaux wine through Truebell, a United Arab Emirates-based company. The four orders, billed by Truebell at $72,867, also included a total of 17,322 cans of Heineken and Carlsberg beer, as well as 646 bottles of champagne.

A person who answered the phone on Truebell’s Sharjah, UAE number told Reuters that the company no longer has any dealing with North Korea, but did not elaborate, and would not answer any more questions.

ALCOHOL QUOTAS

Alcohol is a sensitive issue in Pakistan.

Muslims, by law, are not allowed to consume alcohol but many among the Westernized elite drink.

Non-Muslims such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs, accounting for about 3 percent of the population between them, are allowed to drink alcohol but obtaining high-quality imported liquor and wine is almost impossible through legal means.

This has spawned a lucrative black market. Alcohol is smuggled across borders and through sea ports, while several diplomats from poorer countries told Reuters they had been offered thousands of dollars by bootleggers to buy their quarterly ”alcohol quotas.”

“I’ve been approached five times, usually at diplomatic receptions,” said one non-Western diplomat.

Under Pakistan’s rules, Hyon, who has the first secretary rank at the North Korean embassy, would every three months be allowed to import a consignment of alcohol. Under one of the allowed formulas that would mean 120 liters of various spirits, 18 liters of wine and 240 liters of beer – only a fraction of the amount he reported missing.","In Pakistan, North Korean diplomat's alcohol stash raises bootlegging suspicions",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-northkorea-insight/in-pakistan-north-korean-diplomats-alcohol-stash-raises-bootlegging-suspicions-idUSKBN1D80XG

“Es ist auf jeden Fall richtig, dass wir auf eine zukunftsorientierte Wirtschaftspolitik achten sollten”, sagte die CDU-Chefin am Mittwoch bei der Übergabe des Jahresgutachtens durch die fünf Wirtschaftsweisen in Berlin. Allerdings seien Strukturreformen nicht so einfach, da gerade in guten Zeiten der Wunsch nach Verteilung dominiere. “Hier die richtige Balance zu finden, das ist unsere Aufgabe”, ergänzte Merkel mit Blick auf die Sondierung zwischen Union, FDP und Grünen zur Bildung einer gemeinsamen Regierung.

Der Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammertag (DIHK) hält Eile für geboten: “Zu groß ist mittlerweile der Handlungsbedarf auf wichtigen Reformfeldern, als dass eine neue Bundesregierung nicht mit Hochdruck an zentralen Standortfaktoren für die Wirtschaft arbeiten müsste”, sagte Hauptgeschäftsführer Martin Wansleben. Deutschland brauche etwa bis spätestens 2025 eine flächendeckende Glasfaser-Infrastruktur. Auch Steuerreformen seien notwendig. Entlastungen bei der Einkommensteuer und die schrittweise Abschaffung des Solidaritätszuschlages würde “Investitionsspielräume gerade des Mittelstandes vergrößern”. FDP-Chef Christian Lindner sieht aber wenig Chancen für eine große Steuerreform mit einem Volumen von 30 bis 40 Milliarden Euro, wie er kürzlich sagte.

“ROBUSTER AUFSCHWUNG”

Die Wirtschaftsweisen sprechen sich für eine Entlastung mittlerer Einkommen und eine Senkung des Beitragssatzes zur Arbeitslosenversicherung aus. “Deutschland befindet sich in einem robusten Aufschwung”, sagte der Chef des Expertengremiums, Christoph Schmidt. Das eröffne Spielräume. Es gehe darum, eine Mischung aus Finanzstabilität und Wachstumsstärkung zu verfolgen.

Für das kommende Jahr sagen die Experten der deutschen Wirtschaft ein Wachstum von 2,2 Prozent voraus. Die Bundesregierung erwartet lediglich 1,9 Prozent, die führenden Forschungsinstitute 2,0 Prozent. Für das laufende Jahr hob das Expertengremium seine Prognose von 1,4 auf 2,0 Prozent an. “Die deutsche Wirtschaft befindet sich in einem kräftigen und langanhaltenden Aufschwung”, heißt es in dem 463 Seiten starken Gutachten mit dem Titel “Für eine zukunftsorientierte Wirtschaftspolitik”. Darin wird für dieses Jahr ein gesamtstaatliche Haushaltsüberschuss von 31,3 Milliarden Euro oder einem Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts erwartet, so viel wie noch nie seit der Wiedervereinigung.

“Mit einer Tarifreform der Einkommenssteuer sollten Mehreinnahmen aus der kalten Progression zurückgegeben werden”, forderte der Sachverständigenrat. Durch diese schleichenden Steuererhöhungen habe der Staat seit 2009 mehr als 30 Milliarden Euro eingenommen, die nach und nach zurückgegeben werden könnten. Dies müsse abgestimmt werden mit einer “allmählichen” Abschaffung des Solidaritätszuschlags. Allerdings sollte der finanzpolitische Spielraum gewahrt werden. Deutschland könne es sich nicht leisten, “den Weg einer soliden Finanzpolitik zu verlassen”, mahnte der Rat.

Raum sieht er für niedrigere Sozialversicherungsbeiträge. So sei es angesichts der guten Lage möglich, den Beitragssatz zur Arbeitslosenversicherung um bis zu 0,5 Punkte zu senken. Die Rücklagen seien inzwischen so hoch, dass sogar ein Schock wie nach der weltweiten Finanzkrise 2008/09 abgefedert werden könnte, so der Sachverständige Lars Feld. Digitale Netze sollten im Grundsatz durch private Investitionen finanziert werden. Grundsätzlich sieht der Rat Raum für mehr öffentliche Investitionen in Deutschland, rät aber davon ab, diese auf Pump zu finanzieren. Ein mit der Lebenserwartung steigendes Renteneintrittsalter wird ebenfalls begrüßt.

Der Sachverständigenrat zur Begutachtung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Entwicklung wurde 1963 per Gesetz eingerichtet, um die Politik zu beraten. Vorsitzender ist seit 2013 der Ökonom Schmidt. Dem Gremium gehören außerdem Peter Bofinger, Lars Feld, Isabel Schnabel und Volker Wieland an.",Sachverständige fordern Reformen - Merkel und Wirtschaft offen,https://www.reuters.com/article/deuschland-wirtschaftsweise-merkel-idDEKBN1D81R1

Paddles’ rise to social media fame matched her 37-year-old owner’s meteoric ascent to the prime ministership after only taking over as leader of her Labour Party in August.

A “First Cat of NZ” Twitter account was set up by an anonymous user last month, featuring regular tweets about the photogenic cat’s famous “mummy”, Ardern, and quickly attracted 11,000 followers.

People from around the world posted messages such as “rest in peace” and “gone too soon” with the hashtag “#paddles”.

Paddles the polydactyl cat’s feats included being able to hold a pair of glasses with her opposable thumb and she featured regularly in photos of Ardern at work.

“To anyone who has ever lost a pet, you’ll know how sad we feel. Paddles was much loved, and not just by us. Thanks for everyone’s thoughts,” Ardern wrote on Facebook.

Ardern’s rise to power has generated intense interest in her personal life and drew comparisons with other youthful trailblazers such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Canada’s Justin Trudeau.

And, according to Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford, Paddles often played her part in affairs of state, even interrupting the premier’s first call with U.S. President Donald Trump in October.

“As the call was transferred our cat (yes that bloody cat) came flying through the cat-flap,” Gayford, a television presenter, wrote in a column for the Spinoff news website.

“She leapt up onto the chair next to Jacinda and began announcing her very squawky arrival,” he wrote.","New Zealand's Prime Moggy, Paddles the six-toed cat, meets an untimely end",https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idAFKBN1D808F

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday Moscow opposed a draft U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of the investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Ryabkov’s comments came hours after Russia rejected a report by the international inquiry blaming the Syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack on April 4.

In a joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the United States, the four countries said they had full confidence in the findings and called on the Syrian regime to end all use of poison gas and finally declare to the OPCW all the chemical weapons it possesses.

“We therefore urge the United Nations Security Council to maintain the investigative capacity” of the inquiry, the statement said.

“After such a report, the Security Council and all its members have a common responsibility to protect the international non-proliferation regime and to respect their previous commitments,” the joint statement said.

The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The April 4 attack prompted a U.S. missile strike just days later against a Syrian air base. France has warned that any further chemicals attacks would be met with a military response.

Russia, a key backer of the Syrian government, last month cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council against renewing the investigation’s mandate.

The inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons and comply with the OPCW in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States, after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in the Damascus suburbs. Western countries blamed that attack on the Syrian government, which denied it.","In message to Russia, Western powers demand U.N. extend Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D820E-OCATP

Addressing supporters at the headquarters of his ZANU-PF party in Harare, 93-year-old Mugabe accused Emmerson Mnangagwa of consulting witchdoctors and prophets as part of a campaign to secure the presidency.

Mnangagwa said he had fled Zimbabwe because of death threats and was safe.

“My sudden departure was caused by incessant threats on my person, life and family by those who have attempted before through various forms of elimination including poisoning,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.

The head of the influential war veterans association, Chris Mutsvangwa, said that Mnangagwa, who was sacked on Monday, would travel to Johannesburg in neighboring South Africa “very soon”.

Mugabe said Mnangagwa, nicknamed “Crocodile”, had made the same mistakes as Joice Mujuru, who was the president’s deputy for 10 years until she was fired in 2014.

“You should not try to say because the journey is long, then I should take a short cut to arrive quickly. The road has lions. There are pitfalls. There is death, beware,” he said.

“...There is no short cut to being the leader of the people. Just as there was no short cut to our independence.”

ZANU-PF would move to discipline Mnangagwa’s “co-conspirators”, Mugabe added.

ZANU-PF’s executive politburo is expected to decide at a meeting on Wednesday whether to fire Mnangagwa and his allies from the party.

Mnangagwa has not been seen in public since his dismissal from government but his ally Mutsvangwa said he was “safe and beyond the reach of the assassins”.

Mutsvangwa ruled out trying to remove Mugabe by force and said war veterans, who had publicly backed Mnangagwa and broke ranks with the president last year, would form a broad front with the opposition in elections next year.

“We don’t want to abuse the military to resolve a political problem. We don’t want them to become the arbiter of political power,” Mutsvangwa said.

He was critical of Mugabe’s wife Grace, who looks set to become vice president after a special ZANU-PF congress in December. “This is a coup by marriage certificate ....and it will be resisted,” he said.",Zimbabwe's Mugabe: Beware of death on road to presidency,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-politics/zimbabwes-mugabe-beware-of-death-on-road-to-presidency-idUSKBN1D8255?il=0

Thick smog swathed Delhi, where pollution readings in some places peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government’s air quality index that measures poisonous particles.

“The air quality in Delhi is deteriorating. We cannot compromise with the health of children at this stage,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, ordering the closure until Sunday.

The Delhi administration, which described the city as a “gas chamber”, had previously ordered schools for young children to close only for Wednesday.

India’s health ministry also advised people with breathing problems and children to remain indoors.

“People should avoid morning walk or any other strenuous outdoor activity that increases breathing rate,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

Anti-pollution measures adopted by the Delhi state government in recent years include limiting car use and taxing trucks that pass through the city, but few have succeeded.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government also urged Delhi and the surrounding northern states to immediately tackle dangerous levels of pollution in the capital, even if that meant deploying helicopters to spray jets of water.

“Every possible step required to tackle the situation has been already identified, and the need of the hour is to put them into action,” Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan wrote on social network Twitter, using the hashtag “#DelhiSmog”.

Vardhan also urged the surrounding states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to ban burning on farms, which is seen as a major contributor to the dirty air, along with high vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites.

EMERGENCY MEASURES

The Delhi government said it had sought meetings with state ministers to discuss the burning, provoking protest from many who saw the measure as being too little and too late.

“Nobody seems to get the gravity of the problem,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, the chairman and managing director of the Medanta Heart Institute.

Last November, the city’s worst pollution in nearly 20 years forced about a million children to miss school, while thousands of workers reported sick and people queued to buy face masks.

Residents are worried this year as well. The Indian Medical Association has urged organisers to call off Delhi’s biggest race set for Nov. 19, to protect runners and volunteers.

If pollution increases, emergency measures, such as the suspension of construction activity, will kick in, the Delhi government has said.

Long-term measures, such as improving public transport and banning the use of dirty industry fuel, are required, said Anumita Roychowdhury of New Delhi’s Centre for Science and Environment.

“Without the systemic changes, the scope and impact of the emergency measures will be limited,” she added.

The thick blanket of smog caused a major vehicle pile-up on a busy highway on the outskirts of Delhi, Indian media reported.

High pollution levels were driving a major surge for air purifiers in capital New Delhi and its suburbs, Amazon.com Inc’s India unit said.

Air purifier sales have surged 150 percent, along with a 260 percent increase in demand for face masks this year, Amazon said, adding that air purifier sales have risen 600 percent in the last month.","Delhi schools shut for rest of week as toxic smog thickens, chokes",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/india-to-step-up-pollution-battle-in-gas-chamber-delhi-idINKBN1D80ZG

Vehicles of every sort already are starting to add wireless chips to download everything from maps to entertainment, and in a few years nearly every new car may be connected. Self-driving cars, still in test mode, will accelerate the move.

“The amount of chips per car is going to grow dramatically,” said Egil Juliussen, a principal analyst for automotive technology at IHSMarkit.

Chip makers are scrambling to create new mobile networks, the so-called fifth generation, which will link phones as well as cars, drones and even industrial devices such as smart street lights, which count pedestrians and send data to city planners.

Qualcomm long was the dominant communications chip maker for mobile phones, although computer chip maker Intel has begun muscling into the space. Each now supplies about half Apple Inc’s iPhone communications chips, for instance.

Now they are jockeying in a mature market to design so-called 5G networks that will be up to 10 times as fast as wireless networks today, which are expected to start rolling out in 2020. Research firm IDC predicts 1.53 billion smart phones will be shipped in 2017 expanding to only 1.77 billion units in 2021.

The market for modem chips for cars, by contrast, is expected to grow sharply. Tristan Gerra, a senior semiconductor analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co, said that this year, only about 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured per year have internet connectivity. But connectivity will become ubiquitous on self-driving cars.

“You basically (will) have 80 million units per year that are going to get a modem,” he said.

Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment.

Qualcomm itself is trying to buy NXP Semiconductors, a maker of automotive chips from so-called “infotainment” system chips to camera systems, for $38 billion. It is unclear whether that deal will go through and whether Broadcom would take on NXP, but Broadcom has said it is willing to do so.

A tie-up between the three companies could create a formidable competitor in the automotive chip space, said IHSMarkit’s Juliussen. He views Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place.

Intel has bought itself into relationships with autonomous car developers thanks to its acquisition of vision system maker Mobileye. Broadcom would get something similar with NXP, Juliussen said.

If Broadcom pulls off both deals, its market position in some areas could be dominant, said Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman.

“[Broadcom] would basically own the majority of the high-end components in the smart phone market and they would have a very significant influence on 5G standards, which are paramount as you think about autonomous vehicles” and connected factories, he said.",Qualcomm buy may pit Broadcom against Intel in 'connected car' fight,https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D81CP-OCATC

Clear agreement on proceeding without the United States would be a boost for the principle of multilateral free trade pacts over the bilateral deal-making that Trump argues will give a better result for American workers.

Japan has been lobbying hard ahead of this week’s meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to get full signoff on an agreement that is also a counterweight to China’s growing regional dominance.

But Canada, whose economy is the second biggest among the TPP-11 after Japan, has joined other countries seeking changes or with misgivings about moving too fast.

“Canada will not be rushed into a deal that is not in the best interest of Canada and of Canadians,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference in Vietnam’s capital Hanoi.

The TPP aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across a bloc whose trade totaled $356 billion last year. It also has provisions for protecting everything from labor rights to the environment to intellectual property - one of the main sticking points.

The original 12 countries had reached agreement on the TPP in 2016, but Trump withdrew in one of his first acts in office - throwing its very survival into doubt.

FRIDAY MEETING

Trump and other APEC leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China and Russian President Vladimir Putin, will meet on Friday in the Vietnamese seaside resort of Danang.

Leaders of the TPP-11, all of which are also APEC members, will break away to consider proposals for proceeding with the trade deal that have been drawn up by their trade negotiators and ministers.

Japan had said it hoped a broad agreement could be reached among the 11 countries in Danang.

“This is not about Friday, it’s about the next decades,” Canada’s trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, told Reuters. “We are constructive, we are even creative at the table. At the same time we want to make sure we get the right deal.”

The positions of both Canada and Mexico are also complicated by the fact that they are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the Trump administration.

Also in doubt is the appetite of New Zealand’s new government to move ahead swiftly. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was too early to say a deal could be reached this week.

“We see a real responsibility to come in and make sure that the agreement is in the best interest of New Zealand,” she said.

Both Malaysia and Vietnam would have been big beneficiaries of the original agreement as a result of the removal of U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, with an election approaching and growing ties to Beijing, has less incentive to move ahead fast.

Among options being discussed by TPP countries is whether to suspend some provisions of the original agreement to avoid having to renegotiate it and potentially to entice the United States back in the long term, officials said.",Canada says won't be rushed on TPP trade deal at Asia-Pacific meeting,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit/canada-says-wont-be-rushed-on-tpp-trade-deal-at-asia-pacific-meeting-idINKBN1D80BH?il=0

>> I'm Andy Sullivan in Washington where Democrats are jubilant after their candidate Ralph Northam trounced Republican Ed Gillespie in a race that was widely seen as a test of President Trump's cloud.

And the preview of the next year's midterm elections when control of Congress will be at stake. Democrats have spent the past year licking their wounds after Trumps surprise 2016 White House victory, now they finally got something to celebrate. Trump wasn't on the ballot but the president loomed large in the race.

Northam, a low key country doctor who currently serves as Lieutenant Governor vowed to stand up to Trump on issues like health care and the environment. Gillespie, a former lobbyist and Republican Party official kept his distance from Trump but echoed many of his racially loaded themes from preserving confederate monuments to cracking down on Hispanic criminal gangs.

A Fifa lançou novos critérios de candidatura após a organização ser fortemente criticada por conta do processo de escolha para as Copas de 2018 e 2002, vencidas pela Rússia e Catar, respectivamente.

Apresentação formal das candidaturas completas precisa ser feita até 16 de março de 2018 e a Fifa irá decidir se irá selecionar uma das candidaturas em seu congresso em junho do ano que vem, ou se irá reabrir o processo caso nenhuma das candidaturas seja aceita.

Sandra, who was already well practised in a circus trick involving a shaving brush, was given a paintbrush and she quickly adapted her skills to the canvas.

Richter said that unlike many elephants in Thailand that are thought to be forced to paint, Sandra does it by herself when she is in the mood.

The committee also denied that any sample tampering had taken place during the Sochi Games and said it had not found evidence of a state-sponsored doping program in the country.

“The arguments of WADA independent expert McLaren on the substitution of positive doping tests with negative ones at the Sochi anti-doping laboratory during the Winter Olympics have been refuted, as well as the existence in Russia of a state doping program for athletes to win a maximum number of medals,” the committee said.

The watchdog said in September it would block Facebook starting next year unless the social network complied with a law requiring websites that store the personal data of Russian citizens to do so on Russian servers.

“In the near future Roskomnadzor will plan a series of supervisory activities aimed at analyzing the activities of the administration of Facebook in terms of the processing of Russian users’ personal information, the terms of services for users, and the content of existing legislation,” it said in a statement on Wednesday carried by the Interfax news agency.

Russian authorities say the law, introduced in 2014, is aimed at protecting Russians’ personal data.

Critics, however, see its use as an attack on social media in a country that has tightened its control over the Internet in recent years.

Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”

“Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit.

Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations.

Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.”

He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.”

The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

“The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region.

‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’

In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance.

While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures.

During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul.

He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed.

The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official.

Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added.

Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday.

Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said.

While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions.

‘GRAVE DANGER’

Slideshow (16 Images)

During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”

However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach.

North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving.

“North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.

He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader.

Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.”

The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said.

A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.

“The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One.

The spending forecast, an increase from 2017 levels and higher than many Wall Street analysts had expected, comes as Conoco, like some peers, focuses more on generating profits than on boosting production at any cost.

Much of that discipline is aided by better technology and more efficient processes that help the company pump more for less. The company expects production to grow 5 percent each year for the rest of the decade.

Executive said they should be able to send more than 30 percent of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks by 2020.

Mugabe sacked his long-time ally Mnangagwa on Monday for showing “traits of disloyalty”, abruptly removing a favorite to succeed the 93-year-old leader and boosting the likelihood of Grace Mugabe becoming his next deputy and potential successor.

State television ZBC said the purge went beyond removing Mnangagwa, 75, as half of the ruling ZANU-PF’s national provincial executives separately met and passed resolutions expelling supporters of the former vice president on Monday.

ZANU-PF leaders in the eastern Manicaland region called for the expulsion of cyber security minister Patrick Chinamasa, a former finance minister before he was moved in a cabinet reshuffle on Oct. 9, ZBC said in an online report.

Chinamasa, fellow cabinet ministers Oppah Muchinguri, Chris Mushohwe and 36 other party members and officials were accused of being Mnangagwa allies who were disrespectful to Mugabe.

“The province recommended the expulsion of 39 individuals from the province who were involved with the Mnangagwa-aligned ‘Lacoste’ faction, which is accused of not respecting the party’s one center of power principle,” ZBC said.

The three cabinet ministers did not respond to calls for comment.

The process to weed out Mnangagwa allies was repeated in four other provinces, the state Herald newspaper said.

A senior ZANU-PF official from Matabeleland South Province told Reuters that the provincial executive there had on Tuesday passed a resolution to fire 15 senior members linked to Mnangagwa, including state security minister Kembo Mohadi.

Remaining provinces were holding separate meetings on Tuesday, two ZANU-PF sources in Harare told Reuters.

Recommendations by the provinces will be discussed by ZANU-PF’s supreme decision-making Politburo at its sitting next week and if adopted will seal the fate of the officials.

International Crisis Group’s southern Africa senior consultant Piers Pigou said purges of ZANU-PF members seen as supportive of Mnangagwa would neutralize any potential fight-back.

“Survival is going to be the name of the game for many people,” he said.

Five ZANU-PF provinces and the youth wing also recommended that Grace become vice president, ZBC said, opening the way for the first lady to serve next to her husband in government.

The approval of the ballot question in Maine comes after Republicans in Washington failed several times over the last few months to pass legislation that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law.

Maine has recently figured prominently in the nation’s debate on how to reform healthcare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal Obamacare this year, which angered President Donald Trump.

Maine, which becomes the first U.S. state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot initiative, according to the Bangor Daily News newspaper.

Tuesday’s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.

The state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, staunchly opposes expansion of federal health care insurance, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions.

“I’ve said it before, ”free“ is very expensive to somebody,” LePage said in a radio address last week.

About 70,000 residents in Maine would be eligible for the state’s Medicaid program when and if state officials certify the results of the election. Lawmakers could vote to repeal or alter the referendum, much like they have recently for several citizen-initiated referendums, the Bangor Daily News reported.

“It is now the responsibility and the duty of the governor and the legislature to fully and faithfully implement this law,” the state’s Speaker of the House, Sara Gideon, said in a statement.

The Legislature’s Office of Fiscal and Program Review in Maine estimated that expansion of Medicaid would cost the state about $55 million and bring in about $525 million of federal money to the state each year, according to the Bangor Daily News.",Voters in Maine approve expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-maine-medicaid/voters-in-maine-approve-expansion-of-medicaid-under-obamacare-idUSKBN1D80G0?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Even as Islamic State is ousted from its strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the extremist group is continuing its battle against authorities in countries like Morocco, Algeria and Egypt.

On Oct. 16, the Egyptian military announced that six soldiers and at least 24 IS militants were killed in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. That same weekend, Moroccan police arrested 11 members of an “extremely dangerous” IS-linked cell and seized chemical products used to make bombs. Algerian forces, meanwhile, have killed at least 71 Islamist fighters so far this year – the most since 2014.

The list of arrests, shootouts and seizure of passports from citizens who want to be foreign fighters goes on. But North African leaders have to navigate a particularly tortuous sectarian path. To avoid the perception that fighting extremism amounts to the persecution of the defenders of the faith, their governments have to be seen to be making visible gestures of Islamic piety – while also cracking down on Shi’ite proselytizing so as to rebut IS claims that authorities are complicit with Iran’s “plots and schemes” to carve up the region and spread Shi’ite Islam.

The Islamist PJD party in Morocco warned recently of a “sectarian Shi’ite invasion;” the Grand Mufti of Mauritania called on his country’s leaders to resist the “rising Shi’ite tide.” One North African government minister I interviewed denounced “the intrusion of Shi’ism through social media, university dormitories, high schools and even qur’anic schools,” concluding gravely, “I ask myself whether the Persians want to dominate the Arab world.”

After Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrein, is North Africa the next realm of a more assertive Iranian foreign policy? These fears come from Iran’s attempt to expand its influence in Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia – and its “backyard:” Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali.

Iran’s foreign minister toured the region in June, meeting with heads of government in Algeria, Mauritania and Tunisia in search of improved ties. Iran may simply be looking for new economic partnerships to offset current sanctions, but its outreach is enough to make some local powers nervous. Around the same time, Iran launched satellites beaming Arabic-language Shi’ite religious programming into North African homes.

There are thought to be fewer than 20,000 Shi’ites in Algeria, and the government recently mandated the registration of all of them. The Algerian minister of religious affairs has said that Shi’ites have no right to spread their faith in Algeria, “because that causes sedition and other problems.” ""Algeria cannot play host to a sectarian war that does not concern it,” he explained in an interview. “Neither Shi'ism, nor Wahhabism nor any of the other sects are the product of Algerians, nor do they come from Algeria. We refuse to be the battleground for two external and foreign ideologies.” Diplomatic relations resist easy categories, however. Algeria is one of only a handful of countries, along with Iran, to maintain good relations with Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are Shi’ite. Algiers was Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s first stop in North Africa in June.

Given the tiny number of Shi’ites living in North Africa and the tight control over mosques in the region, widespread Shi’ite religious influence on the ground is unrealistic. Whether or not the scale of proselytism justifies the level of concern, Moroccan and Algerian leaders view Iran’s Africa policy as a threat to their domestic order and regional security. The prospect of sectarian strife exists for “heterodox” – i.e. non-Sunni – minorities scattered across the region, numbering in the millions who live under mainstream Sunni rule. Some of these groups are offshoots of Shi’ite Islam, but are not necessarily the source of conflict. In Algeria, their mere difference – and the government’s toleration of them – sometimes provokes attack from local hardliners.

North Africa’s Sunni governments struggle with the reality that two adversaries – Iran and IS – are the net beneficiaries of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the crushing of Sunni opposition in Syria in 2017. The decline of Saudi influence after the Sept. 11 attacks and the downfall of Sunni Baathist rule in Iraq enhanced Iran’s stature while diminishing Sunni Arab influence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria – and opening a path for IS.

Officially, there is no Shi’ite minority in Morocco; unofficial estimates put the number at less than 2 percent. Nonetheless, the foreign ministry in Rabat has accused Iran of trying to alter “the kingdom’s religious fundamentals.” The bad blood is the legacy of a sour relationship between Ayatollah Khomenei and King Hassan II (the father of current Moroccan King Mohammed VI) in the 1980s. The Ayatollah’s claims of Islamic supremacy over all Muslims threatened the Moroccan King’s role as “Emir al Mouamine” – leader of the faithful – of scores of millions of followers across Northwest Africa. Hassan chaired the international council of Islamic scholars that declared the Ayatollah to be an apostate – “if he is Muslim, then I’m not” – and openly supported Iraq in its war with Iran.

In turn, Hassan thought he saw an Iranian hand behind his domestic travails. Tehran provided safe haven to the Moroccan armed opposition group Chabiba Islamiya, and Hassan publicly accused Iran of fomenting riots against rising living costs and the violent uprising in the northern Rif region that is home to many Berbers. Street contestation in the Rif region has again put Rabat off balance in 2017 and revived the accusations a generation later.

The contrast with neighboring Tunisia is significant. Tunis has enjoyed unbroken relations with Iran since 1990, including high-level exchanges before and after the January, 2011 revolution that sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Trade with Iran increased significantly as a result, but hardly registered compared to much more significant trade with the EU, North Africa, China and Turkey. Tunisia prides itself on being an island of sectarian tolerance in a rapidly polarizing region. Senior religious affairs officials proudly state that they represent all religions, including Christians and Jews, although in reality the country has very few non-Sunni Muslims. After the January 15 revolution, Tunisia signed the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and helped protect religious freedom in Article 6 of its new constitution.

Saudi Arabia has maintained its natural advantage, however. A month after the Iranian foreign minister left Tunis, a Saudi government delegation arrived, including 53 businessmen. They signed agreements with the government worth $200 million in development projects, including several hospitals and the renovations of a historic mosque in Kairouan.

But not all countries in North Africa feel they have that freedom when they perceive a two-front ideological battle against IS and Iran. In response to the State Department’s admonishments on religious freedoms in Algeria, the Algerian Minister said: “If they want to accuse us of defending Islam and our historic traditions, then let them.”

The defeat of IS in Raqqa has bought time for North African governments to consolidate their religious communities. But that same defeat also removes an obstacle to Iranian influence – not unlike the fall of Baghdad almost 15 years ago. Don’t expect the competition for leadership from the Persian Gulf to be resolved anytime soon.","Commentary: In Sunni North Africa, fears of Iran’s Shi’ite shadow",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-commentary-laurence-afterislamicstate/commentary-in-sunni-north-africa-fears-of-irans-shiite-shadow-idUSKBN1CV376

Home borrowing costs fell in step with bond yields in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s nomination last week of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to head the U.S. central bank. Powell, if confirmed, would succeed current chair Janet Yellen whose term expires in February.

Powell is seen as someone who would continue the Fed’s current approach to gradually raising interest rates and shrinking the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

Bond yields had spiked in October partly on worries Trump would select a candidate such as Stanford University economist John Taylor who is perceived to hold a hawkish view on monetary policy.

Benchmark yields have also retreated from their seven-month high after an October payrolls report that showed wage growth stalled and due to uncertainty over a Republican-sponsored bill aimed at overhauling the federal tax code.

Islamic State has been all but destroyed over the past two years, remaining only in Albu Kamal in Syria, Rawa in Iraq, in a few neighboring villages and patches of desert, and some isolated pockets elsewhere.

At the height of its power in 2015, it ruled over an expanse of the two countries, eradicating their border, printing money, imposing draconian laws and plotting attacks across the world.

On Wednesday, the army and its allies surrounded Albu Kamal and started to enter it, the pro-Hezbollah al-Manar television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, reported that Iraqi militias had crossed into Syria to join the assault, but they denied it.

Despite its losses, Islamic State still has a territorial presence in Libya and elsewhere, and many governments expect it to remain a threat even after it loses the caliphate it declared from Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.

It has already carried out a series of guerrilla operations in both Iraq and in Syria, and it has continued to inspire lone militants to attack civilian targets in the West.

In Syria, the end of major battle operations against Islamic State may only prefigure a new phase of the war, as the rival forces which have seized territory from the jihadists square off.

The Syrian army, alongside its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias, and backed by Iran and Russia, have seized swathes of central and eastern Syria in an advance against Islamic State this year.

Russian official media have in recent weeks reported a surge of strategic bombing and cruise missile strikes on Islamic State targets in eastern Syria as the army advanced.

A U.S.-backed coalition has supported a rival campaign in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that have pushed Islamic State from much of the country’s north and east.

NEW PHASE

The Syrian government has sworn to recapture territory held by the SDF, including Islamic State’s former capital Raqqa and oil and gas fields lying east of the Euphrates.

In areas controlled by the SDF in northern Syria, Kurdish-led groups have established autonomy, announcing elections and setting internal policies.

On Tuesday, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, described the U.S. forces aiding the SDF in Syria as illegal invaders. Washington has not spelled out how its military support for the SDF would evolve after Islamic State’s defeat.

Shaaban also pointed, in a television interview, to the example of Iraq, where the government retaliated against an autonomous Kurdish region after it held an independence referendum.

Iraqi military officials say small groups of Islamic State militants are still entrenched in the town of Rawa and the border desert strip with Syria. Scattered villages near al-Qaim, close to Albu Kamal, are still under militant control in an area called Rummana.

The Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an alliance of militias, denied a report by the Observatory that it had crossed the Syrian border and was attacking Albu Kamal.

“Our movements are carried out under orders from the commander in chief of the armed forces and our key objective is to liberate Iraq’s territories from Daesh. We have no orders to cross the borders,” PMF spokesman Ahmed al-Asadi said.",Syrian army starts assault on last IS stronghold,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-islamic-state/syrian-army-starts-assault-on-last-is-stronghold-idINKBN1D81NG

Jacinda Ardern, the charismatic new leader of New Zealand, announced the death of the Prime Moggy on Wednesday after Paddles was hit by a car the previous evening, prompting an outpouring of grief on social media.

Paddles’ rise to social media fame matched her 37-year-old owner’s meteoric ascent to the prime ministership after only taking over as leader of her Labour Party in August.

A “First Cat of NZ” Twitter account was set up by an anonymous user last month, featuring regular tweets about the photogenic cat’s famous “mummy”, Ardern, and quickly attracted 11,000 followers.

People from around the world posted messages such as “rest in peace” and “gone too soon” with the hashtag “#paddles”.

Paddles the polydactyl cat’s feats included being able to hold a pair of glasses with her opposable thumb and she featured regularly in photos of Ardern at work.

“To anyone who has ever lost a pet, you’ll know how sad we feel. Paddles was much loved, and not just by us. Thanks for everyone’s thoughts,” Ardern wrote on Facebook.

Ardern’s rise to power has generated intense interest in her personal life and drew comparisons with other youthful trailblazers such as France’s Emmanuel Macron and Canada’s Justin Trudeau.

And, according to Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford, Paddles often played her part in affairs of state, even interrupting the premier’s first call with U.S. President Donald Trump in October.

“As the call was transferred our cat (yes that bloody cat) came flying through the cat-flap,” Gayford, a television presenter, wrote in a column for the Spinoff news website.

“She leapt up onto the chair next to Jacinda and began announcing her very squawky arrival,” he wrote.","New Zealand's Prime Moggy, Paddles the six-toed cat, meets an untimely end",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-politics-cat/new-zealands-prime-moggy-paddles-the-six-toed-cat-meets-an-untimely-end-idINKBN1D808F

Shaun Bridges, 35, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco after pleading guilty in August to money laundering in the second criminal case to be brought against the former agent, prosecutors said.

Bridges, who served in the Secret Service’s Baltimore field office, was sentenced in 2015 to 71 months in prison for diverting to his personal account over $800,000 worth of bitcoins during the Silk Road probe.

Before serving that sentence, though, Bridges was arrested again on new charges related to his theft of bitcoins that were at the time worth $359,005 but today are valued at $11.3 million, according to the industry publication CoinDesk.

A lawyer for Bridges declined to comment.

Silk Road operated for more than two years until it was shut down in October 2013, generating more than $214 million in sales of drugs and other illicit goods using bitcoins, prosecutors said.

Ross Ulbricht, who authorities say ran Silk Road under the alias “Dread Pirate Roberts,” was sentenced in 2015 to life in prison after a federal jury in New York found him guilty of charges including distributing drugs through the internet.

Bridges was initially arrested in March 2015 along with another member of the Baltimore-based federal task force that investigated Silk Road, former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Force.

Force later pleaded guilty to charges of extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice for stealing bitcoins during the probe and for secretly soliciting payment from Ulbricht. He was sentenced in 2015 to 6-1/2 years in prison.

Prosecutors said the bitcoins at issue in the latest case against Bridges had been seized in 2014 from a digital currency exchange.

Prosecutors said that after signing a plea deal in the 2015 case, Bridges used his access to a so-called digital wallet containing the bitcoins that the government controlled to transfer the bitcoins to digital wallets he controlled.",Ex-agent in Silk Road probe gets more prison time for bitcoin theft,https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-silkroad/ex-agent-in-silk-road-probe-gets-more-prison-time-for-bitcoin-theft-idINKBN1D804Z

It will release a fuller revised analysis conducted with the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation later on Wednesday that will also estimate the impact on health insurance coverage and premiums.

The details of the stake, revealed by Snapchat after badly received quarterly results, came as U.S. and Chinese firms announced $9 billion in new deals on the arrival of President Donald Trump in Beijing.

It helped the U.S. company recoup a slide of almost 20 percent in pre-trading in New York after it reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations.

Snap shares recovered to trade down 12 percent at $13.29 in premarket trading from a close of $15.12 on Tuesday.

Snap’s largely privately owned structure, which reserves 95 percent of voting rights for its co-founders, made it likely Tencent was just accumulating a financial stake.

“While such news may be initially perceived as positive by the market, one has to remember that Tencent’s holdings in Snap is the non-voting Class A shares, which makes a possible acquisition of Snap by Tencent less likely,” said Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.

Along with Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent has poured billions of cash from a decade of growth in China into buying U.S. firms and holds 5 percent of electric car maker Tesla, as well as stakes in ride service company Lyft and augmented reality startup Magic Leap.

The largest social media and gaming company in China and owner of the popular mobile application WeChat, it had previously invested in Snap through an affiliate in 2013, and has been referred as a “role model” by Snap’s co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel.

Snap said in its quarterly report that Tencent had bought 145.8 million shares of its non-voting Class A common stock on the open market. Snap had about 1.2 billion shares outstanding, as of Oct 31.(bit.ly/2zqvybE)

“The positive side of this could be that the two companies may create business partnership of some kind or Tencent may aid Snap in expanding its reach into China,” Morningstar’s Mogharabi said.

Unlike many U.S. stock market-listed corporations, Snap is not obligated to disclose changes in Tencent’s ownership of Snap’s Class A stock. Snap said it had only received the details of the stake from Tencent this month and declined to answer further questions on the filing.

Snap, on Tuesday, reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations, as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s Instagram. The company has disappointed investors each quarter since it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March.

Snap’s daily active users (DAU) stood at 178 million, below expectation of 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

Dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have been detained in the crackdown and are facing allegations of money laundering, bribery, extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain.

Commercial bankers told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that Saudi banks had frozen more than 1,200 accounts on the central bank’s instructions and that the number was continuing to rise almost hourly.

This has raised fears among businessmen that payments of outstanding debts could be delayed and that day-to-day activities of some companies, such as paying staff and creditors, might be hindered.

The share prices of some companies linked to detained tycoons have plunged about 20 percent in the past three days.

Protesters shut down roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, and some public transport ran minimum services in response to calls for action by two civic groups -- whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- and a labour union.

People stood across dozens of major highways in the region waving placards and chanting “freedom for political prisoners”, TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters.

While many smaller stores left their shutters closed, most larger shops and businesses in the region appeared to be open as normal.

An uphill task awaited the political heavyweights of the independence campaign, whose parties jointly ran Catalonia for the last two years until Madrid sacked the region’s government in response to its independence push.

Deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont’s centre-right PDeCAT and the leftist ERC of former regional vice president Oriol Junqueras had until midnight on Tuesday to agree a new pact, but they failed to meet that deadline, meaning they will contest the Dec. 21 vote as separate parties.

The central government in Madrid called the election last month after assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament’s unilateral independence declaration.

Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, while Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds.

‘JUNCKER WON‘T MEET ME’

Puigdemont, who faces the same charges and is the subject of a extradition request from Madrid, had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union.

But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc’s executive.

Protesters hold banners reading ""Freedom Political Prisoners, We are Republic"" as they gather in Sant Jaume square at a demonstration during a partial regional strike in Barcelona, Spain, November 8, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea

“(EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn’t want to meet me,” Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard.

“I’ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now, are wrecking Europe ... The gap between the Europe of the people and the official Europe is increasing.”

Catalonia’s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, triggered a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the country’s civil war in the 1930s.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month’s election would usher in “a period of calm” and business as usual for the region.

“I‘m hoping for massive participation in the election.. and, after that, we’ll return to normality,” he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday.

An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras’ ERC could garner between 45 and 46 seats in Catalonia’s 135-strong regional assembly while Puigdemont’s PdeCat would win just 14 or 15.

In order to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority, they would then have to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP.

ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a banking conference in Madrid he hoped the election would revive the Catalan success story “during which it has enjoyed great economic and cultural prosperity together with a high level of self-governance.”

For some Catalans who ignored Wednesday’s strike -- called by the CSC union and supported by civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural -- that moment is already overdue.

“Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary. In this world we have to work and not argue so much,” Jose Luis, a construction worker, told Reuters TV as he walked through Barcelona on his way to work.

“The politicians should work more and stop their silliness.”",Catalan strike severs road links as secessionist leaders regroup,https://in.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia/catalan-strike-severs-road-links-as-secessionist-leaders-regroup-idINKBN1D81HD

Weakened by losing her party’s majority in a June election, May faces another crisis after her defense minister resigned in a sexual harassment scandal, leaving the government with “the stench of death” to it, according to an opposition lawmaker.

Patel, a Brexit campaigner who is popular in the governing Conservative Party, was heading back to London after cancelling meetings on a planned trip to Africa to respond to media reports that she failed to declare meetings with Israeli officials in a breach of diplomatic protocol.

Asked whether Patel should be dismissed, the new defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, told reporters in Brussels: “The prime minister makes her own decision on actually who is serving in her cabinet, and they’re only the prime minister’s decisions.”

Under British protocol, a cabinet minister would normally organize meetings through the foreign office and be accompanied by officials, and visits with Israelis would typically be balanced with meetings with Palestinians. Patel was also reported to have visited the Golan Heights, territory disputed between Israel and Syria, which British officials tend to avoid.

Whether Patel is sacked or not, the scandal is the latest to rattle May, who is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party in parliament to make laws - increasingly important as Britain navigates its departure from the European Union.

She lost close ally Michael Fallon, her defense secretary, last week, and her deputy Damian Green and another minister are under investigation as part of the sexual harassment scandal in parliament.

On Tuesday, her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was pressed to apologize over remarks he made about a jailed aid worker in Iran, which critics said could prompt Tehran to hand her a longer jail term.

Opposition lawmakers are openly questioning whether May has the strength to continue as prime minister.

“There are times when a government has the stench of death about it,” Pat McFadden, a lawmaker from the main opposition Labour Party, told parliament on Tuesday.

Patel apologized to May on Monday for failing to report that she had met senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a holiday.

On Wednesday, the Sun newspaper reported that she had also failed to disclose that she had met the director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Yuval Rotem, in New York and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan in London.

A government source confirmed those meetings took place.

The source said that no UK government officials were present for the discussions, and they were set up and reported in a way that did not accord with the usual procedures.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper also reported that Patel visited a field hospital of the Israeli Defence Forces in the Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war.

A spokesman for May denied that the prime minister had been aware of Patel’s meeting with Netanyahu in advance.

The approval of the ballot question in Maine comes after Republicans in Washington failed several times over the last few months to pass legislation that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law.

Maine has recently figured prominently in the nation’s debate on how to reform healthcare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal Obamacare this year, which angered President Donald Trump.

Maine, which becomes the first U.S. state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot initiative, according to the Bangor Daily News newspaper.

Tuesday’s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.

The state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, staunchly opposes expansion of federal health care insurance, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions.

“I’ve said it before, ”free“ is very expensive to somebody,” LePage said in a radio address last week.

About 70,000 residents in Maine would be eligible for the state’s Medicaid program when and if state officials certify the results of the election. Lawmakers could vote to repeal or alter the referendum, much like they have recently for several citizen-initiated referendums, the Bangor Daily News reported.

“It is now the responsibility and the duty of the governor and the legislature to fully and faithfully implement this law,” the state’s Speaker of the House, Sara Gideon, said in a statement.

The Legislature’s Office of Fiscal and Program Review in Maine estimated that expansion of Medicaid would cost the state about $55 million and bring in about $525 million of federal money to the state each year, according to the Bangor Daily News.",Voters in Maine approve expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-maine-medicaid/voters-in-maine-approve-expansion-of-medicaid-under-obamacare-idUSKBN1D80G0

President Nicolas Maduro said last week that the bond would be paid in full, but added that all future sovereign and PDVSA debt payments would be restructured and refinanced.

Although Maduro said future debt would be honored, investors nonetheless interpreted his comments as an indication his government was preparing to default.

PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has broken the 2017N payment into separate portions, the sources said, asking not to be identified.

They added that it was not immediately evident when bondholders would receive the funds or which bank was the recipient bank for the funds.

PDVSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The full payment of $1.169 billion, which includes $1.121 billion in principal and $47 million in interest, was due on Nov. 2. Since October, Venezuela and PDVSA have been skipping interest payments, invoking a 30-day grace period in an apparent effort to ease a cash crunch that has left the country desperately short of basic goods such as food and medicines.

The 45-year-old farmer was one of more than a million South Sudanese living in sprawling camps just across the border in northern Uganda, seeking refuge from the four-year war that has devastated their homeland.

But funding gaps and organizational problems often delay or reduce their meager rations, driving some desperate families back to the lands they fled and underscoring the struggle to cope with Africa’s biggest refugee crisis in two decades.

Refugees from South Sudan have been arriving in Uganda at an average rate of 35,000 a month this year. The Bidi Bidi camp was home to 285,000 people at the end of September, according to the U.N.’s refugee agency, making it the biggest in Africa.

The U.N. agency (UNHCR) said funding had only covered 32 percent of $674 million requested to help refugees in Uganda in 2017 and the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) said it was facing a $71 million shortfall for the next six months.

Wani, who cared for his elderly parents, received no food in October because distributions had been delayed, his father Timon said. The memory of the crops Oliver had left behind proved too tempting and he returned to South Sudan to find food.

Two weeks later, other returning refugees recognized his remains alongside another dead refugee on a forest path in South Sudan, where the ground was littered with bullet casings.

“He went back to look for food,” said Timon, a tall, thin man who wiped away tears with his handkerchief as he spoke at a memorial service for his first-born child in the Palorinya refugee camp. “I‘m heartbroken.”

DESPERATE REFUGEES

The four-year war in oil-rich South Sudan, a country only founded in 2011, has forced more than a third of its 12 million citizens to flee their homes. Tens of thousands have died, some in ethnic killings, others from starvation and disease.

Palorinya is the second biggest camp in northern Uganda after Bidi Bidi and alone houses 185,000 refugees.

Each refugee is supposed to get 12 kg of grain, 6 kg of dry beans, cooking oil and salt each month, but the U.N.’s WFP said this was delayed in October because grain was scarce in Uganda and the roads to Palorinya were bad.

Food distributions did not start camp until Oct. 26, WFP said. It takes two weeks to complete a distribution, so tens of thousands of refugees did not get any food that month.

Desperate, some returned to the war zone. At least eight refugees from Palorinya were killed in South Sudan after returning to look for food in October, according to family members and the Anglican church, which tracks civilian deaths.

In August and September, when rations were distributed normally, just two refugees from the camp were killed when they returned to find food, the church diocese in South Sudan’s volatile Kajo Keji region said.

Modi Scopas John, chairman of a Refugee Welfare Committee in Palorinya, said refugees were returning home every day.

“If you have nothing to eat, what do you do?” he asked, perched on a plastic chair under a spindly tree. “You have to look for food.”

FOOD SHORTAGES

Wani was killed in Kajo Keji, where the government and two rebel groups are battling for control in a war sparked by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar.

Next to Wani lay the body of Yassin Mori, 35, who had also left Palorinya to look for food, according to Mori’s two brothers who ventured into South Sudan to look for him.

Mori left two wives and nine children behind.

“Now we need support because we are left with his children and widows,” Taha Igga, one of the brothers, said at a memorial service in the Ugandan refugee camp.

Mutabazi Caleb, from aid group World Vision, which runs the distributions, said that Palorinya is two months behind other camps in its food distributions.

WFP said it had substituted half the cereal ration with money in September in some other camps so refugees could buy food and was expanding its infrastructure to prevent future delays.

But refugees said even when food arrives, it doesn’t last a month. Of the 12 kg of grain, refugees said they sell one to pay for grinding the rest into flour, and another to buy soap, which is in short supply.

They also complained that the beans were sometimes inedible.

“They are not okay, others are rotten, and they are smelling,” said mother-of-four Liong Viola, 32, picking through her sack of shriveled legumes during an Oct. 26 distribution.

WFP country director El Khidir Daloum said it was investigating the complaint and, “is committed to providing our beneficiaries with the highest quality of food”.

John, the Refugee Welfare Committee chairman, said he urged people to stay in the camps.

“At least let us die here of the hunger rather than go back to South Sudan and be killed like a chicken,” he said.

But hungry refugees often ignore the pleas. At dusk last Saturday, Pastor Charles Mubarak packed extra clothes into a plastic bag to take back into South Sudan where he hoped to harvest cassava fields he left behind when he fled in January.

“As a family, we are 10 in number, and I‘m not in position to feed them,” he said. “If I get killed I get killed once, but dying of hunger is too difficult.”

Mubarak kissed each neatly folded shirt as he placed them in the bag.

“If they give us the food rations, I wouldn’t think of going back to South Sudan,” he said. “Food is life.”",Hungry South Sudanese refugees risk death in return home for food,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D81TK-OZATP

Ahead of the election, some market strategists found it difficult to plan financially for Trump’s possible presidency, in part because many of his proposals were seen as contradictory or lacking in detail.

However, at the close of trading of that session, Dow futures had reversed the drop to close up nearly 250 points, above 18,500.

That is the lowest they have been since then.

Despite not having a single major legislative victory and with prospects for a government shutdown in December looming, stocks have not looked back in the Trump era.

The S&P 500 .SPX is up 21.1 percent since the 2016 election, while the Dow .DJI has gained 28.5 percent in that period and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC is up 30.3 percent.

Banks and technology have been the best performers over the past year, with telecommunication services the weakest performer.

The Dow has closed at a record high more than 70 times since election day 2016 and the S&P 500 has closed at a record on 52 days in 2017 -the fifth-most in any year, but it could challenge the 59 record closes in 1928 for third place or the 62 in 1964 for second, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The year with the most S&P record closing highs is 1995 with 77. There were 53 in 2014.

Economic growth across the globe, alongside stimulative monetary policy from the world's largest central banks, have been behind the market's rally. The expectation of pro-growth and business-friendly policies from the Trump administration as well as bets on deregulation, gave investors further reasons to invest in stocks.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday Moscow opposed a draft U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of the investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Ryabkov’s comments came hours after Russia rejected a report by the international inquiry blaming the Syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack on April 4.

In a joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the United States, the four countries said they had full confidence in the findings and called on the Syrian regime to end all use of poison gas and finally declare to the OPCW all the chemical weapons it possesses.

“We therefore urge the United Nations Security Council to maintain the investigative capacity” of the inquiry, the statement said.

“After such a report, the Security Council and all its members have a common responsibility to protect the international non-proliferation regime and to respect their previous commitments,” the joint statement said.

The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The April 4 attack prompted a U.S. missile strike just days later against a Syrian air base. France has warned that any further chemicals attacks would be met with a military response.

Russia, a key backer of the Syrian government, last month cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council against renewing the investigation’s mandate.

>> The man who killed 26 people at a church in Texas, Sunday, escaped from a mental health facility in 2012, according to a police report. The person who reported Devin Kelley's escape warned the police that he could be a danger to himself and others. And had been caught sneaking weapons into Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where he had been stationed.

According to a police report, Kelley was also convicted by a U.S. Air force court-martial for assaulting his first wife and stepson, while serving in the air force that same year. Despite all this, Kelley was still able to buy the semi-automatic weapon he used to carry out the deadliest shooting, by a lone gun man, in Texas history.

Why? Because the Air Force failed to add his conviction to its records. Firearms expert said, the case involving Kelley was spent a year in military detention before his bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014, has exposed a previously unnoticed weak link on the system of background checks.

Now, authorities are looking for a motive and reaching a few dead ends.

Clear agreement on proceeding without the United States would be a boost for the principle of multilateral free trade pacts over the bilateral deal-making that Trump argues will give a better result for American workers.

Japan has been lobbying hard ahead of this week’s meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to get full signoff on an agreement that is also a counterweight to China’s growing regional dominance.

But Canada, whose economy is the second biggest among the TPP-11 after Japan, has joined other countries seeking changes or with misgivings about moving too fast.

“Canada will not be rushed into a deal that is not in the best interest of Canada and of Canadians,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference in Vietnam’s capital Hanoi.

The TPP aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across a bloc whose trade totaled $356 billion last year. It also has provisions for protecting everything from labor rights to the environment to intellectual property - one of the main sticking points.

The original 12 countries had reached agreement on the TPP in 2016, but Trump withdrew in one of his first acts in office - throwing its very survival into doubt.

FRIDAY MEETING

Trump and other APEC leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China and Russian President Vladimir Putin, will meet on Friday in the Vietnamese seaside resort of Danang.

Leaders of the TPP-11, all of which are also APEC members, will break away to consider proposals for proceeding with the trade deal that have been drawn up by their trade negotiators and ministers.

Japan had said it hoped a broad agreement could be reached among the 11 countries in Danang.

“This is not about Friday, it’s about the next decades,” Canada’s trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, told Reuters. “We are constructive, we are even creative at the table. At the same time we want to make sure we get the right deal.”

The positions of both Canada and Mexico are also complicated by the fact that they are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the Trump administration.

Also in doubt is the appetite of New Zealand’s new government to move ahead swiftly. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was too early to say a deal could be reached this week.

“We see a real responsibility to come in and make sure that the agreement is in the best interest of New Zealand,” she said.

Both Malaysia and Vietnam would have been big beneficiaries of the original agreement as a result of the removal of U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, with an election approaching and growing ties to Beijing, has less incentive to move ahead fast.

Among options being discussed by TPP countries is whether to suspend some provisions of the original agreement to avoid having to renegotiate it and potentially to entice the United States back in the long term, officials said.",Canada says won't be rushed on TPP trade deal at Asia-Pacific meeting,https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D80BH-OCABS

FILE PHOTO - EpiPen auto-injection epinephrine pens manufactured by Mylan NV pharmaceutical company for use by severe allergy sufferers are seen in Washington, U.S. on August 24, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo

But a non-pharmaceutical offering – refined coal – has quietly generated hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits for the company over the last six years that have boosted its bottom line, according to a Reuters review of company filings.

Since 2011, Mylan has bought 99 percent stakes in five companies across the U.S. that own plants which process coal to reduce smog-causing emissions. It then sells the coal at a loss to power plants to generate the real benefit for the drug company: credits that allow Mylan to lower its own tax bill.

Infographic ID: '2sQaEQL'

These refined coal credits were approved by Congress in 2004 in order to incentivize companies to fund production of cleaner coal. They are available to any company that is willing to invest the capital, and are set to expire after 2021.

Mylan is one of only a few public companies, and the only publicly-traded pharmaceutical maker, that uses these tax credits, a Reuters review of a comprehensive database of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found. It is possible other companies receive an immaterial amount of the tax credits and decline to disclose them.

Future tax credits could prove valuable to Mylan, which has seen sales of its flagship EpiPen allergy treatment sag after consumer outrage over the allergy treatment’s $600 list price. The pricing issue, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice, and Chairman Robert Coury’s nearly $100 million pay package last year have caused a group of investors to launch an effort to vote down the company’s board at its annual meeting on Thursday.

Mylan already carries a low tax rate after moving its headquarters overseas in 2015. The coal credits helped the company lower its effective tax rate further, to just over four percent in 2014 and 7.4 percent in 2015. Last year, the company actually had a tax benefit of $358 million, giving it an effective tax rate of negative 294 percent.

Mylan confirmed Reuters’ calculations based on figures in the tax footnotes in the company’s annual reports. According to these calculations, Mylan used more than $100 million of “clean energy and research” tax credits in both 2016 and 2015, and around $95 million in 2014.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters these coal operations have increased Mylan’s net earnings by around $40 million to $50 million in each of the past two years. That accounts for around 9 percent of the company’s earnings last year and more than 5 percent of its 2015 earnings.

Mylan has disclosed very little about the tax credit strategy or its coal refining operations. It did not announce the coal deals when they occurred or disclose how much they cost. Mylan has not discussed them on its earnings conference calls and does not disclose exactly how much in tax credits they generate or what effect they are having on its bottom line.

Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who has a market perform rating on the company, said he believes that, from an investor standpoint, the coal transactions adds unnecessary complexity.

“The average investor looking at their financial statements or their press releases, would have no idea what this is or how it flows through to their profit and loss statement,” he said.

“BEING MINDFUL OF TAX PLANNING”

Mylan refers to losses and interest expense generated by its “clean energy investments,” as well as the fact that they qualify for tax credits, in tables and footnotes at the bottom of its earnings releases. In filings with regulators, it discloses some risks around the investments, their carrying value, and liabilities related to the investments.

“It does sound like they are being mindful of tax planning,” said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “From the perspective of shareholder value, companies have all of the incentive in the world to try to reduce their tax payments, to increase net income and increase distributions to shareholders.”

Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an emailed statement that the tax credits are available to any interested company, and often “made outside of a company’s ordinary course of business, and companies involved in such projects range across a variety of non-energy related sectors.”

Other companies Reuters found that take the credits include insurance brokerage and risk management services firm Arthur J Gallagher, Waste Management Inc and industrial supply company WW Grainger. The companies vary in their level of disclosure of the investments, but some disclose the number of tax credits they receive from the facilities.

Devlin added that the health company recognizes that the production at the refined coal facilities will no longer be eligible for a tax credit beginning in 2022. “Nonetheless, on an ongoing basis, we consider appropriate opportunities for tax planning with respect to our global operations,” she added.

New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer spoke out against the tax strategy when informed about it by Reuters. Stringer, who is leading the effort to vote down Mylan’s current board, oversees New York City pensions that together own more than 1.1 million shares of Mylan stock.

“From the EpiPen pricing debacle to embracing complex tax avoidance strategies, Mylan’s board appears more focused on financial engineering than on the company’s core business,” he said.

COAL INTEREST DATES TO 2011

Mylan made the first investment in the coal producing plants in 2011, and expanded its total holdings to 5 plants by 2014.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who has led the company since 2012, has coal country roots: she is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the second largest coal-producing state in the country. The company declined to discuss the origin of why it adopted the tax strategy.

Mylan says in its last two annual reports that its holdings are equity method investments in five limited liability corporations that own refined coal production plants, but does not name them.

Reuters was able to identify these operations by reviewing lists of the company’s subsidiaries included with its annual reports. Mylan has 99 percent stakes in 5 LLCs that own refined coal plants: Canton Fuels Company in Illinois, Chouteau Fuels Company in Oklahoma, Deogun Manufacturing Company in Utah, Marquis Industrial Company in Indiana and Powder Street LLC in West Virginia.

Mylan is booking losses from the plants, which is not unusual for these facilities. The companies often pay a middleman who manages the coal production facilities as well as other costs.

Mylan recorded pre-tax losses of $92.3 million in 2016, $93.2 million in 2015 and $78.9 million in 2014 from the operations. The loss generated by the coal plants, as well as depreciation, is tax deductible, according to tax experts.

But the tax credits generated by the facilities are extremely valuable. Last year, companies received $6.81 in tax credits for every ton of refined coal produced. Mylan produced around 16 million tons of refined coal last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

According to the same person, expenses – including costs paid for the assets and adjusted for tax deductions – equate to around 60 percent of the gross credits earned.",Drugmaker Mylan gets boost from unlikely source: coal,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-coal-insight/drugmaker-mylan-gets-boost-from-unlikely-source-coal-idUSKBN19C0DW

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.
“Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.","BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.

Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.

Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.

“Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”

Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.

Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.

BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.

Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.

Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.

Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.

“HOPE AND PROMISE”

The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.

Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.

That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.

“It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”

And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.

Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.

He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.

With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.

BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.

Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.

“It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”

BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.

On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.

AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.

The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.

The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.

Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.

Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.

Last year’s Panama Papers helped to topple elected leaders. Now an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists into 13.4 million financial statements, emails, loan agreements and other paperwork has uncovered politicians, financiers and companies using secrecy to hide transactions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had an investment in a shipping firm with significant ties to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ICIJ says. Even Queen Elizabeth invested through offshore companies.

There can be legitimate reasons for wanting to hide business interests offshore, especially for those living in turbulent countries. But getting away from tax and law-enforcement authorities is getting more complicated, and therefore dearer.

More than 100 jurisdictions – including several offshore financial centres – have committed to automatically exchange tax information with foreign governments. About 50 started sharing data in September, making it harder for individuals and companies to hide their financial dealings. Meanwhile, countries including Britain and Sweden have passed legislation that forces foreign companies and legal entities operating within their borders to disclose their ultimate owner – bypassing the often complex chain of offshore vehicles and trusts. Others, including the United States, are also introducing or tightening beneficial ownership rules.

Regulation will not stop the global flow of illicit money. Loopholes can always be found, and there are enough dark spots on the planet.

Matt Streb, 36, was one of 1,200 workers laid off on Jan. 20 - inauguration day for Republican U.S. President Donald Trump - when GM canceled the third shift at its Lordstown small-car factory here. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, the only vehicle the plant makes, have nosedived as U.S. consumers switch to SUVs and pickup trucks.

Streb is looking for another job, but employers are wary because they assume he will quit whenever GM calls him back.

“I get it,” said Streb, who has a degree in communications, “but it’s frustrating.”

Layoffs at Lordstown and other auto plants point to a broader challenge for the economy in Midwestern manufacturing states and for the Trump administration.

The U.S. auto industry's boom from 2010 through last year was a major driver for manufacturing job creation. The fading of that boom threatens prospects for U.S. industrial output and job creation that were central to President Trump's victory in Ohio and other manufacturing states.

Infographic ID: '2smL7NQ'

“This is about economics, not what Trump says,” said Robert Morales, president of United Auto Workers (UAW) union Local 1714, which represents workers at GM’s stamping plant at Lordstown. “Even if Trump went out and bought 10,000 Cruzes a month, he wouldn’t get the third shift back here.”

Last week the Federal Reserve said U.S. factory output fell 0.4 percent in May, the second decline in three months, due partly to a 2-percent drop in motor vehicles and parts production.

Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has compiled data from government sources that show the auto industry punching higher than its weight in job creation in recent years - accounting for between 60 percent and 80 percent of all U.S. manufacturing jobs added in 2015 and 2016.

In the first quarter of this year, the auto industry accounted for less than 2 percent of the 45,000 manufacturing jobs created.

“There’s no argument with the idea that auto has been pulling the manufacturing sled up the mountain for the last three or four years,” Muro said. “If you take auto out, you’re left with a very tepid outlook indeed.”

Long-term auto layoffs could threaten the economies of communities and states directly affected, although after decades of boom and bust, many communities in the auto manufacturing heartland have diversified.

In Ohio’s Mahoning Valley, which was battered by the collapse of the once-dominant steel industry, the boom in drilling for shale gas helps offset job cuts at auto plants.

Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill says the town salted away money during the boom to pay down its debts and new businesses are coming in, including a $900-million power plant being built in town that will burn cheap natural gas produced in the region.

GM makes up 40 percent of tax receipts versus 85 percent in the early 1990s, he said.

“GM is still the brightest star in the Mahoning Valley, but luckily we have diversified our economy,” Hill said. “There is pain for the laid-off workers, but it won’t hurt us as bad it used to.”

Lordstown’s workers have taken steps to blunt the impact of layoffs, with help from GM.

Matt Streb’s wife is due to start work soon after getting a degree, while he hopes to return to a former job as a mailman. In the meantime, GM gave advance notice of job cuts so he saved extra money and has drastically cut his spending.

""The auto industry is cyclical and has always had its ups and downs,"" Streb said. ""This is just another Lordstown downturn.""

STALLING SEDAN SALES

The decline in U.S. auto sales is still minor compared to the dramatic collapse during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when demand for new vehicles plunged to its lowest levels in decades.

However, the days when auto assembly and parts plants throughout the Midwest were running flat-out because of high demand for nearly every type of vehicle are over. Recent sales trends show consumers becoming more selective, shunning older models and especially smaller cars.

For much of the boom that ran from 2010 through to a record year in 2016 of 17.55 million new vehicles sold, the share of cars has declined versus “light trucks” - or pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

After peaking at 51.32 percent of all sales in 2012, passenger cars fell to 40.4 percent of sales in 2016. That decline equates to the output of seven or eight vehicle assembly plants.

Through the first five months of this year, sedan sales fell 11 percent, even as the light truck category rose 4.7 percent.

To avoid profit-sapping discounts, and reverse a decline in prices of used vehicles, automakers are ordering more and deeper production cuts.

GM has laid off more than 5,000 workers so far this year - including 1,000 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas that makes the Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. GM has also laid off 1,100 workers at a plant in Lansing because it has ended production of the GMC Acadia SUV there.

More GM workers will be hit with temporary layoffs this summer. Lordstown will shut up shop for five weeks this summer, much longer than the usual two-week summer vacation closure.

Many laid-off GM workers are finding temporary employment at other facilities or taking permanent transfers to plants like its Arlington, Texas, facility where production of large sport utility vehicles continues unabated. However, those temporary postings require workers to relocate hundreds of miles from home.

Randy Freeman, president of UAW Local 652 which represents workers at GM’s Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, which makes sedans, says he has been pleased by GM’s efforts to rehire workers and relations with the automaker “are on an upward swing.”

The threats to U.S. workers building sedans are not likely to ease, barring a spike in the price of gasoline. Ford Motor Co signaled its long-term pessimism about small-car demand in the United States by announcing plans on Tuesday to shift production of its Focus compact car model to China. The Michigan plant that builds the Focus currently is expected to switch to building trucks and SUVs in 2018.

At GM’s Lordstown and Lansing Grand River plants, UAW representatives say they are focused on improving quality in the hope that GM will pick their plant when it’s time to find a location for producing a new truck or SUV.

At Lordstown, for instance, union officials tout the fact the plant has just won a quality award for local innovation on a part that helps the Cruz run better.

“We’re working hard to make the best product we can,” said Glenn Johnson, president of UAW Local 1112 at Lordstown, “so we can raise our hands and say to GM ‘look at what we can do.”

Trump werde während seines Besuchs in Peking Staatschef Xi Jinping auffordern, die finanziellen Verbindungen zu Nordkorea zu kappen und die Resolutionen der Vereinten Nationen (UN) umzusetzen, sagte ein ranghoher Vertreter des Präsidialamtes. Trump traf am Mittwoch aus Südkorea kommend in Peking ein. Dort hatte der US-Präsident erneut scharfe Worte gegen die Führung Nordkoreas gefunden und diese vor weiteren Provokationen gewarnt. Die Bundesregierung forderte Nordkorea auf, ein Gesprächsangebot von Trump anzunehmen.

In Peking wurde Trump von Xi durch die Verbotene Stadt geleitet, eine Ehre, die ein chinesischer Präsident nur wenigen Gästen zuteilwerden lässt. Am Donnerstag sind die formellen Gespräche vorgesehen. China ist Trumps dritte Station einer zwölftägigen Asien-Reise. Zu den wichtigsten Gesprächsthemen in Peking dürften auch Handelsfragen gehören. Trump hat wiederholt den Überschuss Chinas im Handel mit den USA kritisiert.

Vor seiner Abreise hatte Trump China als eines der Länder genannt, die die internationalen Sanktionen gegen Nordkorea vollständig umsetzen und ihre diplomatischen und wirtschaftlichen Beziehungen herunterfahren müssten. Ob Xi darauf eingeht, war zunächst nicht abzusehen. China hat stets betont, dass sein Einfluss auf die Regierung in Pjöngjang überschätzt werde. Das Land halte sich strikt an die Resolutionen des UN-Sicherheitsrates. Sollte es Verstöße geben, würden dieses untersucht, sagte eine Sprecherin des Außenministeriums. China sei nach wie vor der Ansicht, dass der Konflikt im Dialog gelöst werden müsse.

INTERNATIONALER SCHULTERSCHLUSS GEGEN “BRUTALES REGIME”

Vor dem Parlament in Südkorea warnte Trump Nordkorea vor weiteren Provokationen. “Ich hoffe, dass ich für alle zivilisierten Nationen spreche, wenn ich zum Norden sage: Unterschätzt uns nicht. Und stellt uns nicht auf die Probe”, sagte er vor den Abgeordneten in Seoul. “Wir werden uns nicht einschüchtern lassen.” Nordkorea solle die Zurückhaltung der USA in der Vergangenheit nicht als Schwäche auslegen. An Machthaber Kim Jong Un gerichtet sagte Trump: Trotz aller Verbrechen, die dieser begangen habe, “sind wir bereit, einen Pfad zu einer viel besseren Zukunft anzubieten”.

Die Bundesregierung in Berlin erklärte, die nordkoreanische Führung täte gut dran, diese Gelegenheit zu nutzen und den ersten Schritt zu machen, indem sie ihre Testaktivitäten aussetze. Am Dienstag hatte Trump in Japan überraschend eine Verhandlungslösung ins Spiel gebracht, nachdem er und Nordkorea sich wochenlang gegenseitig mit kriegerischer Rhetorik überzogen und damit Sorgen vor einer militärischen Eskalation geschürt hatten.

In der Rede am Mittwoch schlug Trump dann wieder deutlich schärfere Töne an. Er forderte die internationale Gemeinschaft erneut zum Schulterschluss gegen Nordkorea auf, um “das brutale Regime” zu isolieren und ihm jegliche Form von Unterstützung, Versorgung oder Anerkennung zu verweigern. Die Welt dürfe nicht tolerieren, dass sie von einem “Schurkenregime mit nuklearer Verwüstung” bedroht werde. Trump rief Kim dazu auf, keine Raketen mehr zu entwickeln und nuklear komplett abzurüsten. Die USA strebten nach Frieden, aber sie seien zu Gesprächen nur bereit, wenn Kim vom Atomprogramm abrücke.",Trump fordert von China mehr Druck auf Nordkorea,https://www.reuters.com/article/nordkorea-trump-china-idDEKBN1D80SE

The lieutenant of billionaire investor David Einhorn says it gives him the sort of perspective he can’t get from sitting in an office.

“This is a really hard job to do by just looking at the stuff that comes across your desk. You have to go out and find it,” the 45-year old portfolio manager told Reuters.

His approach is paying off. Golden, who runs an $800 million portfolio for Einhorn's $8.3 billion hedge fund firm Greenlight Capital, is producing some of the best numbers in the fund of funds industry and also, in the past two years, beating his boss.

Infographic ID: '2s8LJrm'

Greenlight Masters beat or matched the benchmark in 12 out of the last 15 years of its existence and its average annualized return of 7.7 percent through the end of 2016 handily exceeded Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index’s 3.3 percent return over the same period.

It is rare for a company to run a so-called fund of funds alongside a hedge fund. By doing so, the Greenlight Masters portfolio offers clients valuable access to star investors such as Einhorn plus those still unknown on Wall Street, says Steve Algert, managing director and assistant treasurer at The J. Paul Getty Trust, one of Golden’s clients.

Golden is known for the time he takes – sometimes years - and the lengths he will go to in researching potential managers. If he believes in their ideas he will wait for them to pay off - a rarity in an industry where skittish investors often pull out at the first sign of trouble.

He can afford to do that because a significant amount of the capital in the portfolio comes from Einhorn and his partners at Greenlight Capital.

“Mitch hustles hard to know who’s out there and to develop relationships with people even if Greenlight Masters isn’t ready to invest immediately,” said Firefly Value Partners partner Ariel Warszawski, whose fund has been in the Greenlight Masters’ portfolio for a decade.

To beat the market, a manager has to be contrarian, Golden says, but he is wary of big egos and is looking for a dose of humility in candidates.

“We look for people who have confidence in their work and can pick a fight with the markets,” Golden said. “It is a very subtle balance.”

Brian Shapiro, whose firm Simplify LLC performs due diligence on hedge funds for wealthy clients, values Golden for his cool-headed analysis. “For him, if it is not in the numbers, it is not real.”

The native New Yorker likes to go beyond the usual interactions between managers and would-be investors in conference rooms which he describes as a “Kabuki dance” in reference to a Japanese dance-drama that involves stylized expressions and melodramatic plots.

Sometimes that means accompanying fund managers on company visits to gauge how they interact with management.

Earlier this year, he zipped around Vietnam’s biggest city on the back of a scooter to visit a company that one of his managers was considering investing in. He declined to name the company.

PLAYGROUND CHATS

On Saturday mornings, Golden says he will sometimes sit in a playground in Central Park talking stocks with one of his portfolio managers as their children careen down the slides.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Unlike many other funds of funds, Greenlight Masters does not automatically sell if a portfolio fund falls by a certain amount or steadily declines over a longer period.

In 2015, for example, Golden stuck with energy-focused funds despite plunging oil prices and Greenlight Masters lost 8.4 percent that year. Those funds roared back in 2016, helping it gain 13.4 percent and beat the 9.4 percent returned by Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and a flat performance by the average fund of funds.

He has 18 funds in the portfolio now, having exited three and added two last year. Thomas Hill’s $110 million PlusTick Partners and Nathaniel August’s $750 million Mangrove Partners, which invest in distressed energy assets, were Golden’s top performers in 2016 with gains of more than 50 percent each.

Golden acknowledges that the downside to the prolonged scrutiny is that sometimes promising fund managers will not wait and seek capital elsewhere or Greenlight Masters misses out on candidates’ early dramatic gains.

“That can be very costly,” he said, declining to name the opportunities he had missed.

Greenlight Masters is Einhorn’s brainchild, created in 2002, to uncover the next generations of stars and to give his partners a chance to diversify their holdings.

Golden joined it in 2012 as a co-portfolio manager after earlier stints as an analyst at two hedge funds and the manager of his own firm, and has run Greenlight Masters on his own since 2013.

After many months spent analyzing investments on his own, Golden brings promising candidates to a “D-meet” with Einhorn at Greenlight’s midtown Manhattan offices.

“All the Money in the World,” about the 1973 kidnapping of teenager John Paul Getty III, features Spacey as his grandfather, the late U.S. oil billionaire Jean Paul Getty.

The film was due to have a red carpet world premiere at the American Film Institute’s (AFI) annual festival in Los Angeles on Nov. 16.

“Given the current allegations surrounding one of its actors and out of respect for those impacted, it would be inappropriate to celebrate at a gala at this difficult time. Accordingly, the film will be withdrawn,” Sony’s TriStar Pictures unit said in an emailed statement.

Spacey’s representatives did not return a request for comment on Monday regarding Sony’s decision. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations.

The Sony statement said there were 800 other actors, writers and crew members involved in the movie, and the film would open wide as planned on Dec. 22.

Spacey apologized last month to actor Anthony Rapp, who accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. Spacey’s representatives later said he was seeking unspecified treatment.

CNN reported last week that eight current and former employees of the Netflix TV show “House of Cards,” who were not identified, alleged sexual misconduct against Spacey, the TV show’s star.

AFI said in a statement that it supported Sony’s decision.

Netflix said on Friday that it had severed ties with Spacey because of the allegations.

It said it would not be involved in further production of “House of Cards” with Spacey. Producer Media Rights Capital said Spacey had been suspended from the political show.

The tough message helped sway swing northeastern and Midwestern Rust Belt states Trump’s way in the 2016 election, but puts him at odds with companies and local leaders in the south, which has driven the recent growth in manufacturing jobs.

The southern states have voted for Trump, but have also spent decades wooing foreign companies with flexible labor laws, financial incentives and investment in ports, roads and other infrastructure.

POSTER CHILD AND WHIPPING BOY

The courtship has spawned new auto plants from Kentucky to Georgia, and a new Airbus (AIR.PA) plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Few places highlight the gap between Trump’s rhetoric and local aspirations better than Spartanburg in South Carolina.

German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) has invested here $8 billion in a 1.2 million square foot (11.15 hectares) assembly plant, which has become the largest single exporter of cars by value from the United States.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, a Republican and Trump supporter, credits the German automaker for putting his state on the global investment map.

“The presence of this company changed everything in the trajectory of our state,” McMaster said on Monday at an event unveiling BMW’s newest X3 sports utility vehicle.

Its Chief Executive Harald Krueger said the carmaker would invest additional $600 million in Spartanburg over the next four years, adding 1,000 jobs to the 9,000-strong workforce, and spend further $200 million on employee training and education.

But the poster child of South Carolina’s success also doubles as a whipping boy. In January, BMW’s plans to build a plant in Mexico drew Trump’s ire and last month the U.S. president was quoted as saying Germany was “very bad” on trade and selling too many cars in the United States.

And even as the company highlights its contribution to the U.S. economy and the benefits of free trade, it is hedging its bets by preparing for a possible protectionist backlash.

Outside of the spotlight, BMW is retooling factories in South Africa and China to build volume models like the X3 SUV, reducing its dependence on Spartanburg.

“We have a big footprint here, and we are flexible enough,“ Oliver Zipse, BMW’s board member responsible for manufacturing, told Reuters. ”We will build the X3 not only in Spartanburg, we will split it into South Africa and then to China, so we will have some flexibility to produce cars somewhere else,” he said.

“If something happens at the political level - which we don’t know yet - we are able to have a flexible response.”

The Trump administration has said it welcomes foreign investment and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who spoke at an opening of a new Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plant in South Carolina, said such projects showed that ”America is becoming an even stronger destination for global businesses looking to grow.”

The southern U.S. states owe much of their success to coastal port authorities and cities that have invested heavily to make their channels and docks fit for shipments to and from China and Mexico.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has often clashed with Trump, said protectionism would undermine those accomplishments and hurt American workers.

DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

“Negotiate a trade agreement with Europe, modernize NAFTA, don’t tear it up,” Graham told Reuters at the BMW factory. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We need more trade agreements, not less.”

Graham noted how low-cost competition from China and Mexico destroyed South Carolina’s once thriving textile industry and how the state reinvented itself as a manufacturing hub, bringing the likes of BMW or French tire maker Michelin (MICP.PA).

The now humming port city of Charleston has a similar story to tell. When a major navy base shut down in the 1990s wiping out 20,000 jobs, local officials worked to bring foreign manufacturers, which now employ around 10,000 in the three counties around the city and more is set to come.

Mercedes-Benz, part of Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), is adding 1,300 jobs so it can make its Sprinter van here rather than merely assemble it with imported parts, which also means more business for local suppliers.

Up the road, Volvo Car Group, part of Chinese conglomerate Geely [GEELY.UL], is due to open its first North American plant next year with a target workforce of 2,000.

Local development officials expect more jobs and investment to come, but worry that some steps discussed by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect.

Claire Gibbons, director of global marketing at the Charleston Regional Development Alliance, said the proposed new tariffs, tougher immigration rules and stricter reviews of foreign investment projects would amount to a “doomsday scenario” for the region.

“This is an education opportunity for us all, for the people making the decisions that don’t understand the ramifications.”

The SmarterSafer coalition sent a letter to members of the U.S. House urging passage of the compromise legislation that would extend to 2022 the federal program that has been heavily utilized after vast flooding from hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

“This legislative package moves the flood program in the right direction and contains needed reforms that will better protect those in harm’s way, the environment, and taxpayers,” the letter states, according to a copy seen by Reuters.

The hurdle came with the House Rules Committee indefinitely postponed a hearing on the bill that was scheduled for Tuesday night.

“Clearly they’re trying to make sure they’ve got all their ducks in a row and they’ve got all the votes they need,” said Steve Ellis, with the conservative group Taxpayers for Common Sense, which is part of a coalition pushing for reform of the program.

Joshua Saks, the legislative director of the National Wildlife Federation, said one of the shortcomings of the compromise is that it does not ensure that the money for flood mitigation projects will ever be spent.

“We need an Apollo project of mitigation right now, we need billions right now up front,” Saks said, referring to the project that put a man on the moon.

Two prominent Republican members of the U.S. House announced last week they had struck a deal that would extend the life of the program that covers most of the nation’s flood-prone properties.

House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas brokered the compromise and said the deal helps policy holders and taxpayers.

An affiliate of the Qatar Foundation Endowment (QFE) sold about 199.9 million shares in the phone carrier at 481 rupees each via a block trade, it said in a statement.

The sale price was a 6.4 percent discount to Bharti Airtel’s Tuesday closing price, but will still give the Qatari investor a significant return over its 68 billion-rupee investment in the Indian company in May 2013.

QFE will reinvest the proceeds from Bharti Airtel stake sale as part of growth of its global portfolio and diversification, it said in the statement.

Rashed Fahad Al-Noaimi, chief executive of investments at Qatar Foundation will step down from Bharti Airtel’s board after the settlement of the sale.

The sale comes at a time when other Qatari firms, including its sovereign wealth fund, are cutting stakes in foreign companies to raise cash and withstand pressure on the economy, which has been hit by sanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since early June.

The Gulf countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies.

Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, has responded to the crisis by pumping billions of dollars into local banks to shore up their deposits.

It has also reduced its stake in upscale jeweler Tiffany & Co (TIF.N), Russian energy giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).

Bharti Airtel shares closed 3.7 percent down at 495.30 rupees. Still, the stock is up 62 percent in 2017 on signs of an end to a bruising price war in the Indian telecoms space and hopes that industry consolidation would benefit established players.

JPMorgan on Wednesday upgraded the stock to “neutral” from “underweight”, saying the fundamentals for large players in were “falling in place sooner than expected”.

The deal will bolster second-ranked SSE, creating a supply group with 11 billion pounds in combined sales that could kick off a consolidation in the British energy market where established firms are battling smaller, nimble rivals.

The roughly 11.5 million customer accounts of the new firm would move SSE closer to Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, which has more than 14 million.

The company, in which SSE would have a stake of about two thirds, and British Gas would together control more than 50 percent of the market, but Innogy Chief Executive Peter Terium said he was confident British regulators would approve the deal.

“When we look at the competitive landscape and the uncertain political environment for energy retailers in Great Britain, it is clear that npower would be better placed to offer value to our customers and our shareholders as part of a new company,” Terium said.

The deal, which needs support from SSE shareholders and Innogy’s supervisory board, would cut the number of big energy retailers in Britain to five from six. Closing is expected in late 2018 or early 2019.

By merging their retail units, Innogy and SSE form a group with pro-forma sales of 10.9 billion pounds and operating profit of 123 million pounds in 2017. It is expected to become a small or midcap stock once listed on the London Stock Exchange.

“TOXIC LIMB”

Smaller rivals, often able to offer cheaper deals due to lower overheads, now control around 20 percent of Britain’s market up from less than 1 percent a decade ago. Analysts expect further consolidation in future.

Rival E.ON (EONGn.DE), one of Britain’s big six power suppliers, on Wednesday said it had lost 200,000 customers in Britain so far this year.

Overall, there are around 60 energy suppliers operating in Britain at the moment.

“Given the interference in the market with the price cap, and pressure on margins, the natural reaction is for companies is to try to gain scale,” said Peter Atherton, an associate at consultancy Cornwall Insight.

Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which will need to approve the merger, said it was aware of the deal but would not comment when asked if it would give its approval.

Analysts expressed concerns about potential problems combining Innogy’s and SSE’s IT platforms, which according to Bernstein run on two different systems.

“While SSE and Innogy can sever a toxic limb through the transaction, 100 percent of RetailCo’s earnings will be exposed to UK political risks and competitive risks,” Deepa Venkateswaran, senior analyst at Bernstein, said.

SSE will hold 65.6 percent of the new entity, which will not include its business retail and Ireland operations. Innogy will hold the rest. It will receive a 60 million pounds break fee if SSE fails to get approval for the move by July 31, 2018.

“This process is likely to take some time and in the interim we remain absolutely focused on the critical job of delivering for customers,” said Alistair Phillips-Davies, Chief Executive of SSE.","SSE, Innogy to create UK retail power firm with 11 billion pound sales",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-sse-innogy/sse-innogy-to-create-uk-retail-power-firm-with-11-billion-pound-sales-idUKKBN1D80NM

Here is a summary of the EU’s vision of both the immediate period after Britain leaves the bloc and its future trade relationship, as outlined in the documents seen by Reuters ahead of a meeting of the 27 on Wednesday.

The EU plans to engage with Britain on these two issues only after the first, ongoing round of divorce talks advances enough to merit new negotiations with London on what comes after Brexit.

The current, slow-moving talks have focused mainly on matters surrounding Britain’s actual split from the bloc, namely the exit bill, safeguarding expatriate rights and the future Irish border.

The EU is waiting for Britain’s moves on these key issues before it agrees to open talks about the transition and future ties. That may happen in December but is not a given.

* Crucially, the EU is determined to ensure Brexit does not leave Britain better off economically or otherwise, as this could create a precedent undermining the bloc’s purpose and existence in the future.

A discussion document for the Wednesday meeting in Brussels hence says that “a non-member of the Union, that does not live up to the same obligations as a member, cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member.”

* Britain’s request for a transition period of about two years in which the status quo would be largely preserved “would require a temporary application of Union law to and within the United Kingdom together with... regulatory, budgetary, supervisory, judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures,” it reads.

* EU 27 will look further into how such a temporary arrangement would impact the bloc’s cooperation with third countries, including on trade, fisheries or air transport.

* The bloc will also seek to ensure Britain adheres to EU rules - including any changes - during transition, and the possible avenue for communication with London since it would “no longer be represented in the EU institutions and participate in the decision-making process.”

* For any agreement on the future ties with London, the EU expects safeguards to preserve financial stability and rules out British participation in parts, but not all, of its single market.

* The bloc is keen to protect itself against “unfair competitive advantages through... tax, social, environmental and regulatory measures and practices.”

* Beyond trade, the EU is keen to maintain cooperation with Britain on security - including fighting terrorism and international crime - defence and foreign policy.

* The bloc seeks a “balance of rights and obligations” for Britain and is determined to preserve the “indivisible” four freedoms of its single market - of goods, capital, services and labour.

* Inside the bloc, the EU wants to preserve the role of the top European Court of Justice, from whose jurisdiction London wants to remove itself.

* After Britain leaves, no agreement between the EU and UK would apply to Gibraltar without a separate accord between London and Madrid.

* In preparing their own stance on transition and future ties, the 27 will “bear in mind the UK position.”",Factbox - EU's vision of post-Brexit transition and future ties with Britain,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-factbox/factbox-eus-vision-of-post-brexit-transition-and-future-ties-with-britain-idUKKBN1D81CV

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, overcame a barrage of attack ads by Republican Ed Gillespie that hit the soft-spoken Democrat on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.

Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but did not campaign with him, had taken a break from his Asia trip to send tweets and record messages on Tuesday supporting the former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

But after the outcome, Trump quickly distanced himself from Gillespie.

“Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Trump tweeted. “With the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!”

At his victory party, Northam told supporters the sweeping Democratic win in Virginia sent a message to the country.

“Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,” Northam said.

The Virginia race highlighted a slate of state and local elections that also included a governor’s race in New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and ambassador to Germany, defeated Republican Kim Guadagno for the right to succeed Republican Chris Christie.

Murphy had promised to be a check on Trump in Democratic-leaning New Jersey. Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, was hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie.

BOOST FOR DEMOCRATS

Murphy’s win and the Northam victory in Virginia, a state Democrat Hillary Clinton won by 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, provided a much-needed boost for national Democrats who were desperate to turn grassroots resistance to Trump into election victories.

Democrats had already lost four special congressional elections earlier this year.

But a strong turnout in the Democratic-leaning northern Virginia suburbs of Washington helped propel Northam, who in the end won relatively easily. With nearly all precincts reporting, he led by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin.

Exit polls in Virginia showed that one-third of the voters went to the polls to oppose Trump, and only 17 percent went to support him.

Democrats also swept the other top statewide Virginia races, winning the offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general, and gained seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrat Danica Roem beat a long-time Republican incumbent to become the first transgender person to win a state legislative race.

“This is a comprehensive political victory from statehouse to courthouse. Thank you Donald Trump!” Democratic U.S. Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told Northam’s supporters at a victory party in northern Virginia.

In Virginia, Democrats had worried that if Gillespie won, Republicans would see it as a green light to emphasize divisive cultural issues in their campaigns for next year’s elections, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the U.S. Senate’s 100 seats come up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.

Gillespie, speaking to crestfallen supporters in Richmond, Virginia, said he had run a “very policy-focused campaign.”

But voters in Arlington County - a suburban Democratic stronghold bordering Washington - said national politics were important to their votes.

“Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” said Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s presidential nomination.

Peacemaker said Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies after securing the Republican gubernatorial nomination.

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election.

A Coreia do Norte e o comércio devem dominar a parte formal da visita, que termina na sexta-feira, mas a China está determinada a mostrar a importância que dá à visita de Trump, a primeira de um líder estrangeiro desde o fim de uma edição crucial do congresso do Partido Comunista no mês passado na qual Xi consolidou seu poder.

Trump e sua esposa, Melania, foram levados do aeroporto de Pequim --onde foram recebidos pelo principal diplomata chinês, Yang Jiechi, um elemento fundamental da aproximação de Trump desde que este venceu a eleição presidencial norte-americana um ano atrás-- diretamente para a Cidade Proibida.

Conversando e bebendo chá, Trump mostrou a Xi um vídeo de sua neta, Arabella Kushner, cantando em mandarim e recitando poesias chinesas tradicionais, o que levou Xi a cumprimentá-la por seu desempenho, digno de uma nota “A+”, segundo a mídia estatal chinesa.

Xi disse torcer para que Arabella visite a China em breve, observando que ela já é uma “estrela infantil” no país, disse a agência de notícias estatal Xinhua.

Rompendo mais um precedente, o próprio Xi ofereceu ao casal Trump uma turnê pelos tesouros imperiais da Cidade Proibida, um patrimônio mundial tombado pela Organização das Nações Unidas para a Educação, a Ciência e a Cultura (Unesco) e fechado para turistas neste dia, antes de os dois primeiros-casais assistirem a uma ópera chinesa e a uma demonstração de acrobacias.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.","BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in China on Wednesday seeking help to rein in North Korea, telling the reclusive state’s leader he was putting his country in grave danger by developing nuclear weapons.

Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”

“Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit.

Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations.

Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.”

He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.”

The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

“The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region.

‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’

In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance.

While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures.

During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul.

He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed.

The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official.

Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added.

Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday.

Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said.

While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions.

‘GRAVE DANGER’

During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”

However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach.

North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving.

“North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.

He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader.

Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.”

The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said.

A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.

“The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One.

This is Buhari’s third budget to parliament and like the previous ones, sets a record high level of spending, but analysts say implementation, particularly on capital expenditure that is meant to drive infrastructure development, has been lacking.

“Mostly, I think that they are setting themselves yet more unattainable goals,” said John Ashbourne, Africa economist at Capital Economics.

“The federal government falls short on its revenue and expenditure targets every year, and Buhari always responds by writing an even more ambitious target into the budget for the following year,” he said.

With 2.4 trillion naira of intended capital spending, the budget forecast a deficit of 2.005 trillion naira ($6.56 billion), down from last year’s 2.36 trillion naira.

To help plug that gap, Buhari said the government would borrow 1.699 trillion naira, half of it from overseas.

Debt costs are, however, already high in Nigeria and the president also said almost a quarter of the budget’s expenditure would go to servicing debt.

Economists have also noted that while the budgets reach new highs, they have risen at a slower clip than inflation. The new budget is about 16 percent higher than the previous year‘s, while Buhari said inflation for 2018 is expected to be 12.4 percent.

He told parliament that the budget was based on an exchange rate of 305 naira to the dollar, and a projected oil output of 2.3 million barrels per day at an assumed price of $45 per barrel.

He said he was targeting Jan. 1, 2018 for passage of the new budget and that the deficit is expected to be 2.005 trillion naira, with real economic growth estimated at 3.5 percent for 2018.

But previous budgets have been beset by wrangling with lawmakers over line items. The 2017 budget was not signed into law until halfway through this year, and even then, some spending was still being debated.

The 2018 budget must still be approved by the lower and upper chambers of parliament before it can be signed into law, a process that can take many months.

That makes Broadcom’s roughly $105 billion unsolicited offer for Qualcomm on Monday all the more edgy. The borrowing associated with a deal, if it happens, could be in record amounts and may send debt-to-EBITDA ratios uncomfortably high.

One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

Broadcom boss Hock Tan is facing down two sources of uncertainty. One is whether his counterpart Steve Mollenkopf will engage over the deal, which offers a 27.6 percent premium. So far, Qualcomm’s response has been noncommittal. The other is Qualcomm’s ongoing $38 billion bid to buy NXP – which listed shakily in 2010 and subsequently bought Freescale in 2015. Tan says he’ll take Qualcomm with or without NXP.

Then there’s sheer scale. The bid, worth $130 billion including Qualcomm debt, according to Broadcom, will require nearly $90 billion of cash. Private-equity outfit Silver Lake is providing $5 billion in convertible debt, with the rest to be raised by Bank of America, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Add in the companies’ existing net debt, and the new group’s total would be over $100 billion, even if more cash accumulates before the deal closes. That’s four or five times the $23 billion in combined EBITDA Broadcom is expecting, including cost savings.

Consolidation among makers of chips for mobile phones, cars and the rest is all the rage, and Tan is an experienced dealmaker with a record of bringing debt down quickly after acquisitions. But it’s still a cyclical industry. The merged company would have to keep big customers like Apple happy, which might mean cutting prices. Meanwhile, $3 billion of annual cost-cuts, taxed and capitalised, are worth about the same as the roughly $22 billion premium, so Broadcom isn’t keeping much for its own shareholders.

At least one deal hurdle – the U.S. examination of foreign acquirers – has been pre-empted. The Singapore-domiciled Broadcom will move to the United States, Tan said last week in a press conference with President Donald Trump. Investors seem to have caught the boosterish mood, pushing up the stock of both companies to the tune of more than $20 billion altogether since Thursday.

ROMA/MILANO, 3 novembre (Reuters) - Piaggio Aerospace dovrà assicurare la totale separazione tra il ramo jet privati che intende vendere a un consorzio cinese e il business militare, nonché reinvestire i proventi della vendita soprattutto nel programma del drone P2HH.

Sono due punti contenuti nel decreto del Presidente del Consiglio, adottato su proposta della ministra della Difesa Roberta Pinotti, dopo che Mubadala, il fondo sovrano di Abu Dhabi proprietario del gruppo italiano, ha notificato all‘esecutivo il progetto di vendita del ramo di azienda che produce il jet executive P180 nell‘ambito delle procedure previste per il golden power nel settore difesa.

Ad acquisire il ramo d‘azienda sarebbe infatti PAC-Investments, società con sede in Lussemburgo supportata da investitori cinesi sia privati che governativi, si legge nel documento.

Il decreto prevede che Piaggio Aerospace e Mubadala adottino “misure di tutela e di protezione, attive e passive, concernenti ogni elemento, di natura materiale o immateriale, con particolare riguardo ai diritti di proprietà industriale, al know-how, alle informazioni riservate, relativi ai programmi militari”, come quelli dei droni P1HH e P2HH e del velivolo multiruolo MPA.

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump.

The watchdog said in September it would block Facebook starting next year unless the social network complied with a law requiring websites that store the personal data of Russian citizens to do so on Russian servers.

“In the near future Roskomnadzor will plan a series of supervisory activities aimed at analyzing the activities of the administration of Facebook in terms of the processing of Russian users’ personal information, the terms of services for users, and the content of existing legislation,” it said in a statement on Wednesday carried by the Interfax news agency.

Russian authorities say the law, introduced in 2014, is aimed at protecting Russians’ personal data.

Critics, however, see its use as an attack on social media in a country that has tightened its control over the Internet in recent years.

Lower gold purchases by India, the world’s second-biggest consumer after China, could drag global prices that have already fallen nearly 6 percent from this year’s peak.

“October imports were lower than last year and even in November and December they are likely to be lower than last year,” Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst with GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters, said on Wednesday.

India’s imports could fall to around 175 tonnes in October-December from 234 tonnes a year ago, Nambiath said.

In the first nine months of 2017, the country’s gold imports surged 131 percent to 638.4 tonnes, according to GFMS data, as jewellers advanced buying in the first half of the year ahead of a sales tax hike that took effect from July 1.

Gold demand usually strengthens in the final quarter as Indians brace for the wedding season as well as festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra, when buying bullion is considered auspicious.

But appetite for the precious metal during Diwali was lower than normal, said Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in Chennai in southern India.

Gold imports last month fell 10 percent from a year ago to 75 tonnes, provisional data from GFMS showed.

“I do not see a big jump in imports in coming months. Overall demand is weak,” said Jayant Pawania, group executive vice president at Yes Bank, a major bullion importer.

“People are parking more money in financial assets. Investment demand is very weak,” said Pawania, who also expects gold imports in the current quarter to be around 175 tonnes.

Just 36 hours earlier, the city had been filled with nearly as many rival activists − this time waving uni-starred flags, yelling “Viva la República Catalana!” to show their support for the Catalan Republic, the new, sovereign country theoretically created when Catalonia’s autonomous provincial government Friday controversially declared itself free of Spain.

In the time between the two marches, Spain’s conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had dismissed Catalonia’s independence declaration as “null and void”; fired the Catalonia cabinet; dissolved Catalonia’s parliament; called new elections, and announced the central government was stepping in to oversee the regional authorities, which until Friday had held substantial powers of self-rule.

Rajoy’s action, declared Catalonia Vice President Oriol Junqueras, was a “coup d’état” directed by the “anti-democratic” prime minister in Madrid. “The president of the country is and will be Carles Puigdemont,” said Junqueras, referring to Catalonia’s regional president in a piece for the newspaper El Punt Avui. Junqueras is correct about one thing: a coup has indeed rattled this province. But the instigators aren't in Madrid. Despite appearing rigidly authoritarian, Rajoy has Spanish law, the courts, the national Senate, the king, and the 1978 constitution solidly backing his actions in lassoing runaway Catalonia back into Spain. It is not the Spanish government, but the separatists in Catalonia, where a July poll showed 41 percent wanted independence and 49 percent wanted to stay in Spain, who are undermining democracy in this land.

Junqueras, Puigdemont and their social media-savvy band of separatists, have leveraged historical grudges to create rancor and division, making a mockery of the very democracy they claim to desire by saying that it’s Spain, with elections, a healthy constitution, and a decentralized government, that is undemocratic.

Puigdemont, an avowed independence supporter and onetime-mayor of Girona, was an unelected appointee to the regional president’s seat in Jan. 2016, chosen by a parliamentary coalition that shared little but a desire for separatism. Dubbed “the accidental president,” he became the first leader of Catalonia to refuse to pledge loyalty to Spain’s constitution and king.

Filling their cabinet only with like-minded members, Puigdemont and Junqueras emphasized independence above all and promised a referendum on leaving Spain. However, Spain’s constitution, approved by 90 percent of Catalan voters in 1978, holds that the regions can only secede if all Spanish voters approve it. In spite of that, Puigdemont ignored Rajoy’s warnings and the Constitutional Court’s ruling that a vote on independence was unconstitutional and illegal.

For months, the separatist faction of the Barcelona-based government made misleading promises. An independent Catalonia would remain in the European Union, they said − even though the EU had said that declaring independence would effectively be resigning from the group. A report from the regional Ministry of Economy, headed by Junqueras, concluded that international investment would rise and wealthy Catalonia would remain economically viable despite warnings from major businesses that they’d move their headquarters, and perhaps relocate entirely if independence was declared.

Separatists riled up the populace with fervent rallies, where they claimed the national government in Madrid was robbing Catalonia, and depicting Catalans as victimized and oppressed. On Sept.7, the secessionist camp in parliament pushed through a bill on holding the referendum ignoring standard procedure, including discussion and advance notice it would be on the agenda. While 52 of the 135 parliamentarians left in disgust, the bill passed with 72 votes.

Puigdemont and Junqueras appeared to revel in the calls from Rajoy to drop the plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 1, perhaps realizing that any move from the national government would be seen as Goliath stomping on David. On that count, they were right. Instead of ignoring it, Madrid sent out national police to try to prevent the vote from taking place. The police were largely unsuccessful and their attempt short-lived, but the images of them battering doors, knocking down the elderly, dragging voters down stairs, pulling women by their hair and shooting at civilians with rubber bullets did more to alarm the world and rally support for the separatist call than any advertising campaign could have achieved. Later reports showed the number of injuries, initially thought to be over 800, had been exaggerated, as had some reports of victimization.

Missing in the dramatic imagery beamed worldwide was the fact that the disorganized vote was marred by more than violence: as Madrid tried to shut down voting stations, basic polling safeguards were overlooked and the Catalan government announced that regardless of registration, Catalans could cast ballots anywhere − creating the potential for repeat voting. Since voters had been warned by Madrid that the referendum was illegal, it was largely boycotted by those who wanted to stay in Spain; only some 2 million Catalans of 5 million-plus potential voters cast their ballots. Despite this low turnout and allegations of voter fraud, the Catalan government hailed the result as a 90 percent vote for independence.

After nearly four weeks of double-speak and canceled announcements about independence − during which over 1,000 businesses moved their headquarters outside Catalonia and tourism plummeted − Puigdemont referred the issue to the regional parliament, which held a secret ballot about it on Oct 27. Of the 135 parliamentarians, 70 wrote yes, 10 wrote no, and the rest stormed out. Many left Spanish flags on their empty chairs. Before the hour was out, Spain’s Senate in Madrid agreed to invoke the constitution’s never-before-used Article 155, giving Madrid the authority to suspend Catalonia’s government. Hours later, Rajoy announced that the central government was taking over.

Puigdemont, Junqueras and other Catalan cabinet members may now face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Puigdemont slipped off to Brussels, where his Belgian lawyer says he will not return to Spain. Junqueras still wants to tackle the creation of his new republic, writing in a New York Times op-ed column published Wednesday that Catalonia would not retreat. “In a battle for self-determination and the recognition of rights, one does not win with the first punch,” he said.

It will be an uphill battle even in the unlikely event that the central government lets Junqueras stay in office. A new poll, just published in El Mundo, shows the number of Catalans supporting independence has dropped to 33 percent.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday Moscow opposed a draft U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of the investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Ryabkov’s comments came hours after Russia rejected a report by the international inquiry blaming the Syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack on April 4.

In a joint statement by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the United States, the four countries said they had full confidence in the findings and called on the Syrian regime to end all use of poison gas and finally declare to the OPCW all the chemical weapons it possesses.

“We therefore urge the United Nations Security Council to maintain the investigative capacity” of the inquiry, the statement said.

“After such a report, the Security Council and all its members have a common responsibility to protect the international non-proliferation regime and to respect their previous commitments,” the joint statement said.

The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The April 4 attack prompted a U.S. missile strike just days later against a Syrian air base. France has warned that any further chemicals attacks would be met with a military response.

Russia, a key backer of the Syrian government, last month cast a veto at the United Nations Security Council against renewing the investigation’s mandate.

The inquiry had previously found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.

Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons and comply with the OPCW in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States, after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in the Damascus suburbs. Western countries blamed that attack on the Syrian government, which denied it.","In message to Russia, Western powers demand U.N. extend Syria toxic gas inquiry",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicals/in-message-to-russia-western-powers-demand-u-n-extend-syria-toxic-gas-inquiry-idUKKBN1D820C?il=0

Macri, though, replied in the affirmative when asked whether his government would go to the WTO to contest the duties if they were confirmed at the preliminary level of as much as 64.17 percent.

The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to make a decision setting final antidumping duties on Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel, which threatens to price its exports of the primarily soy-based fuel out of the U.S. market.

Argentina has been trying to settle the trade dispute by negotiating a minimum price for its exports, but no deal has yet been reached.

Macri, who reached out to U.S. President Donald Trump soon after he was elected in a bid to rekindle a relationship they formed as businessmen before entering politics, portrayed the dispute as one between private industries rather than governments.

The Argentine president, who has made signing trade deals a priority, said he was optimistic that Mercosur, the trade bloc formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, would be able to conclude a free trade deal with the European Union by year-end despite differences over beef and other agribusiness matters.

“I feel that the European Union is really committed to finding an agreement with Mercosur,” he said, predicting that a deal could be signed at the WTO Ministerial Conference scheduled to happen in Buenos Aires in early December. “They know they need some good news after Brexit.”

Macri, who is wrapping up a two-day visit to the United States during which he met with executives from companies including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and DowDuPont Inc (DWDP.N) predicted the Argentine economy would grow “a little more than 3 percent” in 2017.

“Yes, I am optimistic,” he said. “Everyone says 2.8 percent, I say a little more than 3 percent.”

Macri, whose Cambiemos coalition coasted to a sweeping victory in mid-term elections last month, acknowledged that if his forecast came true his government would likely have to make payments on debt linked to the country’s economic performance.",Exclusive: Argentina's Macri says would contest U.S. biodiesel tariffs with WTO,https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-argentina-exclusive/exclusive-argentinas-macri-says-would-contest-u-s-biodiesel-tariffs-with-wto-idUSKBN1D734R

Thousands of U.N. peacekeepers, French troops and U.S. military trainers and drone operators have failed to stem a growing wave of jihadist violence, leading international powers to pin their hopes on a new regional force.

But the so-called G5 Sahel initiative faces immense challenges if it is to do any better at bringing security to the arid Sahel region than its countries Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger have managed so far.

Security sources and analysts say too strong an emphasis on military might over tackling the underlying causes of jihad, logistical shortfalls and a lack of cooperation from regional powerhouse Algeria all raise doubts over whether the G5 can succeed where years of Western intervention has not.

“There is a long way to go to reach full operational capacity, even though the timeframe is relatively short,” G5 force commander General Didier Dacko told visiting U.N. Security Council envoys last month, citing a range of needs from aerial support to communications equipment to intelligence gathering.

The United Nations, France and the United States have poured billions of dollars into stabilizing the region over the past 15 years but have failed to meaningfully address the many local grievances driving conflict, analysts say.

Political and social tensions, such as a stalled peace process between the government and armed groups in Mali, are pushing youths to jihad, as are growing rivalries between farmers and cattle herders and rights abuses by national armies.

In northern Burkina Faso, for example, preacher Malam Ibrahim Dicko has gained adherents to his militant Ansarul Islam movement by railing against the privileges of traditional elites in a region scarred by widespread poverty.

Some local groups have affiliated themselves with global franchises such as al Qaeda and Islamic State, whose dwindling presence in the Middle East has led Western governments to zero in on the vast lawless tracts of North and West Africa to prevent them finding new footholds.

But the militant groups in the Sahel draw more on frustrations with central governments and the Western forces that back them than a global jihadist agenda, making security-heavy approaches risky, analysts say.

“I think local communities in Mali and Niger feel alienated and confused by the actions of those entities,” said Alexander Thurston, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who specializes in Islam and politics in West Africa.

“The problems require political solutions, ultimately, and the G5 is a small and underfunded force.”

FUNDING SHORTFALLS

The G5’s backers say they recognize the need for longer-term economic development, not just a beefed-up security presence. In Mali last month, France’s U.N. envoy Francois Delattre called the two “absolutely inseparable”.

But when it comes to coughing up, development often gets short-changed. A U.N. initiative to support regional security, governance and development has only received 30 percent of its budget since 2013, with the latter two areas worst hit.

France is keenly backing the G5, hoping it will provide an eventual exit strategy for its own costly 4,000-strong counter-terrorism taskforce in the region, Operation Barkhane.

“Terrorist groups in the Sahel now represent a global threat,” French Foreign Minster Jean-Yves Le Drian told the Security Council last week. “The G5 Sahel joint force is the right response to this challenge.”

The threat Islamist militants pose was underscored by last month’s attack in Niger that killed eight U.S. and Nigerien troops, prompting American officials to predict U.S. involvement in the region would intensify.

Across the street from the snipers’ perch in Sevare, Mali, inside the G5 headquarters, General Dacko told Security Council diplomats how he planned to take on the 1,000 or so “terrorists” he estimated operate in the area.

Joint patrols, hot pursuit operations and intelligence sharing among the five countries contributing to the force, which should eventually boast nearly 5,000 soldiers, will chase out drug traffickers and militants, he said.

Neither the U.N. mission in Mali, which cannot operate across borders, nor the French taskforce, which has concentrated on training local forces and going after high value targets, has made securing the region’s porous borders a priority.

Last week, the G5 deployed its first several hundred troops from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso to their shared borderlands where jihadists have carried out dozens of attacks this year.

“The G5 is a source of hope and we believe in it completely,” Dacko said.

Initially skeptical of the force, the United States pledged up to $60 million last week. Even so, commitments from the G5 countries and donors stand at only a third of the estimated $490 million the force needs in its first year.

NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH

Money, logistical support and local opposition aside, Dacko said he was concerned about the relationship with the continent’s biggest country, Algeria, with which the G5 nations share a collective border roughly 2,500 km (1,500 miles) long.

Islamist militant groups emerged in Algeria in the early 1990s and then spread beyond its borders. The country’s constitution prohibits foreign military intervention but analysts say its collaboration is essential because of its intelligence networks’ intimate knowledge of regional militants.

Dacko, however, said there was no process as yet to formalize security cooperation between the G5 and the North Africa country.

Algerian officials were not immediately available to comment.

A source familiar with the Algerian government’s thinking said it already had channels of cooperation with G5 military officials and questioned the need for a new force.

“You have MINUSMA (the U.N. peacekeeping mission) in Mali ... so why another regional group to fight terror in the Sahel?” the source said.

Algeria also sees the G5 as effectively being controlled by its former colonial master France, with which it fought a bitter independence war and has since regarded with suspicion.

“Algeria perceives the G5 Sahel as an extension of French influence in a region in which Algeria has traditionally been dominant, and in which France has historically played an essentially destabilizing role,” Hannah Armstrong, an Algeria expert at the International Crisis Group, said.

Algeria mediated talks leading to the 2015 peace deal in Mali but it is sometimes suspected of not doing all it could to prevent militants using its desert spaces as a rear base.

“It is essential to find ways to partner (with Algeria),” said Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga, Mali’s former intelligence chief. “As long as there is not a shared evaluation, you cannot imagine a common course of action.”

Revolut, which has offered a pre-paid cash card since 2015, is one of a number of smaller upstart finance firms hoping that coming regulation and technology can help it break the dominance of bigger banks.

Financial technology firms like Revolut are trying to chip away at traditional banks by offering users slick apps, slashed fees and an instant overview of their finances. From challenger banks to digital currencies like Bitcoin, the British government regards the ‘fintech’ sector as a key source of growth.

Changes coming into force in Britain and across the European Union will see banks forced to open up their closely held customer data to rivals, who will be able to use it to build products and better target clients.

Peers like Britain’s Starling Bank and Monzo and Germany’s N26 have already secured banking licenses ahead of the new rules.

“Even without a banking license, we have attracted over 950,000 users across Europe, many of whom consider Revolut as their primary current account and spending card,” said Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut’s founder and CEO.

The firm’s tagline promises an experience “beyond banking”, but so far it has been unable to offer some of the core services provided by banks, including current accounts, overdrafts, loans and direct debits.

It expects to receive a license effective in the first half of 2018 and to start offering these services in select markets straightaway.

It said it has applied for its license through the Lithuanian central bank and has sufficient capital in place.

Current accounts and credit will initially be available to users in Lithuania, before being rolled out to Estonia and Latvia and, as soon as possible, Britain. Next in line are France, Germany and Italy and eventually the rest of the European Union, the firm said.

Fintech lender Cashplus said last week it was considering applying for a UK banking license, while telecoms giant Orange has launched its own bank in France in a bid to steal established lenders’ market share by capitalizing on the rise of smartphones.

But incumbent banks are stepping up investment in their own digital platforms too.

The EU will only engage with Britain on its future trade relationship and how a post-Brexit transition period will work, as London wishes, after the first, ongoing round of divorce talks have sufficiently progressed.

Brussels wants three issues broadly solved before giving the green light -- the exit bill, safeguarding expatriate rights and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK’s only land frontier with the EU after its departure.

“I‘m now of the view that it is likely that we will be able to say that sufficient progress has been made at the December (EU leaders) meeting, allowing us to move onto discussions on transition and the future arrangements, but that’s just my prediction at this stage,” Leo Varadkar told parliament.

“This of course will all depend on what happens over the next number of weeks and what specific assurances and guarantees in writing we can get from the United Kingdom.”

Varadkar, who said he was more optimistic than he was a number of weeks ago with talks “moving in the right direction”, struck a more positive tone than his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, who said recently that Dublin could not let talks progress without further clarity on the border.

The Irish government has called on Britain to do more than simply promise a “hard” border will not return between it and Northern Ireland, which until a 1998 peace deal was separated by military checkpoints because of 30 years of sectarian violence in the British province.

They said some may already be considering that as a useful tactic against Britain, which is anxious to prevent businesses relocating investment.

Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger has been talking with Fox about the possibility of a mashup between the two media conglomerates, according to a CNBC report on Monday. Fox would sell its international assets, including its 39 percent equity stake in European pay-TV group Sky, along with its movie and cable units. It would keep its U.S. broadcast stations and eponymous news network, which is undergoing its own transformation after a spate of recent sexual-harassment allegations.

The details were scarce but one thing is clear: scale is a necessity. As distributors become larger - AT&T is seeking to close its $85 billion deal for Time Warner for instance - media companies have to follow. Netflix’s success in securing 100 million subscribers worldwide and its plan to spend some $8 billion on content next year adds to the pressure.

The acquisition of Fox programming would strengthen Disney’s arsenal as it prepares to launch its direct-to-consumer video offerings from its entertainment networks and sports giant ESPN. Fox too has acknowledged the need for scale with its failed $80 billion tilt at Time Warner in 2014 and its second run for full control of Sky, still waiting for UK regulatory approval.

That’s what makes possible retreat by the Murdoch family all the more puzzling. Murdoch built his empire from newspapers he inherited from his father in Australia and turned them into a global enterprise housing everything from Fox News to “The Simpsons” to Star India.

Murdoch, who is executive chairman, and his family hold nearly 40 percent of the voting shares in Fox and sister company News Corp.

The attacks in the English-speaking city of Bamenda marked the worst fighting in recent years between secessionist militants and government forces in the central African state after a year of mostly peaceful protest.

Anglophone lawyers and teachers launched demonstrations a year ago against what they see as a marginalization of English-speakers by President Paul Biya’s government in the Northwest and Southwest regions who were forced to work in French.

A harsh crackdown by state forces, including the use of helicopter gunships to fire on civilians, has killed dozens of people and bolstered support for the once-fringe separatist movement ahead of presidential elections in 2018.

Cho Ayaba, a leading member of the Ambazonian Governing Council, a separatist body established to create an independent state called Ambazonia, said secessionist militants killed three gendarmes in two coordinated attacks in Bamenda, the capital of the predominantly English-speaking Northwest region.

Cameroonian security sources reported the deaths of two gendarmes in an overnight attack near Bamenda, with one senior military official blaming the secessionists. Another source said the gendarmes were ambushed by armed men on motorbikes.

Cameroon’s government spokesman and chief of police could not be reached immediately for comment.

Ayaba said members of the Ambazonian Defence Force, an armed wing of the separatist movement, killed two gendarmes in a first attack around 2 a.m. (0100 GMT) at a checkpoint near Bamenda airport, and a third was killed in an ambush on a gendarme patrol unit in a Bamenda suburb about an hour later.

“We carried out the actions,” said Ayaba. “Their security forces are a target and we will continue attacking them until they are gone.” Another separatist leader confirmed his account.

Cameroon’s linguistic divide harks back a century to the League of Nations’ decision to split the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors at the end of World War One.

The secessionist movement has existed for decades underground but has only recently started to gain widespread support in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest in response to the government’s repression of protests.

Hundreds of Anglophone Cameroonians were swept up in mass arrests following violent demonstrations on Oct. 1, and at least 5,000 have fled the crisis for neighboring Nigeria.",Cameroon separatists kill at least two gendarmes as Anglophone dispute escalates,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D81S0-OZATP

Weakened by losing her party’s majority in a June election, May faces another crisis after her defense minister resigned in a sexual harassment scandal, leaving the government with “the stench of death” to it, according to an opposition lawmaker.

Patel, a Brexit campaigner who is popular in the governing Conservative Party, was heading back to London after cancelling meetings on a planned trip to Africa to respond to media reports that she failed to declare meetings with Israeli officials in a breach of diplomatic protocol.

Asked whether Patel should be dismissed, the new defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, told reporters in Brussels: “The prime minister makes her own decision on actually who is serving in her cabinet, and they’re only the prime minister’s decisions.”

Under British protocol, a cabinet minister would normally organize meetings through the foreign office and be accompanied by officials, and visits with Israelis would typically be balanced with meetings with Palestinians. Patel was also reported to have visited the Golan Heights, territory disputed between Israel and Syria, which British officials tend to avoid.

Whether Patel is sacked or not, the scandal is the latest to rattle May, who is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party in parliament to make laws - increasingly important as Britain navigates its departure from the European Union.

She lost close ally Michael Fallon, her defense secretary, last week, and her deputy Damian Green and another minister are under investigation as part of the sexual harassment scandal in parliament.

On Tuesday, her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was pressed to apologize over remarks he made about a jailed aid worker in Iran, which critics said could prompt Tehran to hand her a longer jail term.

“STENCH OF DEATH”

Opposition lawmakers are openly questioning whether May has the strength to continue as prime minister.

“There are times when a government has the stench of death about it,” Pat McFadden, a lawmaker from the main opposition Labour Party, told parliament on Tuesday.

Patel apologized to May on Monday for failing to report that she had met senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a holiday.

On Wednesday, the Sun newspaper reported that she had also failed to disclose that she had met the director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Yuval Rotem, in New York and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan in London.

A government source confirmed those meetings took place.

The source said that no UK government officials were present for the discussions, and they were set up and reported in a way that did not accord with the usual procedures.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper also reported that Patel visited a field hospital of the Israeli Defence Forces in the Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war.

A spokesman for May denied that the prime minister had been aware of Patel’s meeting with Netanyahu in advance.

“It is not true that the prime minister knew about the International Development Secretary’s meeting with PM Netanyahu before Friday Nov. 3,” the spokesman said.",Further blow to Britain's May as aid minister's future in doubt,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-patel/further-blow-to-may-as-aid-ministers-future-in-doubt-idUKKBN1D80OT?il=0

Crux, which has teams in New York and San Francisco, will use the funding to expand its business and hire more staff, it said on Wednesday.

Goldman Sachs invested through its Principal Strategic Investments division, which backs young financial technology companies.

Financial firms recently have become more interested in utilizing large and diverse sets of data to inform their business strategies.

While appetite for so-called “big data” has grown, many institutions still spend much of their time scrubbing and formatting the data to make it usable, rather than analyzing it through sophisticated techniques such as artificial intelligence.

Often the same data set will be processed multiple times by different firms.

“The emergence of unstructured data as an important input into the investment process creates a great opportunity for financial institutions, but only if actionable insights can be extrapolated from it,” Darren Cohen, global head of Goldman Sachs’ Principal Strategic Investments group, said in a statement.

Crux’s platform processes the data for financial firms, including banks, hedge funds, private equity groups and insurers, so they can focus resources on carrying out more differentiating tasks such as building artificial intelligence algorithms to extract value from the information.

This removes the biggest pain point, or “crux” of data analytics in finance, said Philip Brittan, chief executive of Crux.

“Everyone is looking at how to get more data and how to get more value out of the data that they have,” Brittan said in an interview. But “firms spend the majority of their data time on stuff that is not differentiated,” he added.

Crux does not sell or resell the data, but has established a network of information suppliers to help clients discover new sources.

The company started operations almost a year ago and signed up its first clients in the summer, Brittan said.

Other strategic investors participated in the funding round, he added, but did not disclose their names.

The investment underscores how large financial institutions are increasingly turning to young fintech startups for help in dealing with some pressing needs, from managing and analyzing data to running more efficient compliance processes.",Goldman Sachs leads $10 million investment round in data startup Crux,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crux-goldman-sachs/goldman-sachs-leads-10-million-investment-round-in-data-startup-crux-idUSKBN1D81PY?il=0

Uma das propostas sobre a mesa, segundo uma das fontes, seria a manutenção do abono apenas para quem ganha um salário mínimo, o que poderia gerar economia de cerca de 20 bilhões de reais em um ano. Para ter acesso ao benefício hoje, o trabalhador precisa ter recebido remuneração mensal média de até dois salários mínimos durante o ano-base.

Instituído por lei de 1990, o abono equivale a um valor de, no máximo, um salário mínimo ao ano para os beneficiários.

As fontes ressaltaram, contudo, que medidas nesse sentido dariam fôlego de curto prazo, mas não diminuiriam a necessidade de mudanças estruturais nas regras para concessão de aposentadorias.

Em estudo divulgado em abril, a Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Econômico (OCDE) já havia destacado a necessidade de revisão do benefício, estimando que sua limitação a quem ganha um salário mínimo reduziria em 80 por cento os recursos gastos com o abono, atualmente na casa de 0,3 por cento do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB).

As discussões sobre de esforços adicionais para equacionar o desequilíbrio nas contas públicas têm ganhado força diante do impasse na reforma da Previdência.

O governo enfrenta dificuldades políticas para conseguir passar a matéria no Congresso Nacional, tanto pela aproximação do ano eleitoral de 2018 quanto pelo desgaste político após Temer ter negociado com a base para segurar denúncias contra ele.

Nesta manhã, o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, afirmou que não há decisão concreta sobre a estratégia para votação do texto e que o governo segue empenhado em conversas com lideranças parlamentares para aprovação das alterações ainda neste ano.

Praticamente no mesmo momento, o deputado Darcísio Perondi (PMDB-RS), um dos vice-líderes do governo na Câmara, disse que a base governista vai apresentar uma emenda substitutiva para a reforma, acrescentando que há relativo consenso em relação à idade mínima, mas o tempo de contribuição ainda vai ser discutido.

O governo tem investido no corpo a corpo com parlamentares para tentar aprovar mudanças na Previdência, mesmo que mais brandas do que o originalmente pensado, especialmente depois de Temer ter reconhecido na noite de segunda-feira a possibilidade de derrota na votação da proposta.

Thick smog swathed Delhi, where pollution readings in some places peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government’s air quality index that measures poisonous particles.

“The air quality in Delhi is deteriorating. We cannot compromise with the health of children at this stage,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, ordering the closure until Sunday.

The Delhi administration, which described the city as a “gas chamber”, had previously ordered schools for young children to close only for Wednesday.

India’s federal health ministry also advised people with breathing problems and children to remain indoors.

“People should avoid morning walk or any other strenuous outdoor activity that increases breathing rate,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

Anti-pollution measures adopted by the Delhi state government in recent years include limiting car use and taxing trucks that pass through the city, but few have succeeded.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s federal government also urged Delhi and the surrounding northern states to immediately tackle dangerous levels of pollution in the capital, even if that meant deploying helicopters to spray jets of water.

“Every possible step required to tackle the situation has been already identified, and the need of the hour is to put them into action,” federal Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan wrote on social network Twitter, using the hashtag “#DelhiSmog”.

Vardhan also urged the surrounding states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to ban burning on farms, which is seen as a major contributor to the dirty air, along with high vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites.

EMERGENCY MEASURES

The Delhi government said it had sought meetings with state ministers to discuss the burning, provoking protest from many who saw the measure as being too little and too late.

“Nobody seems to get the gravity of the problem,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, the chairman and managing director of the Medanta Heart Institute.

Last November, the city’s worst pollution in nearly 20 years forced about a million children to miss school, while thousands of workers reported sick and people queued to buy face masks.

Residents are worried this year as well. The Indian Medical Association has urged organizers to call off Delhi’s biggest race set for Nov. 19, to protect runners and volunteers.

If pollution increases, emergency measures, such as the suspension of construction activity, will kick in, the Delhi government has said.

Long-term measures, such as improving public transport and banning the use of dirty industry fuel, are required, said Anumita Roychowdhury of New Delhi’s Centre for Science and Environment.

“Without the systemic changes, the scope and impact of the emergency measures will be limited,” she added.

The thick blanket of smog caused a major vehicle pile-up on a busy highway on the outskirts of Delhi, Indian media reported.

High pollution levels were driving a major surge for air purifiers in capital New Delhi and its suburbs, Amazon.com Inc’s India unit said.

Air purifier sales have surged 150 percent, along with a 260 percent increase in demand for face masks this year, Amazon said, adding that air purifier sales have risen 600 percent in the last month.","Delhi schools shut for rest of week as toxic smog thickens, chokes",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/delhi-schools-shut-for-rest-of-week-as-toxic-smog-thickens-chokes-idINKBN1D80ZG

Using 3D technology, the Scan Pyramids Project allows visitors wearing headsets to take a guided tour inside the Grand Gallery, the Queen’s Chamber and other ancient rooms not normally accessible to the public, without leaving Paris.

“Thanks to this technique, we make it possible to teleport ourselves to Egypt, inside the pyramid, as a group and with a guide,” said Mehdi Tayoubi, co-director of Scan Pyramids, which on Nov. 2 announced the discovery of a mysterious space inside the depths of the Pyramid.

The void itself is visible on the tour, appearing like a dotted cloud.

“What is new in the world of virtual reality is that from now on you are not isolated but there are several of us, you’re in a group, you can take a tour with your family. And you can access places which you usually can’t in the real pyramid.”

While partly designed as a fun experience, the “collaborative immersion” project allows researchers to improve the technologies they used to detect the pyramid void and think about what purpose it may have served.

The pyramid, built in around 2,500 BC and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a monumental tomb soaring to a height of 479 feet (146 metres). Until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889, the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest manmade structure for more than 4,000 years.

While there are passage ways into it and chambers in various parts, much of the internal structure had remained a mystery until a team from France’s HIP Institute used an imaging method based on cosmic rays to gain a view inside.

So-called muon particles, which originate from interactions with rays from space and atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, are able to penetrate hundreds of metres through stone before being absorbed. That allows for mapping inside stone structures.

“Muon tomography has really improved a lot due to its use on the pyramid and we think that muography will have other applications in other fields,” said Tayoubi. “But we also wanted to innovate and imagine devices to allow the wider public to understand what this pyramid is, understand it from within.”

When looking through their 3D goggles, visitors can see the enormous stones of the pyramid as if they were real, and walk virtually along its corridors, chambers and hidden spaces.

Ross was speaking at a signing ceremony in the Chinese capital for commercial deals worth about $9 billion on Trump’s visit.

Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of China’s massive trade surplus with the U.S. - calling it “embarrassing” and “horrible” last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices, fuelling worries of increased tension between the world’s two largest trading countries.

“Addressing the imbalance in China trade has been the central focus of collaborative discussions between President Trump and President Xi and achieving fair and reciprocal treatment for the companies is a shared objective,” Ross said.

Data on Wednesday showed China’s exports to the U.S. rose 8.3 percent in October on the year, while imports grew 4.3 percent. That led to a trade surplus of $26.62 billion with the U.S. last month, down from September’s record $28.08 billion, but higher than recent trends.

Deals signed on Wednesday included a pledge by Chinese ecommerce company JD.com to buy more than $2 billion of food products from the U.S. over three years and a pact for Reignwood International to buy additional helicopters from U.S. firm Bell Helicopter.

While 19 deals were signed on Wednesday, some in the U.S. business community have expressed worry that contract wins could come at the expense of resolving long-standing complaints over market access restrictions in China.

At the ceremony, China’s vice premier Wang Yang said deals signed between China and U.S. firms would “contribute to the stabilization of the general and overall economic relations between the two countries”.

The ceremony was a prelude to a “more important” signing ceremony set for Thursday, he added. Among the companies expected to sign deals on Thursday are Qualcomm, Boeing and Goldman Sachs.

Canada’s new three-year immigration plan, unveiled on Wednesday, will see it increase its immigration intake by 13 percent over three years to help meet the needs of an aging population.

But the increase is below that recommended by a government advisory council in 2016, which had wanted the figure to rise by 50 percent over five years.

“It’s easy to bring somebody in, it’s another thing to make sure they succeed in Canada,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said by telephone from Ottawa.

Canada’s immigration system focuses on bringing in skilled workers, but has struggled to connect them with job opportunities in keeping with their skills and credentials.

The immigration minister, himself a former refugee from Somalia, said bringing newcomers to Canada was only “half of the job,” and that supports were needed to ensure they integrated well into society.

Canada has resettled more than 40,000 Syrian refugees since 2015 and seen more than 15,000 asylum seekers walk across its border with the United States this year, with many saying they fear a U.S. immigration crackdown.

Many of the latter group have gone to Quebec, sparking an anti-immigrant backlash in the French-speaking province. The military set up a tent encampment to house asylum seekers while they are processed.

Both Hussen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau say they are wary of anti-immigrant sentiment in Canada.

“I think in Canada we’re lucky that, broadly speaking, we have support (but) it’s not consensus, there are people who oppose immigration,” Hussen said.

Canada isn’t “some magical place that doesn’t have worries about immigration, worries about security, worries about division and intolerant minds,” Trudeau said at a Toronto conference on Thursday.

Trudeau made international headlines in January with tweets touting Canada’s welcome of refugees, coinciding with U.S. President Donald Trump’s first travel ban.

But two years after mobilizing the country to bring in Syrians, the Canadian government is dialing down its involvement. About 30 percent of resettled refugees in the next three years will be government-sponsored, compared with 46 percent in the previous three years.

“Look, we can’t take every refugee from the world,” Hussen said. “What we can do is we can play our part.”

Hussen said Canada offered to resettle some of the more than 600,000 Rohingya refugees who have fled their homes in Myanmar for neighboring Bangladesh, but was told by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees that was not necessary.

Jean-Nicolas Beuze, the UNHCR’s Canadian representative, said the agency is focused on providing for the immediate needs of Rohingya refugees, with an eventual return to their homes in Myanmar as the “best solution.”

Canada’s three-year immigration plan would see immigration rise by 40,000 to 340,000 people annually in 2020. That is below an increase to 450,000 by 2021 recommended by the advisory council, to offset an aging population and strains on the social safety net.",Canada to take in migrants at 'gradual' pace amid integration concerns,https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1D22N3-OCADN

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do. Two people briefed on the talks told Reuters the government has sought as long as 10 years for such conditions while AT&T has pressed for a shorter period.",AT&T says timing of Time Warner deal completion now uncertain,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-time-warner-m-a/att-says-timing-of-time-warner-deal-completion-now-uncertain-idUKKBN1D81VN

Tel Aviv-based Corephotonics Ltd filed its patent infringement case against Apple in federal court in San Jose, California, on Monday.

Corephotonics, which has raised $50 million from several high-profile venture capital firms and other investors, said its patented dual camera technology for mobile devices was incorporated by Apple in the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus without its authorization.

According to the lawsuit, Corephotonics Chief Executive David Mendlovic approached Apple about a partnership. Apple praised the start-up’s technology but refused to license it, Corephotonics said, even suggesting it could infringe the latter’s patents with little consequence.

According to the complaint, “Apple’s lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics’ patents, telling Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something.”

An Apple spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

Many high-end smartphones include dual camera systems that can zoom in without losing image quality. Apple has its own patents on dual camera technology.

Through its latest funding round in January, Corephotonics raised $15 million from investors that included Samsung Ventures, electronics manufacturer Foxconn and chipmaker MediaTek Inc.

Foxconn is one of Apple’s contract manufacturers. Apple is considering MediaTek as a chip supplier, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Corephotonics’ other investors include Magma VC, Amiti Ventures, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Solina Chau’s Horizon Ventures, as well as flash storage maker SanDisk and Chinese telephone services provider CK Telecom.

Corephotonics is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, the law firm that advised Samsung Electronics Co on its patent litigation with Apple.

Federer will kick off the tournament, which has been held in London’s 02 Arena since 2009, against Sock on Sunday with Zverev facing Cilic in the later session.

Nadal will start on Monday against Goffin, giving him an extra day to test the knee which forced him to withdraw from the Paris Masters.

Zverev, 20, has taken men’s tennis by storm this year, rocketing up to number three in the world rankings after winning five titles, including two Masters 1000 events.

“It’s an honor to play there in London, it’s my first time and hopefully not my last,” Zverev said in Milan where he took part in an exhibition match at the Next Gen Finals, having dropped out to concentrate on London.

“I will try to prepare myself as well as I can and try to win many matches there.”

He is one of three first-timers with Dimitrov finally qualifying after being long-predicted to become a regular member of the men’s elite. Sock is the first American to qualify since Mardy Fish did so in 2011.

Goffin has qualified for the first time also, although last year he played a match as an alternate.

The draw, which took place on BBC Radio, was delayed because Boris Becker, who Nadal’s group is named after, was held up by traffic on his way to the studio.

Groundbreaking on new homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 222,771 starts in October, bucking expectations for a decline to a 210,000 annual rate and marking five straight months of starts above the 200,000 unit threshold.

September starts were also revised slightly higher

The construction was driven by a 12.5 percent increase in multiple urban starts - typically condos - which offset a 17.1 percent drop in single urban starts, the report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp showed.

The condo market has held strength in both Toronto and Vancouver, Canada’s two largest markets, despite a broader slowdown in overall sales amid rising mortgage rates and a foreign buyers tax imposed in the two cities.

The 12-month tally of multiple starts is the highest since at least 1990, BMO Capital Markets senior economist Robert Kavcic said in a research note.

“Canadian homebuilding activity remains rock solid, backed by demographic support,” Kavcic said, noting that 2017 is on track for the largest number of new units in a decade.

CIBC Economics economist Nick Exarhos said the mild October weather benefited builders.

“All told, the run up in starts through 2017 is a positive omen for residential investment, although already elevated levels of activity mean that there isn’t much room for housing to become more of a positive for the growth outlook,” Exarhos said in a note to clients.

A separate report by Statistics Canada showed the value of Canadian building permits increased 3.8 percent in September, the first rise in three months, on strength in the non-residential sector.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the value of permits to drop by 0.2 percent.

Permits in the non-residential sector jumped 13.9 percent, largely thanks to a permit for a hospital in the western province of Alberta.

Permits in the residential sector declined 1.7 percent from August, the third consecutive month-on-month retreat, on lower construction intentions for apartments in Ontario.

Kavcic said the number of residential units permitted has been steadily fading since peaking in June.

“Given that there’s some lag between permit issuance and projects breaking ground, we could see starts settle back down somewhat in the latter stages of the year,” Kavcic said.","Canada housing starts, building permits rise unexpectedly",https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1D81T8-OCABS

Carles Puigdemont’s secessionist alliance was threatening to unravel, with the region’s biggest grass-roots independence organisation unhappy about his plan. So he called a meeting of political allies on the eve of his departure for Brussels, according to three sources with first-hand knowledge of the events.

In the rural hamlet of Vilahur, near Puigdemont’s home town, he and seven others, including the deputy chief of the grass-roots Catalan National Assembly (ANC), met over dinner at a farmhouse in the expectation Puigdemont and others present would be arrested for rebellion within hours, one source said.

Puigdemont told the group he was not running away from a fight, as ANC officials feared it would be perceived, and that he would use Brussels, home to the EU parliament and commission, as a stage to continue to speak out against Spain’s crackdown on the independence movement, the source added.

After adjourning for the night, the group resumed the next morning at the farmhouse and agreed to back his plan. Crucially, that plan also included a commitment to contest snap regional elections called by Madrid for Dec. 21 rather than boycott them as the ANC first envisaged.

On reaching agreement, Puigdemont told them he was prepared to “spend 30 years in prison” for the cause and the others embraced him in what the source described as an emotional farewell. ANC deputy leader Agusti Alcoberro was among them.

The account of the meeting reveals how the independence movement’s leadership managed to overcome deep-rooted internal divisions and agree a rough game plan for the weeks ahead. While the two main pro-independence parties finally chose on Tuesday to contest the elections under their own brand rather than a joint ticket, their manifestos will be coordinated and they are still expected to join forces after the vote.

An opinion poll this week showed that pro-independence parties would win the largest share of the vote, though a majority was not assured and question marks remain over Puigdemont’s leadership of the pro-independence cause. Puigdemont could not be reached for comment.

WRONG-FOOTED

At the time of the Vilahur talks, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy seemed to hold the upper hand. He had surprised the secessionists by calling elections much sooner than they had expected, according to sources close to Puigdemont.

A disparate collection of parties whose only common thread is independence, Puigdemont’s coalition had been bickering over what some saw as his timid tactics. Some had even been talking of boycotting the election, which could have spelled the end of the movement.

“He was wrong-footed by Rajoy’s tough response,” said an ally of Puigdemont.

When Rajoy dropped his election bombshell, Puigdemont was still celebrating the regional assembly’s vote earlier that day to declare Catalonia a republic.

The Catalan leader had to move quickly to secure consensus for the Brussels plan and, more importantly, for his unwieldy coalition to contest the elections, which had been called by a nation they no longer considered themselves to be a part of.

In Puigdemont’s first meeting late on Oct. 27, in Barcelona’s regional parliament building, the coalition decided that only a few ministers would go with him to Brussels and the rest would stay and defend themselves against any prosecution for sedition, said sources briefed on that meeting.

Afterwards, he drove to Girona, the town he had run as mayor. In a courtyard of a government building, he filmed a message calling for non-violent opposition to Rajoy’s takeover of the region. It was televised by Catalan public broadcaster TV3 which called him “president”.

Later, he lunched with his wife and two friends at a local wine bar and walked with them to Girona’s Placa de la Independencia (Independence Square) where he posed for photos while applauding onlookers shouted “Long Live Catalonia”.

Despite the defiant scene, the day was not going well for the newly declared Catalan republic.

Rajoy was receiving backing from world powers including France, Germany and the United States. Spanish authorities were already taking over Catalan government offices.

THE FLEMISH CONNECTION

However, Puigdemont got some news that appeared to justify his Brussels strategy just as he and four of his ex-ministers were making their way there.

Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, said that if Puigdemont were to seek political asylum in Belgium, it would be “not unrealistic” to grant it. Belgium is one of few EU states where EU citizens can request asylum.

Francken belongs to Flemish nationalist party N-VA, which is supportive of Catalan self-determination. He said no asylum request had yet been made but events were “moving fast”.

Puigdemont was meanwhile in a friend’s car heading for Marseilles, southern France, where he would board a flight to Brussels. To elude Spanish police, someone drove his official car in a different direction.

Since arriving in Brussels, Puigdemont and the four ex-ministers who accompanied him there have been slapped with European arrest warrants for rebellion and sedition, crimes carrying up to 30 years in jail.

Back in Spain, eight other ex-ministers have been jailed pending an investigation and potential trial for rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.

Puigdemont has not sought asylum but is at liberty in Belgium pending a hearing on extradition, which his lawyer has said he will oppose.",Insight: Catalan leader's farmhouse pact to make last stand in Brussels,https://in.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-catalonia-puigdemont/insight-catalan-leaders-farmhouse-pact-to-make-last-stand-in-brussels-idINKBN1D81C1

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

Addressing supporters at the headquarters of his ZANU-PF party in Harare, 93-year-old Mugabe accused Emmerson Mnangagwa of consulting witchdoctors and prophets as part of a campaign to secure the presidency.

Mnangagwa said he had fled Zimbabwe because of death threats and was safe.

“My sudden departure was caused by incessant threats on my person, life and family by those who have attempted before through various forms of elimination including poisoning,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.

The head of the influential war veterans association, Chris Mutsvangwa, said that Mnangagwa, who was sacked on Monday, would travel to Johannesburg in neighboring South Africa “very soon”.

Mugabe said Mnangagwa, nicknamed “Crocodile”, had made the same mistakes as Joice Mujuru, who was the president’s deputy for 10 years until she was fired in 2014.

“You should not try to say because the journey is long, then I should take a short cut to arrive quickly. The road has lions. There are pitfalls. There is death, beware,” he said.

“...There is no short cut to being the leader of the people. Just as there was no short cut to our independence.”

ZANU-PF would move to discipline Mnangagwa’s “co-conspirators”, Mugabe added.

ZANU-PF’s executive politburo is expected to decide at a meeting on Wednesday whether to fire Mnangagwa and his allies from the party.

Mnangagwa has not been seen in public since his dismissal from government but his ally Mutsvangwa said he was “safe and beyond the reach of the assassins”.

Mutsvangwa ruled out trying to remove Mugabe by force and said war veterans, who had publicly backed Mnangagwa and broke ranks with the president last year, would form a broad front with the opposition in elections next year.

“We don’t want to abuse the military to resolve a political problem. We don’t want them to become the arbiter of political power,” Mutsvangwa said.

He was critical of Mugabe’s wife Grace, who looks set to become vice president after a special ZANU-PF congress in December. “This is a coup by marriage certificate ....and it will be resisted,” he said.",Zimbabwe's Mugabe: Beware of death on road to presidency,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D825B

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do.

“We already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,” REC chief executive Kevin Green said.

“We therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.”

Britain’s official statistics agency said in August that net migration fell to its lowest level in three years with more than half the drop caused by European Union citizens leaving and fewer arriving since the Brexit vote.

REC said its survey, conducted with data firm IHS Markit, showed the availability of permanent and temporary workers continued to fall sharply last month.

So far, there is little sign that the pressure on salaries detected by REC for workers hired via recruitment agencies is filtering through into the rest of the labour market, despite unemployment falling to its lowest level since the 1970s.

Average weekly earnings are rising by just over 2 percent a year, below the rate of inflation which has hit 3 percent.

Der Währungsraum müsse auch einen Finanzrahmen für Investitionen und Hilfen für angeschlagene Euro-Staaten erhalten, sagte Wirtschafts- und Finanzminister Bruno Le Maire am Mittwoch auf einer “Handelsblatt”-Konferenz in Berlin. Le Maire trifft sich in Berlin auch mit dem Parteichef der FDP, Christian Lindner, Grünen-Chef Cem Özdemir sowie dem geschäftsführenden Finanzminister Peter Altmaier.

Die Euro-Zonen-Reformen gehören auch in den Jamaika-Sondierungsgesprächen zwischen CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen zu den umstrittenen Punkten. Le Maire warnte, dass Stillstand in der Euro-Zone Rückschritt bedeute. Es gebe jetzt eine einzigartige Gelegenheit, eine “Boom-Zeit” für Deutschland, Frankreich und die EU einzuläuten. Dazu müsse aber etwa die Euro-Zone sattelfester gemacht werden und die Europäer geeint und nicht naiv auftreten, um ihre Interessen gegenüber den USA und China durchzusetzen.

Deutsch-französische Arbeitsgruppen sollten nach Le Maires Vorstellung die Reformen jetzt im wöchentlichen Rhythmus vorantreiben. Der französische Finanzminister warnte vor Stereotypen in der Debatte. Die Regierung von Präsident Emmanuel Macron sei fest entschlossen, in den kommenden fünf Jahren die Schulden und das Haushaltsdefizit Frankreichs zurückzuführen. Niemand in Paris habe die Erwartung, dass Europa die nötigen Reformen in der Arbeitslosenversicherung oder im Bildungssystem in Frankreich durchführe. “Wir werden das EU-Defizitverfahren hinter uns lassen”, sagte er mit Blick auf das nach wie vor hohe Haushaltsdefizit. Niemand müsse zudem Angst haben, dass Frankreich Deutschland für seine Schulden und Probleme zahlen lassen wolle, fügte Le Maire angesichts entsprechender Warnungen etwa aus der FDP hinzu.

WIDERSTAND GEGEN EURO-ZONEN-BUDGET IN JAMAIKA-SONDIERUNGEN

Bei den Jamaika-Sondierungen hatte sich bereits gezeigt, dass es parteiübergreifenden Widerstand gegen ein Euro-Zonen-Budget gibt. Die FDP deutete aber bereits an, dass sie etwa ihren Widerstand gegen die Weiterentwicklung des Euro-Rettungsmechanismus in einen Europäischen Währungsfonds aufgeben könnte. Le Maire warb erneut für einen Geldtopf innerhalb der Euro-Zone, aus dem Investitionen bezahlt werden sollten. Dies könne auch die Bereiche Forschung und Bildung betreffen. Die französische Regierung glaube, dass zudem ein Unterstützungsinstrument für angeschlagene Euro-Staaten innerhalb der Euro-Zone sinnvoll sei. Denn die Finanzkrise habe gezeigt, dass es alle betreffe, wenn ein Euro-Land in Probleme gerate. Ein solcher “Schock-Absorber” wird in Berlin aber skeptisch gesehen.

Bei der Weiterentwicklung der Euro-Zone sei es als erster Schritt wichtig, die Banken- und Kapitalunion zu vollenden, sagte Le Maire. Er wisse, dass dies angesichts der Vorbehalte etwa der Sparkassen und des Bundestages in Deutschland schwierig sei. Man müsse aber die Probleme etwa angesichts des unterschiedlichen Konkurs-Rechts in beiden Ländern überwinden und bis Jahresende zu einer gemeinsamen deutsch-französischen Lösung zur Körperschaftssteuer kommen. In Deutschland gibt es Bedenken gegen eine gemeinsame europäische Haftung etwa bei den Bankeneinlagen.

Le Maire forderte zudem erneut einen Euro-Finanzminister und eine parlamentarische Kontrollinstanz für die angedachten Euro-Zonen-Instrumente innerhalb der Währungsunion.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

Talks between conservatives, Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) resumed on Monday after Chancellor Angela Merkel convened a weekend meeting to clear the air between ideologically diverse parties forced by electoral arithmetic into awkward partnership.

“The weekend pause for thought did us good,” said Andreas Scheuer, a leader in the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU). Other party leaders agreed.

But Monday’s talks, on education, digitalization, pensions and labor issues, as well as domestic security, were always expected to be less contentious than the immigration, fiscal and climate policies that divided them last week.

One sign of the division came in an interview Merkel ally Peter Altmaier gave to the newspaper Die Zeit, where he shot down media reports about a reshuffling of ministerial portfolios. Der Spiegel magazine reported the FDP might head a weakened finance ministry, with key European affairs functions hived off to another ministry.

Negotiators emerged on Monday with a document spelling out areas where they had reached agreement, including commitments to universal gigabit-speed internet by 2025, and spending 3.5 percent of economic output on research and development.

After discussions that ran late into the evening, they also signed up to Merkel’s election campaign pledge of achieving full employment, without giving a specific target date.

Merkel, whose conservatives came first but lost seats in the Sept. 24 national elections must forge a so-called “Jamaica” coalition - named because the three camps’ colors match that country’s flag - that is untested at national level.

Almost 10 percent of China’s refining capacity is set to be shut down during the third quarter, signaling that demand growth from the world’s top crude importer is stuttering further.

West African and European suppliers are already feeling the chill from China’s reduced demand, and a global glut has dragged spot prices for crude this week to their lowest since November, 2016.

Major Chinese oil refineries, including PetroChina’s Jinzhou will set their run rates around 6,500 barrels per day (bpd) lower than the second quarter, sources at the affected refineries said.

Petrochina’s Fushun refinery, with an annual capacity of 233,200 bpd, began a 45-day full shutdown at the start of June, the sources said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to media.

Rival Sinopec is considering slashing as much as 230,000 bpd, equivalent to about 5 percent of its average daily production last year, in what would be only the second time in 16 years that the firm has cut runs.

Stocks of surplus products like gasoline and diesel have been building since mid-2015, when Beijing started giving out crude import licenses to independent refiners, sometimes called teapots. This has forced state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina to cut back operations, and reduced their crude buying.

“Refiners probably realized that the domestic market cannot take so much gasoline and diesel, and the only way is to cut runs,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Adding to these cuts, around 1.3 million bpd of refining capacity is going to shut in the third quarter as four state-run refineries and six independents begin planned maintenance, data provided by China Sublime Information Group showed.

Those closures mean almost 10 percent of China’s 15.1 million bpd total refining capacity will go offstream in the third quarter.

To whittle down the surplus weighing on the domestic market, analysts expect China to export refined product, putting more pressure on a well supplied global markets.

“China will have to export product... onto Asian markets, which given demand conditions regionally does not appear particularly constructive,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity strategy at French bank BNP Paribas.

FILE PHOTO: Employees close a valve of a pipe at a PetroChina refinery in Lanzhou, Gansu province January 7, 2011. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo

The lower refinery throughput should reduce China’s demand for crude until around September. Some suppliers are already feeling the chill. Shipments by Angola, which sends most its oil to China, were running at the lowest level in at least a year during the first few weeks of June.

From the North Sea, just 2 million barrels of Forties crude has been shipped to Asia so far this month, compared with around 6 million barrels in June last year, and 10 million barrels in May.

BUT DON‘T WRITE CHINA OFF

The imminent cuts in China’s refining sector are likely to further weigh on oil prices, which have more than halved since 2014 due to oversupply.

However, traders say that China’s voracious thirst for oil will likely return once the immediate glut is cleared.

Nineteen Chinese independent refiners this week received fresh licenses to import crude for 2017.

“I’d expect improved buying now that teapot quotas have been released. If prices drop, China tends to buy more,” said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for Strong Petroleum, a trading firm supplying Chinese refiners.

Taken together with the licenses awarded earlier, independent refiners now have import quotas for about 1.42 million bpd this year, and it is possible that eight companies will receive allocations for another 340,000 bpd.

As refiners start chartering tankers to import crude, the impact of the new import allowances is expected to show from the end of the third quarter.

Traders said they will meet much of this demand by re-selling crude stored in South Korea and China, particularly from Shandong province where most of the independent refiners are, and from tankers off Malaysia.

Some traders even expect demand to spike in the fourth quarter, as seen late last year as teapots rushed to use up quotas to build their case for maintaining or increasing future quota allocations.

“China is a bit unpredictable – suddenly they buy a lot out of the blue, so you can never underestimate China’s buying,” said Berentsen.",Looming Chinese refinery cuts to hit oil demand,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-oil-demand-analysis/looming-chinese-refinery-cuts-to-hit-oil-demand-idUSKBN19C168

Vehicles of every sort already are starting to add wireless chips to download everything from maps to entertainment, and in a few years nearly every new car may be connected. Self-driving cars, still in test mode, will accelerate the move.

“The amount of chips per car is going to grow dramatically,” said Egil Juliussen, a principal analyst for automotive technology at IHSMarkit.

Chip makers are scrambling to create new mobile networks, the so-called fifth generation, which will link phones as well as cars, drones and even industrial devices such as smart street lights, which count pedestrians and send data to city planners.

Qualcomm long was the dominant communications chip maker for mobile phones, although computer chip maker Intel has begun muscling into the space. Each now supplies about half Apple Inc’s iPhone communications chips, for instance.

Now they are jockeying in a mature market to design so-called 5G networks that will be up to 10 times as fast as wireless networks today, which are expected to start rolling out in 2020. Research firm IDC predicts 1.53 billion smart phones will be shipped in 2017 expanding to only 1.77 billion units in 2021.

The market for modem chips for cars, by contrast, is expected to grow sharply. Tristan Gerra, a senior semiconductor analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co, said that this year, only about 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured per year have internet connectivity. But connectivity will become ubiquitous on self-driving cars.

“You basically (will) have 80 million units per year that are going to get a modem,” he said.

Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment.

Qualcomm itself is trying to buy NXP Semiconductors, a maker of automotive chips from so-called “infotainment” system chips to camera systems, for $38 billion. It is unclear whether that deal will go through and whether Broadcom would take on NXP, but Broadcom has said it is willing to do so.

A tie-up between the three companies could create a formidable competitor in the automotive chip space, said IHSMarkit’s Juliussen. He views Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place.

Intel has bought itself into relationships with autonomous car developers thanks to its acquisition of vision system maker Mobileye. Broadcom would get something similar with NXP, Juliussen said.

If Broadcom pulls off both deals, its market position in some areas could be dominant, said Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman.

“[Broadcom] would basically own the majority of the high-end components in the smart phone market and they would have a very significant influence on 5G standards, which are paramount as you think about autonomous vehicles” and connected factories, he said.",Qualcomm buy may pit Broadcom against Intel in 'connected car' fight,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom-intel/qualcomm-buy-may-pit-broadcom-against-intel-in-connected-car-fight-idUKKBN1D81CP

In a specially equipped pen, sheep were shown pictures of people on two computer screens, on one side would be an unknown person and on the other would be one of four celebrities.

The animal would receive a reward of food for choosing the photograph of the celebrity by breaking an infrared beam near the screen displaying it. If they chose the wrong photograph, a buzzer would sound and they would receive no reward.

The sheep eventually managed to identify the familiar face eight times out of every 10.

The group of celebrities the sheep were trained to recognize included actors Emma Watson and Jake Gyllenhaal, BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce and Obama.

“We’ve shown that sheep have advanced face-recognition abilities, comparable with those of humans and monkeys,” Professor Jenny Morton, who led the study, said in a statement.

In addition to being shown images of the celebrities facing forward, scientists also tested the animals’ ability to recognize the faces in photographs taken from other angles.

The animals’ success rate fell by around 15 percent when presented with the faces at a new angle, an amount researchers said was comparable to that seen when humans perform the task.

The play, which first premiered in London’s National theatre in 1983, charts two days in the life of a group of desperate Chicago real estate salesmen and chronicles the moral compromises they are willing to make in order to make a sale.

For director Sam Yates, whose London revival stars Hollywood actor Christian Slater, the play is an examination of how language is used to control people -- which Yates thinks hits home in the current political climate.

“We have a president in the United States who cut his teeth selling real estate in the 80s,” the director told Reuters.

“The way language is used by these guys in the play, there’s certainly many, many echoes with how you see Trump buying for time or covering up hugely lack of understanding or pushing something or selling something.”

The 1992 film version featured a bravura monologue of sinister masculinity from Alec Baldwin, who won an Emmy this year for his menacing Trump impersonation.

The workplace bullying on display in the play also strikes a chord at a time when Hollywood is experiencing its own scandals of sexual harassment and abuse.

Kevin Spacey, who played an abusive boss in the “Glengarry” film, was fired last week by Netflix from its hit show “House of Cards” after a number of allegations of sexual misconduct.

Slater, who is returning to the London stage more than a decade after an acclaimed run in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, told Reuters that for too long Hollywood has been “sweeping so many things under the carpet and living with these hush-hush little secrets, that everybody kind of knows about but doesn’t really want to do anything about.”

“That era has to come to an end, women and men have to feel comfortable in the workplace, and in every place,” he said.

Former footballer George Weah was initially set to face Vice-President Joseph Boakai on Tuesday to determine who will replace the term-limited Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

A successful vote would be Liberia’s first democratic transfer of power in more than seven decades. But on Monday, the Supreme Court ordered the elections commission to fully examine allegations levelled by Charles Brumskine, who finished third in last month’s first round poll.

The ruling could push back the run-off date by weeks or even result in the first round being re-run.

“Democracy is only as strong as its weakest link and at these moments, our democracy is under assault. Our country’s reputation is under assault, our economy is under stress,” Johnson Sirleaf said in a radio address.

The National Elections Commission (NEC) has said the first round of voting was largely fair, and international observers said they saw no major problems with the poll.

However Brumskine’s complaint cites gross irregularities and accuses NEC officials of fraud, an allegation the body denies.

A growing chorus of parties have voiced support for Brumskine’s case, including Boakai’s ruling Unity Party, which last week accused Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, of trying to influence the vote. She rejected the accusation.

“Allegations, hate speech, inciteful language has been defining what should be a proud moment in our history,” she said on Tuesday. “We politicians must do better ... Historians will look back at this time and judge us by how we conduct ourselves at this critical moment in time.”

Boakai, Brumskine and two other first-round candidates - Alexander Cummings and Benoni Urey - held a meeting in the capital Monrovia on Tuesday.

While they called upon their supporters to remain calm and pledged to respect the law, they also vowed to fight to ensure the credibility of the vote.

“We thought this would be peaceful, transparent, and meet the standard that it would bring dignity to our country,” Boakai said afterward. “Unfortunately the process was peaceful but not transparent, not credible and didn’t represent the will of the Liberian people.”",Liberia's president says 'our democracy is under assault',https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN1D80KN-OZATP

Mixing banking and other commercial activities has traditionally been prohibited in the United States, amid fears customer deposits would be used to fund or subsidize unrelated and potentially risky non-banking business.

Additional restrictions were imposed in the 2010 Dodd Frank Act after some banks’ risky bets during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 endangered their traditional deposit-taking banking businesses.

“Unfortunately, the crisis has been used as an excuse to silence that discussion, even though the evidence and data show that combining banking and commerce had little to do with the cause of the crisis,” Noreika said. “We need to restart that dialogue.”

Noreika on Wednesday said that allowing non-financial companies to run banks could strengthen the banking system by boosting competition and increasing diversity. The OCC is exploring providing a charter specifically for financial technology providers such as payment processor Square Inc (SQ.N).

Noreika cited research by academics that many banks including Wachovia and IndyMac faltered during the crisis even though they had no “exotic” commercial operations.

One of a handful of exceptions to the current restrictions allows non-financial firms to apply for an industrial loan company (ILC) license, which is subject to oversight by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Noreika’s comments are likely to stoke tensions between his agency and the FDIC, which imposed a moratorium on commercial entities seeking these ILC licenses after Wal-Mart applied for one in 2005. Community banks strongly opposed the Wal-Mart application, claiming the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer might use it to expand into other financial services.

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Weakened by losing her party’s majority in a June election, May faces another crisis after her defense minister resigned in a sexual harassment scandal, leaving the government with “the stench of death” to it, according to an opposition lawmaker.

Patel, a Brexit campaigner who is popular in the governing Conservative Party, was heading back to London after cancelling meetings on a planned trip to Africa to respond to media reports that she failed to declare meetings with Israeli officials in a breach of diplomatic protocol.

Asked whether Patel should be dismissed, the new defense secretary, Gavin Williamson, told reporters in Brussels: “The prime minister makes her own decision on actually who is serving in her cabinet, and they’re only the prime minister’s decisions.”

Under British protocol, a cabinet minister would normally organize meetings through the foreign office and be accompanied by officials, and visits with Israelis would typically be balanced with meetings with Palestinians. Patel was also reported to have visited the Golan Heights, territory disputed between Israel and Syria, which British officials tend to avoid.

Whether Patel is sacked or not, the scandal is the latest to rattle May, who is dependent on the support of a small Northern Irish party in parliament to make laws - increasingly important as Britain navigates its departure from the European Union.

She lost close ally Michael Fallon, her defense secretary, last week, and her deputy Damian Green and another minister are under investigation as part of the sexual harassment scandal in parliament.

Opposition lawmakers are openly questioning whether May has the strength to continue as prime minister.

“There are times when a government has the stench of death about it,” Pat McFadden, a lawmaker from the main opposition Labour Party, told parliament on Tuesday.

Patel apologized to May on Monday for failing to report that she had met senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a holiday.

On Wednesday, the Sun newspaper reported that she had also failed to disclose that she had met the director general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry, Yuval Rotem, in New York and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan in London.

A government source confirmed those meetings took place.

The source said that no UK government officials were present for the discussions, and they were set up and reported in a way that did not accord with the usual procedures.

Israel’s Haaretz newspaper also reported that Patel visited a field hospital of the Israeli Defence Forces in the Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war.

A spokesman for May denied that the prime minister had been aware of Patel’s meeting with Netanyahu in advance.

“It is not true that the prime minister knew about the International Development Secretary’s meeting with PM Netanyahu before Friday Nov. 3,” the spokesman said.",Further blow to Britain's May as aid minister's future in doubt,https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-politics-patel/further-blow-to-britains-may-as-aid-ministers-future-in-doubt-idINKBN1D80R9

Il risultato, che include un incremento delle commissioni di gestione del 20% a 150,6 milioni, risente di oneri legati alla partecipazione al Fondo Interbancario e di minori commissioni di performance (8,8 da 27 milioni) e ricavi da trading (4,7 da 11,1 milioni).

Robusta la raccolta del mese di ottobre, pari a 555 milioni, che ha spinto il management a rivedere al rialzo a 6,5 da 5,5 miliardi le stime di afflussi complessivi per il 2017. Il bilancio della raccolta dei primi dieci mesi è infatti di 5,7 miliardi.

Nel corso della conference call con gli analisti l‘AD Gian Maria Mossa ha quantificato per ottobre in 10-11 le commissioni variabili, stimandole in linea con la media del primo semestre nel quarto trimestre “se i mercati si confermano sugli attuali livelli”. Un livello sostenibile di raccolta per l‘anno prossimo e i successivi, ha aggiunto il manager, si colloca a 4 miliardi. “Non vedo ragioni per una forte decelerazione”.

Due analisti, che hanno rilevato alcune voci superiori alle proprie stime, hanno in generale apprezzato la riduzione dei costi operativi a 45,9 milioni (-6,1%).

Mossa ha detto che nel 2017 “i costi saranno vicini alla parte bassa della guidance”, una forchetta di aumento del 2-4%.

CON SAXO CI SARA’ PIENA INTEGRAZIONE

L‘AD ha detto che punta a chiudere la partnership già annunciata con Saxo entro la fine dell‘anno e che l‘accordo sarà operativo nel secondo semestre del 2018.

“Abbiamo in mente una piena integrazione. Vogliamo fare leva sul marchio di Saxo ma vogliamo tenere i nostri clienti”, ha detto Mossa.

Tornando ai risultati gli accantonamenti, aumentati (a 64 da 40,4 milioni) nei nove mesi soprattutto per effetto di un balzo dell‘attività di reclutamento, sono visti a “45, massimo 50 milioni, almeno 20 milioni saranno spostati entro fine anno alla voce commission expenses”, ha precisato l‘AD.

Il margine di interesse è salito nel periodo a 15,5 da 14,7 milioni e quello di intermediazione del periodo si è attestato a 114,2 milioni, in contrazione del 5,3%.

Spurs are currently third on the table, trailing second-placed Manchester United on goal difference and eight points off Manchester City, who have scored 38 goals in 11 league matches.

”I‘m not surprised how well they’ve done, considering how much they’ve spent,“ Rose told Sky Sports. ”You’d like to think a team spending that much is going to be right up there.

A company that sells everything from sugar beet to cheap party dresses has so far made the most of this somewhat odd mix. But its exposure to sugar prices means its valuation is too rich.

People line up outside a store of clothing retailer Primark before its opening in Berlin, July 3, 2014. Thousands of bargain hunters flocked to a new Primark store in the heart of Berlin on Thursday despite a protest by campaigners demanding the Irish chain improves conditions in the factories that produce its budget tops and jeans. REUTERS/Thomas Peter (GERMANY - Tags: BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT) - GM1EA740ARE01

ABF said on Tuesday its full-year operating profit rose 13 percent. Energy efficiencies and higher extraction rates in its sugar business helped, as did an impressive performance in fashion. Primark, the high-street chain that generates a little more than half of the group’s operating profit, is holding up well despite the spiralling costs of inputs and pressure on British consumer spending.

Like-for-like sales growth of 4.5 percent in the United Kingdom, where about half of Primark’s stores are located, suggests the retailer is taking market share from higher-priced rivals like Hennes & Mauritz and Next. That vindicates ABF’s decision not to hike prices for shoppers even though a weaker sterling has increased the cost of sourcing clothes from Asia. And high footfall through its stores means Primark is one of the few fashion names that can still afford to shun margin-damaging online sales.

But its fashion flair cannot compensate for the problems that a sugar dependency is going to cause in the coming year. Chief Executive George Weston said on Tuesday that profit from the sugar division would be hit by a decline in EU prices. The commodity has long been a volatile source of earnings, generating almost half of group operating profit in 2013 but only 3 percent three years later.

With sugar prices now expected to slide, the company’s valuation is increasingly hard to justify. Even after a 3 percent drop in the stock price on Tuesday, ABF shares are trading at 23 times expected earnings for the coming year. That is approaching the 25.7 times commanded by Zara-owner Inditex, a pure fashion company with higher operating margins.

“His illness has intensified, his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day,” Mujahid said in a statement.

“We have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation,” he said.

King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks were kidnapped in August 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the Afghan capital.

Afghan and Western officials believe the men are being held by the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings. They acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern Afghanistan months after the two were taken.

The Taliban statement came around two weeks after Pakistani troops rescued Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlan Coleman from an area near the Afghan border. They had been held by the Haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012.

The play, which first premiered in London’s National theatre in 1983, charts two days in the life of a group of desperate Chicago real estate salesmen and chronicles the moral compromises they are willing to make in order to make a sale.

For director Sam Yates, whose London revival stars Hollywood actor Christian Slater, the play is an examination of how language is used to control people -- which Yates thinks hits home in the current political climate.

“We have a president in the United States who cut his teeth selling real estate in the 80s,” the director told Reuters.

“The way language is used by these guys in the play, there’s certainly many, many echoes with how you see Trump buying for time or covering up hugely lack of understanding or pushing something or selling something.”

The 1992 film version featured a bravura monologue of sinister masculinity from Alec Baldwin, who won an Emmy this year for his menacing Trump impersonation.

The workplace bullying on display in the play also strikes a chord at a time when Hollywood is experiencing its own scandals of sexual harassment and abuse.

Kevin Spacey, who played an abusive boss in the “Glengarry” film, was fired last week by Netflix from its hit show “House of Cards” after a number of allegations of sexual misconduct.

Slater, who is returning to the London stage more than a decade after an acclaimed run in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, told Reuters that for too long Hollywood has been “sweeping so many things under the carpet and living with these hush-hush little secrets, that everybody kind of knows about but doesn’t really want to do anything about.”

“That era has to come to an end, women and men have to feel comfortable in the workplace, and in every place,” he said.

Ross had originally intended to retain his shipping interests following his confirmation in February. But the 79-year-old investor came under criticism after disclosures on Sunday that one of Navigator’s major clients is the Russian gas company Sibur, a firm whose owners include members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

Information about the business ties between Navigator, which operates gas-carrying ships, and Sibur was based on leaked documents from offshore law firm Appleby that are part of the so-called Paradise Papers, which show details of business dealings by wealthy people and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L).

Reuters has not independently verified the documents.

“He began divesting his Navigator interests in May,” the administration official said of Ross. “He is nearing completion of that process.”

An office of government ethics disclosure filed by Ross on June 20 showed that he sold an interest in Navigator valued at $15,001 to $50,000 on May 30.

The official did not provide an explanation for Ross’s divestitures. Ross had owned stakes in the firms through several partnerships.

Ross, a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy, had told U.S. senators during his confirmation hearing in January that his research showed that retention of shipping interests would not present a conflict of interest. U.S. ocean shipping regulation is handled by the Federal Maritime Commission, a separate, independent agency.

Diamond S Shipping, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, operates 33 petroleum product tankers and 12 crude oil tankers operated under the flags of Hong Kong, the Marshall Islands and Malta.

Ross told media on Monday that he had nothing to do with London-based Navigator’s relationship with Sibur and had never met any of Sibur’s owners. These include Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate who is subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions.

With more than 75 percent of the city’s voting precincts reporting, de Blasio, 56, had won nearly 65 percent, a margin of 35 percentage points over his Republican opponent, state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, according to New York City’s Board of Elections.

The New York Times and other media called the race for de Blasio.

De Blasio, who held a comfortable lead in opinion polls leading up to Election Day, had been widely expected to cruise to victory in a city of 8.5 million people dominated by Democratic voters.

A progressive liberal, de Blasio in the past week campaigned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent. Sanders backed de Blasio’s call for a tax hike on city residents earning more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in Albany.

The mayor has positioned himself as one of the most vocal critics of Republican President Donald Trump, who has received strong disapproval ratings from voters in his native city.

Daisy Taberas, 71, who immigrated from Peru 48 years ago, said she voted for de Blasio because of her concerns over Trump’s stance on immigration.

“I like the way (de Blasio) works with children in the schools, and he’s trying to protect the city and he cares about immigration,” Taberas said after casting her ballot at a Manhattan polling site.

As his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has handed the 32-year-old Prince Mohammed more and more power over the past three years, the ambitious young leader has taken on everything from economic reforms to waging war in neighboring Yemen. Here is what you need to know.

ROYAL POLITICS

Prince Mohammed capped his rapid rise to power in June this year by replacing his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, widely known as MbN, as crown prince.

A source close to King Salman said MbN’s dismissal was “in the higher interests of the state” because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction, a legacy of an assassination attempt that left shrapnel in his body.

Reuters could not independently confirm MbN’s addiction issues.

ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN

Prince Mohammed tightened his grip on power with the start of the anti-corruption campaign at the weekend, purging the kingdom’s political and business elite. Among those arrested were 11 princes.

Many Saudis welcomed the moves as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds by the powerful. U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years” but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh’s opaque tribal and royal politics.

YEMEN

Prince Mohammed launched a military campaign in neighboring Yemen in March 2015. A Saudi-led coalition, acting on an invitation from the internationally-recognized government, has targeted the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people.

The war is closely identified with the prince in his role as defense minister. His image once adorned war propaganda but is rarely associated with the war now, although he has said it must continue in order to quash Iranian influence.

Even before the conflict, Yemen was the poorest country on the Arabian peninsula and now millions of people there are facing famine and a cholera epidemic. The coalition denies it blocks commercial shipments of food, medicine and fuel.

QATAR

Prince Mohammed has helped lead a diplomatic campaign to isolate Qatar, saying Riyadh’s erstwhile ally backs terrorism and cozies up to Iran. Qatar rejects the accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors’ backing for authoritarian rulers.

The campaign has divided Gulf Arab countries, who Washington regards as essential to its influence in the region. Qatar had incensed Riyadh by cheering Arab Spring uprisings against some autocratic Arab rulers.

CONFRONTATION WITH IRAN

Saudi Arabia’s rivalry with Iran, its competitor for influence in the Middle East, has deepened as King Salman and Prince Mohammed worked to build a Sunni coalition against Tehran and its allies in the Arab world.

In May, as deputy crown prince, Prince Mohammed used unusually provocative language to rule out dialogue with revolutionary Shi‘ite Muslim theocracy Iran, which he said was trying to interfere in Arab lands and dominate the Muslim world.

On Tuesday, state media quoted him as describing Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen as “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

Prince Mohammed has also opened a new front in the proxy war with Iran by threatening Tehran’s ally Hezbollah and its home country Lebanon. The resignation on Saturday of the Saudi-allied Lebanese prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, announced from Riyadh, was widely seen as the first act on this new front.

The crown prince has also sought the help of Shi‘ite leaders in Iraq to try to reverse Iran’s dominant role there and shore up security on the kingdom’s northern border, and has tried to improve ties with the United States under Trump, who shares his and King Salman’s antipathy to Iran’s government.

SAUDI ARAMCO

The planned sale of about 5 percent of national oil company Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] next year is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s blueprint to move the economy away from what he called its “addiction to oil” toward the private sector.

The IPO is expected to raise as much as $100 billion but investors wonder whether Aramco can be valued anywhere close to the $2 trillion figure announced by the crown prince and there has been market speculation that the IPO could be delayed beyond 2018 or shelved. He recently stated it would happen next year.

Many Saudis have misgivings about the sale, with some fearing Riyadh is selling cheaply at a time of low oil prices.

ECONOMIC REFORMS

Vision 2030 has begun to reduce a big state budget deficit with austerity measures but has not yet created major new sources of non-oil growth or jobs.

The phased removal of subsidies on fuel, water and electricity has started but some austerity moves have been unpopular. Already, some have been reversed or delayed as the economy has slowed because of low oil prices.

The plan includes private investment and privatizations and building the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The aim is to create jobs and raise the participation of women in the workforce from 22 percent now to 30 percent by 2030.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

Saudi Arabia adheres to an austere Wahhabi brand of Sunni Islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas.

Prince Mohammed’s ascent represents a social and cultural sea change, with power set to be passed to a much younger generation seemingly more in tune with young Saudis. In moves that reinforce that perception, women will be permitted to drive from next year and allowed to attend sports events.

The crown prince has also said the country will move to a more open and tolerant interpretation of Islam, and reforms have begun in areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy such as education, courts and the law. Saudi authorities have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date Islam.

NEOM

Last month Prince Mohammed announced a $500-billion plan to create a business and industrial zone extending across its borders into Jordan and Egypt, part of his efforts to reduce dependence on oil.

The 26,500 square-km (10,230 square-mile) zone, known as NEOM, will focus on industries including energy and water, biotechnology, food, advanced manufacturing and entertainment, and will power itself solely with wind power and solar energy.

Statements of support from EU ambassadors to Lebanon and the United States have set a different tone to their Sunni Gulf ally Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon together with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah as parties hostile to it.

Lebanon has been pitched into deep crisis since the Saudi-allied Saad al-Hariri resigned on Saturday in a speech delivered from Saudi Arabia in which he accused Hezbollah and Iran of sowing strife in the Arab world and cited fear of assassination.

The circumstances surrounding Hariri’s sudden resignation have given rise to wide speculation that he had been caught up in a high-level anti-corruption purge in Saudi Arabia, where his family made their fortune, and coerced into resigning.

Saudi Arabia has denied this along with reports that it has put Hariri under house arrest. It says he quit because Hezbollah was calling the shots in the government.

The move has pulled Lebanon back to the forefront of a regional struggle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Shi‘ite Islamist government of Iran, a rivalry which has also swept through Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen.

It has plunged Lebanon into political crisis and hit market confidence in the heavily indebted Lebanese state. A sell off of Lebanese bonds continued for a third day on Wednesday, with some of them hitting their lowest ever levels.

The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon said on Wednesday the United States remained “committed to a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous Lebanon” during a meeting with Lebanese army commander General Joseph Aoun, a U.S. embassy statement said.

The meeting was to announce a U.S. government reimbursement of $42.9 million for border operations conducted by the Lebanese army, a major recipient of U.S. military aid.

The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group even as it supports the weak Lebanese state, drawing a line between the two in a long-standing policy.

On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said Lebanon was a strong U.S. partner. “The United States strongly supports the legitimate institutions in the Lebanese state,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

“We expect all members of the international community to respect fully those institutions and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon,” she said.

In a statement, EU ambassadors to Lebanon said they reaffirmed “their strong support for the continued unity, stability, sovereignty, and security of Lebanon and its people”.

SYRIAN REFUGEES

Lebanon has also received significant Western aid to help it cope with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, equivalent to around a quarter of the population.

Hezbollah, set up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is the most powerful group in Lebanon, with major sway in government and a guerrilla army that outguns the national military.

The group’s role has grown beyond Lebanon in recent years, and its fighters have provided critical support to President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government have responded to accusations made by Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the kingdom.

President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally who took office last year, has refused to accept Hariri’s resignation, saying he first wants him to return to Lebanon so he can meet him in person to understand the reasons.

Aoun said Lebanon’s security and economy were stable and the presidency still viewed Hariri as prime minister, Lebanese media reported. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has said the coalition government led by Hariri still stands.

NEW PM NOT SEEN LIKELY IN SHORT TERM

Lebanese policymakers and bankers say there is no concern for the Lebanese pound - which has been pegged against the U.S. dollar at the same rate for two decades - thanks to record levels of foreign currency reserves.

Banking sources say there was more demand than usual for converting Lebanese pound savings into dollars when banks opened on Monday. But they said this was not unexpected and is at minimal levels.

Lebanon’s June 2020 bond, and its April 2020 issue both fell to their lowest ever levels on Wednesday.

“Yields could come down, if a new Prime Minister is found quickly and the government can get back to business, but this doesn’t appear to be likely in the short term,” said Carmen Altenkirch, emerging market sovereign analyst at Axa Investment Managers.

Byblos Bank’s Chief Economist Nassib Ghobril said: “We’ve had worse cases when we saw pressure on the actual peg of Lebanese pound to U.S. dollar but it takes a severe shock of the magnitude of the (former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri) assassination in 2005 or the 2006 Israeli war to put real pressure on the currency peg.”","EU, U.S. affirm Lebanon support, diverging from Saudi",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-crisis/eu-u-s-affirm-lebanon-support-diverging-from-saudi-idUSKBN1D811H

As Prime Minister Theresa May heads towards a 2019 EU divorce that will shape Britain’s prosperity for generations, her minority government has stumbled into several controversies that risk shattering her dwindling authority.

Development Secretary Patel apologised to May on Monday for failing to report she had met senior Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a private holiday.

She had failed to follow the usual procedures that ministers inform Britain’s Foreign Office before conducting official business overseas and said she regretted suggesting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had been aware of her trip.

On Wednesday, the Sun said Patel had also met Israel’s Foreign Ministry’ Director General Yuval Rotem in New York and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan in London but had not informed May about either meeting despite giving her assurances there had been no other undisclosed talks.

A government source confirmed the meetings took place. The source said that no UK government officials were present for these discussions, and they were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures.

May’s Downing Street office could not be reached for a comment and there was no comment from Britain’s Department for International Development. Patel could not be reached for comment.

Investors have snapped up shares in Razer, a maker of keyboards and mice for gamers, and China Literature, the electronic publishing arm of locally listed heavyweight Tencent. That contrasts with signs of fatigue over initial public offerings in New York and London. Limited supply, particularly in tech, has helped keep the market healthy.

On Tuesday, Razer priced its $545 million IPO close to the top of the range, IFR reported, after drawing strong demand. Shares of China Literature, which raised $1.1 billion last week, are set to debut on Wednesday. Retail investors placed orders worth a staggering 620 times the number of shares on offer, according to someone familiar with the deal.

This is despite flagging sentiment elsewhere. Last week, shares in the doll-maker Funko cratered some 40 percent in New York - the worst first-day showing in 17 years. And two British outfits shelved planned London listings, following other disappointing debuts.

A shortage of deals helps. As of Nov. 2, world IPO volumes are up 29 percent this year at $143 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows, while volumes in the United States have rocketed 103 percent. But new listings in Hong Kong have totalled just $8.4 billion this year. That is less than half of last year’s amount, which was boosted by the $7.6 billion listing of Postal Savings Bank of China. And with a global technology rally in full swing, investors are hungry for stocks that tap into exciting trends, like a global gaming market or China’s smartphone-wielding consumers.

A wave of companies like Razer and China Literature will help make the local market more dynamic.

L‘istituto nel trimestre ha continuato a restringere il focus del suo business e ha tentato di attirare gli investitori con altre acquisizioni in Italia -- uno dei suoi mercati chiave insieme alla Francia -- vendendo nel contempo la maggior parte delle partecipazioni negli asset non strategici in Egitto.

L‘utile netto della banca si è attestato a 1,07 miliardi di euro, rispetto ad attese degli analisti per 1,03 miliardi, mentre i ricavi -- 4,58 miliardi -- sono stati inferiori alle aspettative di un sondaggio Reuters di 4,76 miliardi.

Il trading sui mercati finanziari rappresenta una nota dolente, come anche nel caso di molti istituti rivali, con i ricavi provenienti dai mercati dei capitali in flessione del 28% rispetto a un anno fa, quando erano stati sostenuti da una maggiore attività legata alla Brexit.

I ricavi sottostanti della banca francese LCL sono scesi del 3,4%, appesantiti da un calo delle commissioni per la rinegoziazione dei mutui e dall‘impatto di precedenti rinegoziazioni sul margine di interesse.

La banca, che detiene una quota di maggioranza nella società di gestione Amundi, ha realizzato una serie di acquisizioni nei settori dell‘asset e wealth management, nel tentativo di incrementare i rendimenti dopo anni di stretta al bilancio per adattarsi alle severe regole europee sul patrimonio.

Nell‘ambito degli sforzi per concentrarsi sui mercati chiave di Francia e Italia, recentemente Credit Agricole ha annunciato l‘acquisizione di tre piccole banche in Italia e una partecipazione di maggioranza in Banca Leonardo.

La banca ha detto oggi che le acquisizioni, ancora non finalizzate, avranno un impatto negativo di 15 punti base sul Cet1.

Tuttavia l‘istituto ha smentito qualsiasi piano di grande fusione nel breve termine.

“Non abbiamo piani di rilevare il capitale o una porzione di capitale di Commerzbank. La priorità è la crescita organica”, ha dichiarato il Ceo Philippe Brassac.

Il mese scorso Handelsblatt ha pubblicato un‘intervista a Brassac in cui il Ceo diceva che Agricole avrebbe espresso interesse in Commerzbank se fosse stata in vendita.

Il titolo ha aperto in calo alla borsa di Parigi e nelle prime battute cede il 3,5% circa.

The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.

However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures LCOc1 have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness.

The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.

For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.

Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production.

According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower.

In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.

Infographic ID: '2rolpok'

Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels.

“A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,” said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.

UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.

The increases were driven by Hess Corp (HES.N) and Apache Corp (APA.N), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.

Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels.

“I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,” said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.

SOME NEW PLAYERS

In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels.

Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (EOG.N) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges.

Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.

“Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,” said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

Clear agreement on proceeding without the United States would be a boost for the principle of multilateral free trade pacts over the bilateral deal-making that Trump argues will give a better result for American workers.

Japan has been lobbying hard ahead of this week’s meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to get full signoff on an agreement that is also a counterweight to China’s growing regional dominance.

But Canada, whose economy is the second biggest among the TPP-11 after Japan, has joined other countries seeking changes or with misgivings about moving too fast.

“Canada will not be rushed into a deal that is not in the best interest of Canada and of Canadians,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference in Vietnam’s capital Hanoi.

The TPP aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across a bloc whose trade totaled $356 billion last year. It also has provisions for protecting everything from labor rights to the environment to intellectual property - one of the main sticking points.

The original 12 countries had reached agreement on the TPP in 2016, but Trump withdrew in one of his first acts in office - throwing its very survival into doubt.

FRIDAY MEETING

Trump and other APEC leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China and Russian President Vladimir Putin, will meet on Friday in the Vietnamese seaside resort of Danang.

Leaders of the TPP-11, all of which are also APEC members, will break away to consider proposals for proceeding with the trade deal that have been drawn up by their trade negotiators and ministers.

Japan had said it hoped a broad agreement could be reached among the 11 countries in Danang.

“This is not about Friday, it’s about the next decades,” Canada’s trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, told Reuters. “We are constructive, we are even creative at the table. At the same time we want to make sure we get the right deal.”

The positions of both Canada and Mexico are also complicated by the fact that they are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the Trump administration.

Also in doubt is the appetite of New Zealand’s new government to move ahead swiftly. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was too early to say a deal could be reached this week.

“We see a real responsibility to come in and make sure that the agreement is in the best interest of New Zealand,” she said.

Both Malaysia and Vietnam would have been big beneficiaries of the original agreement as a result of the removal of U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, with an election approaching and growing ties to Beijing, has less incentive to move ahead fast.

Among options being discussed by TPP countries is whether to suspend some provisions of the original agreement to avoid having to renegotiate it and potentially to entice the United States back in the long term, officials said.",Canada says won't be rushed on TPP trade deal at Asia-Pacific meeting,https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D80BH-OCATP

The startup, which makes robots for the elderly, was the first Israeli investment for Toyota AI Ventures, a new $100 million fund investing in artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous mobility and data and cloud computing.

“We will see more involvement of Toyota in the Israeli market in the future,” said Jim Adler, managing director of California-based Toyota AI Ventures, which is part of the $1 billion Toyota Research Institute.

“There’s more in the pipeline,” he told Reuters during a visit to Israel, adding that technologies dealing with perception and prediction and planning were of particular interest to Toyota.

Perception technology enables a self-driving vehicle to understand the world around it while prediction and planning can help a car interpret situations such as whether a child at an intersection might try to cross at a red light.

“There’s a tremendous amount of innovation happening in Israel as cars become more produced by data,” said Adler, who is in the country meeting companies whose technologies interest Toyota.

Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Earlier this year Intel Corp bought autonomous vehicle firm Mobileye - one of Israel’s biggest tech companies - for $15.3 billion.

On Friday Germany’s Continental AG said it was buying Israel’s Argus Cyber Security, whose technology guards connected cars against hacking.

Toyota AI Ventures has made five investments and expects to invest in at least 20 companies worldwide.

Regarding its investment in Intuition Robotics - which plans to begin trials of its robots with older adults in their homes early next year - Adler said there were many common features between robotics and autonomous vehicles, which he referred to as “big robots with wheels”.

Japan’s population is aging, with 40 percent expected to be over 65 in 20 years, he said, and there will be demand for technologies that help the elderly stay in their homes, rather than have to move to assisted-living facilities.

“We think Toyota will have a role there,” he said.","Toyota seeks more investments in Israeli auto tech, robotics",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-tech-toyota/toyota-seeks-more-investments-in-israeli-auto-tech-robotics-idUSKBN1D50OI

While North Korea and trade are set to dominate the formal part of the visit, which ends on Friday, China has been keen to show the importance it puts on Trump’s visit, the first by a foreign leader since the end of a key Communist Party congress last month where Xi cemented his power.

Trump and his wife Melania were whisked from Beijing airport - where they were met by China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a key player in the outreach to Trump since he won election a year ago - straight to the Forbidden City.

Chatting over cups of tea, Trump showed Xi a video of his granddaughter Arabella Kushner singing in Mandarin and reciting classical Chinese poetry, prompting Xi to compliment her performance as worthy of an “A+”, Chinese state media said.

Xi said he hoped Arabella would visit China soon, noting that she was already a “child star” in China, the official Xinhua news agency said.

A video of Arabella reciting a Chinese poem went viral on Chinese social media shortly after Trump’s election last year.

In another break from precedent, Xi himself gave the Trumps a tour of the imperial treasures of the Forbidden City, a UNESCO World Heritage site cleared of tourists for the day, before the two first couples watched Chinese opera and an acrobatic display.

“That’s something!” Trump said after the show, as he and Xi walked away. “We’re having a great time.”

China had widely been expected to pull out all the stops for Trump, who has pressed it to do more to control its neighbor North Korea, and resolve a yawning trade gap with the United States.

The ceremony on Trump’s arrival at Beijing’s airport on Wednesday was also more elaborate than usual, with the Trumps met by a marching band and soldiers standing at attention. Smartly dressed children waving miniature Chinese and American flags jumped up and down as Trump’s motorcade passed.

In another rare, if not unprecedented step, Trump’s official ceremonial welcome at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday will be broadcast live on national television, state broadcaster CCTV said.

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

The spokesman for the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), Bulent Tezcan, said that such offshore companies deprived Turkey of much-needed tax revenue.

“This is not a crime from a legal standpoint, that is a different argument, but it is wrong morally. Does your country need money? Yes, it does,” he said. “The first and only thing that the prime minister needs to do, now that this has surfaced, is to resign.”

The CHP and the pro-Kurdish HDP together submitted a motion to the parliament to investigate those named in the Paradise Papers, although it is unlikely to gain much traction in a legislature dominated by Yildirim’s ruling AKP.

Yildirim has said his sons, who are involved in the shipping industry, were not guilty of any wrongdoing.

“Shipping is a global business. They do business all over the globe, so they have companies and contacts all over the world,” he told reporters before departing for the United States on an official visit on Tuesday.

He invited critics to open a financial or legal investigation, and said it was “unacceptable” to accuse innocent people of wrongdoing.

He also showed reporters a certificate given to his family-owned company, showing it as one of the firms that paid the most in tax in Istanbul.

The Paradise Papers, which were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets, relate to the investments of individuals from U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth.

The wax figure of May, stepping out of Number 10 Downing Street in a red power suit and leopardskin kitten-heeled shoes, was unveiled by Madame Tussauds, a waxworks museum that is one of London’s top tourist attractions.

The real May, meanwhile, was battling multiple crises at once, with several of her cabinet ministers embroiled in scandals, open strife in her party over how to deliver Brexit and persistent debate about her suitability for the job.

“Whilst her policies may be questioned we can guarantee our wax figure of the prime minister is most definitely strong and stable,” said Edward Fuller, general manager of Madame Tussauds, poking fun at an election campaign slogan that backfired on May.

Presenting herself as pillar of “strong and stable leadership”, May called a snap election in June expecting to win by a hefty margin, but her campaign failed to inspire the voters and she instead lost her parliamentary majority.

Since then, her divided government has lurched from one crisis to another, with May’s humiliation culminating in a speech at her party conference during which a prankster joined her on stage and letters fell off a slogan behind her.

There was none of that sense of chaos and drift in the scene presented by Madame Tussauds, which shows a smiling May holding a smart black folder and stepping forward from the famous black door of her Downing Street office.

The red suit worn by the wax figure is the same as the one donned by May for a visit to the White House during which she held hands with U.S. President Donald Trump -- one of the most widely published images of her term as prime minister.

The real May also wore the red suit on election night in June, an unhappy occasion that saw her appear on stage to acknowledge victory in her local electoral district even as the scale of the debacle on the national scale was becoming clear.

That makes Tuesday’s defeat at ADP especially embarrassing for Bill Ackman. Fewer than one shareholder in four backed the Pershing Square boss’s bid for three seats on the payroll processor’s board.

The result capped a bitter three-month battle between the hedge-fund boss and his Roseland, New Jersey-based target. Ackman argued that ADP was losing ground to upstart rivals and needed to respond by changing management incentives and putting more emphasis on software development. He secured the backing of the major proxy advisers: Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones called on holders to vote for his three nominees, while Institutional Shareholder Services supported a single seat for Ackman.

But ADP wasn’t an obvious target. Its stock had more than doubled over the preceding five years, handily outperforming the S&P 500 – and Pershing Square’s own Amsterdam-listed shares. The company has been working on its digital strategy at a pace that doesn’t scare off existing customers.

Chief Executive Carlos Rodriguez didn’t shrink from the fight, either. He vigorously defended the company’s performance and strategy and lambasted Ackman as a “spoiled brat.” Rodriguez was anything but magnanimous in victory on Tuesday, declaring the result “an ass-whipping” for his nemesis.

Shareholders seem ready to give Rodriguez time to execute ADP’s technological shift. Although the stock has given up half the 12 percent bump it got when news of Pershing Square’s stake first broke back in July, it was trading nearly 1 percent higher after the meeting.

Ackman is unlikely to get such a respite. His listed vehicle was down 3.3 percent net of fees in the first 10 months of this year, while Hedge Fund Research’s Activist Index gained 5.7 percent in the first three quarters. He’s now on a three-year losing streak. Failed bets on drugmaker Valeant and against Herbalife, a nutritional-supplement maker Ackman alleged was a Ponzi scheme, contributed to the fund’s negative returns of 13.5 percent last year and 20.5 percent in 2015. Chipotle Mexican Grill, another key holding, is down 42 percent so far this year.

The declaration of independence made by Catalonia’s parliament a week ago was constitutionally illegal. Shots of huge pro-independence rallies obscure the fact that, in an opinion poll in the summer, 49.4 per cent opposed breaking away from Spain while 41.1 per cent supported it. Unionists have held their own large rallies and a new poll in El Mundo shows their parties with a slight polling lead in the December Catalan elections.

The parliamentary vote for independence – taken in a half-full chamber after the anti-independence parties left in protest – was swiftly followed by Rajoy, fully backed by his parliament and senate, ordering the parliament’s dissolution and the sacking of Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels. Nine of his colleagues in the Catalan leadership were accused in Spain’s high court on Thursday of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, eight of whom were detained in custody. Puigdemont has said he will return, but only if given guarantees of a fair trial.

Strong support in the rest of Spain for a hard line against Catalonian independence masks a longer-term problem for Rajoy and his country. The prime minister heads a minority government, unable to find a stable coalition partner. In July, Rajoy became the first serving prime minister to testify in court, denying allegations that he was complicit in a wide-ranging corruption scandal in his center-right Peoples’ Party, investigations of which have dragged on over the past two decades. Rajoy himself has not been charged.

Thus a national leader with a weakened base faces Puigdemont, a regional leader who has weakened his own base by flight. Puigdemont may not be the man to lead Catalonia to independence, and it may not presently be in the cards. But it will remain a strong current in Catalan politics and is indicative of the larger problems within the EU that threaten the integrity of the Union at least as much as Brexit.

In country after European country, the trend away from the center continues and presently grows. As the Washington Post’s Ishaan Tharoor observes, most nationalisms are not only championed by aggressively right-wing leaderships and parties mobilizing a largely working or lower middle-class electorate fed up with being left behind. “Another trend to watch ought to be the impatient regionalism of more metropolitan parts of Europe, frustrated by the backward politics of their nation-states,” writes Tharoor.

The rich defectors are led by Catalonia, Spain’s most productive region and the one with the strongest independence movement. Catalan separatists argued that paying less in taxes to the Spanish government would be an economic boon to the province. But others now show signs of wishing to join, or at least look at the entrance fees, of the wealthy breakaway club. Most surprising – since it is part of the relatively successful German economy – is the southern state of Bavaria: in July, a poll for the popular tabloid Bild showed one in three favors independence.

Last month, the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the two richest of Italy’s 20 regions, accounting between them for some 30 per cent of the nation’s GDP, voted overwhelmingly for more autonomy. The Liga party, strong in the area, had a policy of independence. That’s now moderated, but there’s growing dissatisfaction that the region’s taxes are poured into the much poorer, much less productive south. The division amounts to two separate economies, a problem which feeds northern separatism.

Even in Belgium, the administrative heart of the EU, the tensions are showing. The divided reaction to Puigdemont in Brussels – with a Flemish nationalist cabinet minister welcoming him, while the prime minister, from the French-speaking Walloon area showed a cold face – was a glimpse into the fractured politics of the Belgian state. The center has given away much of its power to the two main regions in an effort to avoid a complete split – and will be pressed by the richer Flemish region to do still more after national elections in 2019, to the point where the central state will cease to exist.

Scotland, whose devolved parliament is dominated by the Scottish nationalists, has seen a dimming of enthusiasm for independence as its offshore oil reserves and the income from them have ceased to promise a wealthy future, as even its own economic commission has admitted. A botched Brexit, however, could revive the movement among a population which voted decisively for remaining in the EU. France, where the economy is reviving, still has independence movements in the island of Corsica (where nationalists now control the regional assembly) and the western region of Brittany, where support is still a minority pursuit, but growing. (Brittany and Corsica have roughly average per capita GDPs for France; their independence movements are more cultural than economic – though all nationalist movements invoke some cultural difference, often rooted in centuries’ old histories.)

The EU cannot look on these movements with anything but disfavor and alarm. Though the rich breakaways would – as Catalonia does – wish to remain in the EU, a general exodus would face the union with its largest crisis yet. Were a region to succeed in forming a viable independent state, it would be required to apply for membership. Its application would not be considered until all legal and territorial issues had been settled with the country of which it had been a part – a process which might consume a decade until the application was successful.

The widespread distrust of mainstream politicians and central governments, and the conviction that local populists would do a better job, now takes a concrete and threatening form. Nationalism, which the EU had wished to see fade, even die, now instead revives, sometimes – as in Central Europe – in illiberal, even authoritarian, forms.

The EU is less and less seen as an ideal, a borderless federation-in-the-making. Its processes – remote, intricate and little understood – lose out when contrasted with the warmth and intimacy of a new-old country which can draw on its history and culture, keep out unwanted immigrants and restore pride and trust. Such is the promise of many of the new nationalisms: the EU can disapprove, but in its still-fragile state can do little except to hope that the nationalist tide will retreat. For the moment, it’s still rising.",Commentary: How the Catalonia vote threatens the EU,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-catalonia-commentary/commentary-how-the-catalonia-vote-threatens-the-eu-idUSKBN1D31U1

The details of the stake, revealed by Snapchat after badly received quarterly results, came as U.S. and Chinese firms announced $9 billion in new deals on the arrival of President Donald Trump in Beijing.

It helped the U.S. company recoup a slide of almost 20 percent in pre-trading in New York after it reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations.

Snap shares recovered to trade down 12 percent at $13.29 in premarket trading from a close of $15.12 on Tuesday.

Snap’s largely privately owned structure, which reserves 95 percent of voting rights for its co-founders, made it likely Tencent was just accumulating a financial stake.

“While such news may be initially perceived as positive by the market, one has to remember that Tencent’s holdings in Snap is the non-voting Class A shares, which makes a possible acquisition of Snap by Tencent less likely,” said Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.

Along with Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent has poured billions of cash from a decade of growth in China into buying U.S. firms and holds 5 percent of electric car maker Tesla, as well as stakes in ride service company Lyft and augmented reality startup Magic Leap.

The largest social media and gaming company in China and owner of the popular mobile application WeChat, it had previously invested in Snap through an affiliate in 2013, and has been referred as a “role model” by Snap’s co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel.

Snap said in its quarterly report that Tencent had bought 145.8 million shares of its non-voting Class A common stock on the open market. Snap had about 1.2 billion shares outstanding, as of Oct 31.(bit.ly/2zqvybE)

“The positive side of this could be that the two companies may create business partnership of some kind or Tencent may aid Snap in expanding its reach into China,” Morningstar’s Mogharabi said.

Unlike many U.S. stock market-listed corporations, Snap is not obligated to disclose changes in Tencent’s ownership of Snap’s Class A stock. Snap said it had only received the details of the stake from Tencent this month and declined to answer further questions on the filing.

Snap, on Tuesday, reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations, as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s Instagram. The company has disappointed investors each quarter since it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March.

Snap’s daily active users (DAU) stood at 178 million, below expectation of 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

On October 5, the militant group lost the northern town of Hawija – its last urban stronghold after Iraqi forces recaptured Mosul and Tal Afar earlier this year. The brutal battles for these cities have been well documented. Less noticed, however, has been how the near-total defeat of IS is reshaping political and sectarian alliances in the region.

The rise and fall of IS has had a sobering and unifying effect on relationships between Sunnis and Shi’ites. In Iraq, where thousands died in the vicious sectarian war that followed the fall of Saddam Hussein, residents of the mainly-Sunni cities of Mosul and Hawija nonetheless jubilantly welcomed the mostly-Shi’ite Iraqi forces who freed the cities from the Sunni extremists of IS. “They helped liberate us,” one Hawija Sunni leader told the New York Times of the fighters. Nor does a Shi’ite backlash against Sunnis seem imminent given Shi’ite recognition of Sunni suffering in the IS-occupied cities.

The IS experience has affected Iranian politics too. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to show a softer attitude toward Sunnis in a rare pronouncement – seen as carrying the weight of a fatwa – publicly prohibiting any discrimination against minorities. Sunnis have fewer rights than Shi’ites in Iran, and Khamenei’s August comment was made in response to an inquiry by Molavi Abdul Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric from Iran's impoverished Sunni-dominated Sistan-Baluchistan province on the Pakistan border. In Syria too, IS's faster-than-expected battlefield defeats suggest that the group does not enjoy much local support among the Sunni tribes and populations it has been ruling for the past couple of years.

The biggest changes can be seen in Iraq, where Shi’ite leaders’ attempts to develop a post-IS foreign policy are driven in part by fear of Iran’s growing influence and in part by the IS-inflicted suffering in Iraq. Many observers believe that the pursuit of sectarian policies at the expense of Iraqi Sunnis – as systematically practiced under the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki – expedited the rise of IS.

The result of the new dynamic is that Iraq’s main Shi’ite leaders are distancing themselves from Iran as they make once-unthinkable overtures to the region’s Sunni Arab bloc. In one of the latest signs of that shift, Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Al-Abadi declined Tehran’s official invitation to take part in President Hassan Rouhani’s second-term inauguration ceremony on August 5. Such a refusal would have been unimaginable a few years ago.

Similarly, prominent Shi’ite leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada al-Sadr snubbed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the newly-appointed chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council – a governing body set up to mediate disputes between Parliament and the Council of Guardians over whether planned legislation conforms with Islamic law – during an official visit to Iraq as the envoy of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.

Sadr said after the meeting that he hoped it was 'the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region.' Bandar Algaloud/Courtesy of Saudi Royal Court/Handout via REUTERS

Underscoring the point, Baghdad publicly slammed a deal made by Hezbollah, Iran’s chief proxy in the region, to evacuate a group of IS fighters from Lebanon to eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. The Tehran-backed agreement was “unacceptable” and “an insult to the Iraqi people,” Prime Minister Abadi said in August.

Iranian influence on Iraq’s domestic politics is shrinking too. Ammar al-Hakim resigned as head of the Tehran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq – the country’s largest Shi’ite party – a month after a June meeting with Khalid al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and an informal advisor to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Hakim promptly went on to form the National Wisdom Movement, a political party to “embrace” all Iraqis. (After publication of this column, a spokesman for Hakim's movement told Reuters that while Hakim and Faisal had both attended an iftar, the evening meal that breaks the fast during Ramadan, Faisal ""was one of the invitees among other many people, and there was no meeting or political talk during that event."")

At the same time, Iran-funded, Shi’ite-dominated militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces are divided over whether they should be integrated into the regular Iraqi army – a measure that would loosen Iran’s foothold in Iraq’s security apparatus – or whether they should remain independent of the Iraqi government. Groups loyal to Sadr and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have started taking steps to register with the army; those led by Hadi al-Amiri of the Badr Organization and Qais al-Khazali of Asaib Ahl al-Haq remain in the pro-Iran camp.

Against this backdrop, Iraq is trying to improve its ties with Saudi Arabia. In addition to several recent diplomatic visits between the two countries, including one by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Riyadh, Moqtada al-Sadr – an influential Shi’ite cleric with a large following among Iraq’s urban poor – made rare and well-received visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. After meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, Sadr issued a statement saying that he was “very pleased with what we found to be a positive breakthrough in the Saudi-Iraqi relations,” and that he hoped it was “the beginning of the retreat of sectarian strife in the Arab-Islamic region."" Sadr’s Aug. 13 meeting with Emirati crown prince Zayed al-Nahayan appeared equally successful. “Experience has taught us to always call for what brings Arabs and Muslims together, and to reject the advocates of division,” Nahyan told Sadr, in a veiled reference to Iran as one of the dividers.

It is clearly in Iraq’s strategic interests to diversify its relationships beyond reflexive sectarian or ideological lines. Improved ties with Riyadh pave the way for Baghdad to receive much-needed financial aid from Saudi Arabia and establish an economic relationship that could help counter the political and military influence established when Iran cultivated Shi’ite proxies to fight U.S.-backed forces in Iraq. The outreach can also signal to Iraq’s Sunni minority that the Baghdad government is not an Iranian stooge.

Iraq’s post-IS foreign policy could have broader regional benefits too. For Riyadh, closer ties with Baghdad can help the Saudi leadership feel less threatened by Iran’s rising influence and the perception that Riyadh’s share of regional power has diminished as a result. That in turn may lead to a thaw in Iranian-Saudi ties and a broader contribution to regional security.

Nonetheless, the fact is that neither Riyadh nor Tehran can achieve sustainable hegemony in the region at the expense of the other.

Vehicles of every sort already are starting to add wireless chips to download everything from maps to entertainment, and in a few years nearly every new car may be connected. Self-driving cars, still in test mode, will accelerate the move.

“The amount of chips per car is going to grow dramatically,” said Egil Juliussen, a principal analyst for automotive technology at IHSMarkit.

Chip makers are scrambling to create new mobile networks, the so-called fifth generation, which will link phones as well as cars, drones and even industrial devices such as smart street lights, which count pedestrians and send data to city planners.

Qualcomm long was the dominant communications chip maker for mobile phones, although computer chip maker Intel has begun muscling into the space. Each now supplies about half Apple Inc’s iPhone communications chips, for instance.

Now they are jockeying in a mature market to design so-called 5G networks that will be up to 10 times as fast as wireless networks today, which are expected to start rolling out in 2020. Research firm IDC predicts 1.53 billion smart phones will be shipped in 2017 expanding to only 1.77 billion units in 2021.

The market for modem chips for cars, by contrast, is expected to grow sharply. Tristan Gerra, a senior semiconductor analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co, said that this year, only about 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured per year have internet connectivity. But connectivity will become ubiquitous on self-driving cars.

“You basically (will) have 80 million units per year that are going to get a modem,” he said.

Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment.

Qualcomm itself is trying to buy NXP Semiconductors, a maker of automotive chips from so-called “infotainment” system chips to camera systems, for $38 billion. It is unclear whether that deal will go through and whether Broadcom would take on NXP, but Broadcom has said it is willing to do so.

A tie-up between the three companies could create a formidable competitor in the automotive chip space, said IHSMarkit’s Juliussen. He views Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place.

Intel has bought itself into relationships with autonomous car developers thanks to its acquisition of vision system maker Mobileye. Broadcom would get something similar with NXP, Juliussen said.

If Broadcom pulls off both deals, its market position in some areas could be dominant, said Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman.

The British-based team said in a preview for Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix that, with nothing at stake, they could afford to become “a little bolder” and experiment in Friday practice.

The experiments could also be carried over into the race for newly-crowned four times world champion Lewis Hamilton and team mate Valtteri Bottas.

“These two final weekends are not only an opportunity to test new parts, but also allow experiments for those tasks that the team simply doesn’t have the opportunity to complete during a normal race weekend,” said Mercedes.

“The team will have an intense program on the next two Fridays in Brazil and Abu Dhabi to make the absolute most of the opportunities that have been afforded by early title success.”

Mercedes won the constructors’ championship for the fourth year in a row in Texas last month while Hamilton, now Britain’s most successful driver of all time, took his fourth title in Mexico.

Mercedes said they would be using prominent aerodynamic devices, of the type usually seen in pre-season testing and which carry extra weight, in Friday practice.

They will also test some new pit-stop equipment and techniques in live conditions for the first time.

Team boss Toto Wolff said there would be no easing up when it came to racing, however.

Revolut, which has offered a pre-paid cash card since 2015, is one of a number of smaller upstart finance firms hoping that coming regulation and technology can help it break the dominance of bigger banks.

Financial technology firms like Revolut are trying to chip away at traditional banks by offering users slick apps, slashed fees and an instant overview of their finances. From challenger banks to digital currencies like Bitcoin, the British government regards the ‘fintech’ sector as a key source of growth.

Changes coming into force in Britain and across the European Union will see banks forced to open up their closely held customer data to rivals, who will be able to use it to build products and better target clients.

Peers like Britain’s Starling Bank and Monzo and Germany’s N26 have already secured banking licenses ahead of the new rules.

“Even without a banking license, we have attracted over 950,000 users across Europe, many of whom consider Revolut as their primary current account and spending card,” said Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut’s founder and CEO.

The firm’s tagline promises an experience “beyond banking”, but so far it has been unable to offer some of the core services provided by banks, including current accounts, overdrafts, loans and direct debits.

It expects to receive a license effective in the first half of 2018 and to start offering these services in select markets straightaway.

It said it has applied for its license through the Lithuanian central bank and has sufficient capital in place.

Current accounts and credit will initially be available to users in Lithuania, before being rolled out to Estonia and Latvia and, as soon as possible, Britain. Next in line are France, Germany and Italy and eventually the rest of the European Union, the firm said.

Fintech lender Cashplus said last week it was considering applying for a UK banking license, while telecoms giant Orange has launched its own bank in France in a bid to steal established lenders’ market share by capitalizing on the rise of smartphones.

But incumbent banks are stepping up investment in their own digital platforms too.

Each day, the teams drove several hours to Raqqa from their base. Once at the front line, threats included mortars, shelling, airstrikes, snipers, land mines, suicide bomb attacks and kidnapping.

What is key to operating in unpredictable hostile environments like Raqqa? A mental shift that begins well before the journalist gets to the location.

“You need to ask yourself: ‘Can I go there and cover the story and come back safely, when there are no guarantees when it comes to safety? Can I take the risk?’ This is the question and only you can answer it,” cameraman Hamuda Hassan said.

For others, like Reuters photographer Erik De Castro, preparation begins in a more domestic fashion, from ensuring that his family in the Philippines has enough groceries to keep them supplied during his absence to more introspective rituals.

“I’m not a very religious man, but I’m a Catholic,” said De Castro. “Before I go on a dangerous assignment, I make sure to visit a church in Pangasinan in the northern Philippines - about a 12-hour trip - to pray for my safety.”

Reuters journalists covering conflicts like Raqqa regularly attend hostile environment training courses and frequently travel with a security adviser when entering combat zones. They study the geography of the locations they plan to visit and speak with colleagues who have already been in the area.

The teams traveled either in an armored car or on the open back of a pickup truck with the SDF fighters they were shadowing, before dashing from house to house with fighters.

For personal safety, they wore body armor and helmets and carried gas masks, and first aid kits. For work, they brought a veritable arsenal of cameras, tripods, lenses, spare batteries, satellite phones and laptop computers.

Collectively, the Raqqa reporting crew shares extensive experience covering conflicts around the globe, but that does not immunize anyone from danger.

Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, overcame a barrage of attack ads by Republican Ed Gillespie that hit the soft-spoken Democrat on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues.

Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but did not campaign with him, had taken a break from his Asia trip to send tweets and record messages on Tuesday supporting the former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

But after the outcome, Trump quickly distanced himself from Gillespie.

“Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Trump tweeted. “With the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!”

At his victory party, Northam told supporters the sweeping Democratic win in Virginia sent a message to the country.

“Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,” Northam said.

The Virginia race highlighted a slate of state and local elections that also included a governor’s race in New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and ambassador to Germany, defeated Republican Kim Guadagno for the right to succeed Republican Chris Christie.

Murphy had promised to be a check on Trump in Democratic-leaning New Jersey. Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, was hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie.

BOOST FOR DEMOCRATS

Murphy’s win and the Northam victory in Virginia, a state Democrat Hillary Clinton won by 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, provided a much-needed boost for national Democrats who were desperate to turn grassroots resistance to Trump into election victories.

But a strong turnout in the Democratic-leaning northern Virginia suburbs of Washington helped propel Northam, who in the end won relatively easily. With nearly all precincts reporting, he led by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin.

Exit polls in Virginia showed that one-third of the voters went to the polls to oppose Trump, and only 17 percent went to support him.

Democrats also swept the other top statewide Virginia races, winning the offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general, and gained seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrat Danica Roem beat a long-time Republican incumbent to become the first transgender person to win a state legislative race.

“This is a comprehensive political victory from statehouse to courthouse. Thank you Donald Trump!” Democratic U.S. Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told Northam’s supporters at a victory party in northern Virginia.

In Virginia, Democrats had worried that if Gillespie won, Republicans would see it as a green light to emphasize divisive cultural issues in their campaigns for next year’s elections, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the U.S. Senate’s 100 seats come up for election. Republicans now control both chambers.

Gillespie, speaking to crestfallen supporters in Richmond, Virginia, said he had run a “very policy-focused campaign.”

But voters in Arlington County - a suburban Democratic stronghold bordering Washington - said national politics were important to their votes.

“Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” said Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s presidential nomination.

Peacemaker said Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies after securing the Republican gubernatorial nomination.

In local races across the country, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston both easily won re-election. Voters were also picking mayors in Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle and Charlotte, North Carolina.",Democrats win bitter Virginia governor's race in setback for Trump,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/democrats-win-bitter-virginia-governors-race-in-setback-for-trump-idUSKBN1D71D7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews

Pesa anche la debolezza in borsa di Credit Agricole, che ha registrato utili trimestrali in calo, anche se robusti risultati altrove contribuiscono ad avere un quadro più roseo a livello di società.

Alle 11.35 ora italiana l‘indice STOXX 600 è in calo di quasi lo 0,2%, in linea con l‘indice della zona euro e quello delle blue-chip, appesantiti da banche, titoli finanziari e assicurativi.

LONDRA è piatta, FRANCOFORTE anche, PARIGI perde lo 0,2%, MADRID lo 0,74%.

Quello bancario è il comparto peggiore e perde lo 0,6% sulla scia delle perdite dei finanziari ieri a Wall Street, indeboliti dallo scetticismo sul piano dei repubblicani per la riduzione delle tasse di cui si parla da tempo.

“Una parte del calo si deve probabilmente al piano di riforma fiscale, ma abbiamo visto anche il rendimento dei titoli di Stato perdere di nuovo terreno, andando in direzione sbagliata per la banche”, dice Paul Harper, equity strategist di Dnb, aggiungendo che la popolarità dei titoli bancari europei quest‘anno potrebbe renderli vulnerabili a peggioramenti di sentiment sul mercato.

** Credit Agricole, che ha chiuso il terzo trimestre con utili in calo in un contesto di difficoltà per le attività di trading e di banca retail in Francia, perde il 4,6%.

Gli analisti si sono girati in negativo sui profitti delle banche della zona euro, dopo aver invece rivisto al rialzo le attese per l‘anno passato grazie a un miglioramento del sentiment per l‘economia, secondo i dati Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Robusti risultati societari in altri settori aiutano comunque a controbilanciare le perdite degli indici.

** La catena di supermercati olandesi Ahold Delhaize sale di quasi il 6% dopo che i profitti hanno superato le previsioni e l‘azienda ha annunciato un ampio buyback.

** L‘azienda francese di scommesse Ubisoft ha toccato un nuovo record dopo aver battuto le previsioni sulle vendite nel secondo trimestre. Guadagna l‘8,5%.

** Cala pesantemente dopo i risultati deludenti la società austriaca di materiali edilizi Wienerberger (-6,3%), mentre il produttore tedesco di cemento Heidelbergcement guadagna oltre il 4%, all‘interno di un comparto positivo.

** Guadagnano dopo i buoni risultati anche le tedesche Symrise, Brenntag e Schaeffler.

La catena commerciale Steinhoff perde quasi il 4%dopo che Reuters ha scritto che l‘azienda non ha comunicato agli investitori deal per circa 1 miliardo di dollari.

Con due terzi delle società che hanno già comunicato i risultati, gli analisti di Bernstein dicono che i risultati sono complessivamente solidi e che il clima del mercato è più dimesso di quanto servirebbe ai titoli.

Secondo MSCI Europe, i profitti del terzo trimestre segnano una crescita del 5,6% in termini di euro, secondo gli ultimi dati Thomson Reuters. L‘aumento è invece del 7,1% secondo MSCI EMU.

“Il tasso di crescita sta sostenendo un‘inversione di rotta negli utili per azione in Europa; ecco perché siamo ‘overweight’ sui titoli europei”, commenta François Savary, chief investment officer di Prime Partners.

Lower gold purchases by India, the world’s second-biggest consumer after China, could drag global prices that have already fallen nearly 6 percent from this year’s peak.

“October imports were lower than last year and even in November and December they are likely to be lower than last year,” Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst with GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters, said on Wednesday.

India’s imports could fall to around 175 tonnes in October-December from 234 tonnes a year ago, Nambiath said.

In the first nine months of 2017, the country’s gold imports surged 131 percent to 638.4 tonnes, according to GFMS data, as jewellers advanced buying in the first half of the year ahead of a sales tax hike that took effect from July 1.

Gold demand usually strengthens in the final quarter as Indians brace for the wedding season as well as festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra, when buying bullion is considered auspicious.

But appetite for the precious metal during Diwali was lower than normal, said Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in Chennai in southern India.

Gold imports last month fell 10 percent from a year ago to 75 tonnes, provisional data from GFMS showed.

“I do not see a big jump in imports in coming months. Overall demand is weak,” said Jayant Pawania, group executive vice president at Yes Bank, a major bullion importer.

Overseas holders of Spanish stocks and bonds -- and indeed owners of euro zone assets in general -- have been quick to dismiss comparisons with a succession of rolling sovereign debt crises that hit the euro zone between 2010 and 2012.

Even though Spain’s wealthiest region has a bigger economy than Greece, Portugal and Finland, relatively unfazed Spanish and Catalonian assets to date shows markets are treating the crisis ovr Catalonia as a largely domestic issue with few if any systemic sovereign, banking or euro wide threats.

While Spain's blue-chip IBEX .IBEX equity index is about 7 percent off the year's highs, it is still up more than 10 percent for 2017 as a whole. The Spanish government's 10-year borrowing costs as well as their risk premium over German equivalents are lower than where they started the year. The euro exchange rate has barely budged.

On one level the scale of financial risk more than gross domestic output of the area is of a different order.

Catalonia’s debt level -- at around 77 billion euros -- is around quarter that of Greece.

In addition, 52.5 billion euros of that -- just over two-thirds -- is owed to Spain, a further 8.175 billion euros to resident financial institutions, 6.018 billion euros to the rest of the world and 10.035 billion euros to others, according to the data from the Spanish central bank.

The international exposure is too small to create ripples across the euro zone even in the event of a Catalonian default, and the effect on Spain would also be limited. Catalonia’s total debt to the center represents just 4.75 percent of the Spain’s total debt as of the end of 2016.

Independence on its own would neither lead to a sovereign default nor to an exit of a existing euro zone member, which caused consternation earlier in the decade given fears of sovereign redenomination risk, related banking stress and legal precedents that seeped across the bloc.

Economic confidence and business risk for Spanish firms and households may be an issue at the margins for equity investors, but this is largely cushioned at the moment by a booming world economy and the fastest economic expansion in the euro zone in more than six years.

The chances of secession itself were always slim. One of the leading investors in Catalonian bonds believes the region’s bid for independence was always legally doubtful.

“Greece was a very different story -– the very existence of Greece as part of the monetary union was called into question. In Catalonia, independence was never constitutional, there was no legal basis,” said Mark Dowding, senior portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management, which has been a long term investor in Catalonian debt.

If ultimately Catalonia’s independence was always unlikely, the rest was just a “storm in a teacup” for financial markets, Dowding said.

Markets did attempt to re-price different elements of the Spanish financial world -- but few of these moves were durable.

The gap between Catalonian ES0000950E= and Spanish ES0000126C= bonds widened rapidly to its highest level in over a year after the banned Oct. 1 independence referendum, as investors fled from the troubled region’s debt.

But now it has not only erased those losses but shrunk to its smallest since mid-July, at 250 basis points.

Spanish banks that had been based in Catalonia, Banco de Sabadell (SABE.MC) and Caixa Bank (CABK.MC), took outsize hits during the worst of the crisis but both since moved their headquarters out of the region and their stock prices are still up more than 20 percent year-to-date.

“This is very different from other crises the euro zone has faced recently,” said Nadia Gharbi, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management. “This is very much an internal issue and a national question for Spain. We don’t think that, as things stand, it will lead to a systemic crisis.”

“Spanish equities have been the category that is most affected; Spanish bonds have seen a relatively modest impact and the euro has been mostly affected by the ECB,” said Nicola Mai, an analyst and portfolio manager at Pimco, the world’s largest bond investor and an owner of Catalonian debt.

The European Central Bank’s ongoing monetary stimulus and bond-buying program helped to subdue some potential volatility.

All South European government debt -- seen as major beneficiaries of the ECB largesse -- have been in demand since and Spain’s 10-year borrowing costs are a good 13 basis points below the level before the Oct. 1. referendum.

“As investors you’re in an environment which frankly looks pretty benign from a volatility perspective,” said Andrew Mulliner, portfolio manager at asset manager Henderson.

The main European volatility index is close to its lowest since well before the 2008 financial crisis. .V2TX

Throughout his 24-hour swing through South Korea, Trump, who in a September speech at the United Nations had threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea and had dismissed dialogue with Pyongyang as a “waste of time”, took a more restrained tone.

In his first trip to South Korea as president, Trump also significantly toned down his criticism of what he once called a “horrible” free trade deal with South Korea. He says now he will “find a fair and reciprocal” deal after earlier threatening to terminate the pact.

The apparent newfound bond between Trump and liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and the U.S. President’s willingness to “make a deal” with North Korea - albeit on his terms - could begin to assuage fears of a catastrophic war with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Trump’s willingness to talk about revising the bilateral trade agreement, rather than scrapping it entirely, could also reassure markets worried about the fallout on major exporters such as Samsung, Hyundai and LG Electronics.

Trump’s speech to South Korea’s National Assembly on Wednesday, interrupted by applause about 20 times with a standing ovation at the end, praised a “free and flourishing” South, in contrast to “the horror of life in North Korea.”

On South Korea’s largest internet portal, Naver.com, some of Moon’s supporters welcomed the address. They said Trump displayed a greater knowledge of the two Koreas than his previous statements had indicated.

“Far from the ‘madman’ the media portrays, Trump came across as perfectly normal, smart, and well-mannered,” read one of the more than 1,200 posts on Naver.com.

Another wrote: “Wow, best speech ever. I feel so safe to have such a great U.S. president who is so determined to resolve North Korean issues.”

Naver.com blocks out the usernames on comments to keep them anonymous.

DEEP U.S. PRESENCE

South Koreans were feeling a little less safe earlier this week when the Pentagon, in a letter to U.S. lawmakers, gave a blunt assessment of what war on the Korea peninsula would look like. A ground invasion would be the only way to locate and secure all North Korea’s nuclear weapons with complete certainty, and Pyongyang could use biological and chemical weapons in any conflict, it said.

Seoul, the densely populated capital with some 25 million residents, lies an hour’s drive from the border.

The U.S. military presence in South Korea has long been seen as a bulwark against the North and its nuclear threat. The United States decisively intervened in the 1950-53 Korean War, which has left the two Korea’s technically still at war, since it ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

While the sprawling U.S. military bases housing some 28,500 troops have not been without controversy - some critics contend they undermine the country’s sovereignty - the U.S. security umbrella is also deeply embedded in the national psyche.

Underscoring the importance Seoul attaches to the alliance at a time of increased tensions with Pyongyang, South Korean officials rolled out a reception fit for the first state visit by an American president in 25 years, according to the presidential Blue House.

Moon, who took office in May, had campaigned for more dialogue with North Korea. He appeared to be the target of criticism from Trump, who said after North Korea’s nuclear test in September: “South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!”

But Moon led a charm offensive, proclaiming a “special bond forged between President Trump and myself” after a lengthy meeting at the presidential Blue House. He personally joined Trump during a tour of a U.S. base, as well as during an ultimately aborted visit to the demilitarized zone on the border with North Korea.

“I wouldn’t say we didn’t have any concerns,” a South Korean government official said. “But the fact that he received a standing ovation (for his speech) could mean that he dispelled such concerns, delivered the message we wanted him to deliver, and wrapped up his trip successfully,” said the official who asked for anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter.

‘NO WAR’

In his speech to the National Assembly, where several lawmakers brandished signs reading “No war, we want peace”, Trump paid homage to the 67-year-old alliance that “divides the oppressed and the free”. He noted that in “less than one lifetime, South Korea climbed from total devastation to among the wealthiest nations on earth”.

Trump also reassured South Koreans the Korean War would not be repeated.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated. And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure,” he said.

And while Trump painted a dystopian picture of life in North Korea, he refrained from any threats of pre-emptive action against the North. On Tuesday, Trump said it would in the North’s interest to “come to the table and to make a deal”.

It all seemed reassuring to an anxious South Korean public.

“I think people might have felt they got to see the real Trump after he visited South Korea,” said Kim Jun-seok, a political science professor at Dongguk University.

Republicans currently control both chambers.","ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife voted at a polling station in Brooklyn on Tuesday, in an election he expects will hand him a second term in office. It's one of several races being contested. New Jersey voters also will pick a new governor to replace outgoing Republican Chris Christie. Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election. Republicans currently control both chambers.","New York Mayor de Blasio votes, seeks second term",https://www.reuters.com/video/2017/11/07/new-york-mayor-de-blasio-votes-seeks-sec?videoId=372922928&newsChannel=politicsNews

The EU will only engage with Britain on its future trade relationship and how a post-Brexit transition period will work, as London wishes, after the first, ongoing round of divorce talks have sufficiently progressed.

Brussels wants three issues broadly solved before giving the green light -- the exit bill, safeguarding expatriate rights and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the UK’s only land frontier with the EU after its departure.

“I‘m now of the view that it is likely that we will be able to say that sufficient progress has been made at the December (EU leaders) meeting, allowing us to move onto discussions on transition and the future arrangements, but that’s just my prediction at this stage,” Leo Varadkar told parliament.

“This of course will all depend on what happens over the next number of weeks and what specific assurances and guarantees in writing we can get from the United Kingdom.”

Varadkar, who said he was more optimistic than he was a number of weeks ago with talks “moving in the right direction”, struck a more positive tone than his foreign minister, Simon Coveney, who said recently that Dublin could not let talks progress without further clarity on the border.

The Irish government has called on Britain to do more than simply promise a “hard” border will not return between it and Northern Ireland, which until a 1998 peace deal was separated by military checkpoints because of 30 years of sectarian violence in the British province.

EU diplomats and officials told Reuters on Tuesday that the continued slow pace of the divorce talks was increasing the possibility that EU leaders would again refuse next month to open trade talks.

They said some may already be considering that as a useful tactic against Britain, which is anxious to prevent businesses relocating investment.

“It’s not going to be possible to fully resolve the border question until we actually start to talk about the future relationship the UK will have with Northern Ireland so there will come a point when it is in our interests to actually start talking about that,” Varadkar said.",Irish PM sees Brexit talks moving to next stage in December,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-ireland/irish-pm-sees-brexit-talks-moving-to-next-stage-in-december-idUSKBN1D81X1?il=0

Analysts said a flattening yield curve at a time when the Federal Reserve is hiking rates is a sign that investors are wary about the sustainability of economic growth and inflation in the world’s biggest economy.

Investors are also nervous about the potential outcome of a Republican plan to cut corporate taxes, unveiled last week. As well as slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the bill would eliminate many tax breaks and is expected to face opposition from interest groups.

Senate Republican leaders are considering a one-year delay in the implementation of a major corporate tax cut to comply with Senate rules, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources.

“I do expect the tax bill to be watered down,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.

“My concern is that the market has fully factored in that a tax bill is going to come to pass and this is still a very difficult road to get this done and there’s not a whole lot of time.”

Republicans are yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

Pre-tax profit for the half year to September fell 5.3 percent, according to the 5 billion pound company’s report on Wednesday. Although the decline was smaller than expected thanks to the performance of M&S stores overseas, Chief Executive Steve Rowe is stepping up the pace of his five-year turnaround plan. Data about customers moving to other stores following closures has been positive, giving him confidence to reduce retail space faster. The fresh urgency in addressing changing consumer habits also bears the hallmark of Archie Norman, the group’s new chairman. It’s a notable shift for a retailer which typically opts for incremental change.

But the group is also paring back the outlook for its food business, which now generates 60 percent of UK sales. Along with discounters Lidl and Aldi, M&S has been one of the few supermarkets aggressively growing its British network. It had planned to add 200 new food stores by early 2019.

On Wednesday, the company said that it will slow the pace of openings. A like-for-like sales decline of 0.1 percent in the six months to the end of September caps at least 10 quarters of feeble growth for the food division. Gross margins are also under pressure from higher costs related to the weaker pound following the UK’s Brexit vote last year.

Statements of support from EU ambassadors to Lebanon and the U.S. State Department on Tuesday struck a sharply different tone to Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon together with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah as parties hostile to it.

Lebanon has been pitched into deep crisis since the Saudi-allied Hariri resigned on Saturday in a speech delivered from Saudi Arabia in which he accused Hezbollah and Iran of sowing strife in the Arab world and cited fear of assassination.

The circumstances surrounding Hariri’s sudden resignation have given rise to speculation in Lebanon that he had been caught up in a high-level anti-corruption purge in Saudi Arabia, where his family made their fortune, and coerced into resigning.

Saudi Arabia has denied this along with reports that it has put Hariri under house arrest. It says he quit because Hezbollah was calling the shots in the government.

The move has pulled Lebanon back to the forefront of a regional struggle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Shi‘ite Islamist government of Iran, a rivalry which has also swept through Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen.

In a statement, the EU ambassadors said they reaffirmed “their strong support for the continued unity, stability, sovereignty, and security of Lebanon and its people”.

They called “on all sides to pursue constructive dialogue and to build on the work achieved in the last 11 months towards strengthening Lebanon’s institutions and preparing parliamentary elections in early 2018, in adherence with the Constitution”.

On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said Lebanon was a strong U.S. partner.

“The United States strongly supports the legitimate institutions in the Lebanese state,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

“We expect all members of the international community to respect fully those institutions and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon,” she said.

The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

But it is also a major sponsor of the Lebanese military, which receives support from Britain as well.

Lebanon has also received significant Western aid to help it cope with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, equivalent to around a quarter of the population.

Hezbollah, set up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is the most powerful group in Lebanon, with a guerrilla army that out guns the national military and major sway in government.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government have responded to accusations made by Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the kingdom.

President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally who took office last year, has refused to accept Hariri’s resignation, saying he first wants him to return to Lebanon so he can meet him in person to understand the reasons. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has said the coalition government led by Hariri still stands.","EU, U.S. affirm Lebanon support, diverging from Saudi",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-lebanon-crisis/eu-u-s-affirm-lebanon-support-diverging-from-saudi-idUKKBN1D8127?il=0

Combs, 48, who has gone by the names Puffy, Diddy and Puff Daddy, made headlines over the weekend by announcing on Instagram that he would answer only to the name Brother Love.

On Monday, he backtracked.

“I was only joking,” Combs said in a new Instagram video. “I didn’t change my name. It was just part of one of my alter egos. One of my alter egos is Love.”

“You can address me by any of my older names. But if you still wanna call me Love, you can call me Love, baby. But I was only playin’,” he added.

Comb’s initial announcement caused a social media frenzy. It also prompted wrestling fans to note that the name Brother Love was already taken by former World Wrestling Entertainment star Bruce Prichard.

“Thank you everyone for helping @diddy see the light! Just so you know Puffy ... I love you,” Prichard tweeted after the reversal by Combs.

Combs founded the Bad Boy Entertainment record label in 1993 that helped launch the careers of rappers like Notorius B.I.G.

Shipping lines normally transship cargoes from the United Arab Emirates port of Jebel Ali to Qatar, which relies heavily on imports by sea and land.

A Maersk Line spokesman said on Tuesday: “We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.”

“We expect disruptions to our Qatar services. The situation is very fluid,” the spokesman said, adding that Maersk would notify customers about alternative options as soon as possible.

The spokesman said the company, which is the world’s biggest container shipping line, was looking at other routes such as Oman.

Larger container ships are unable to dock at ports in Qatar due in part to shallow waters so shipping lines use feeder services, which transport container boxes from the larger port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.

Ports have also been directly affected, which has disrupted trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food.

The ban has meant that any ship sailing to and from Qatar will be prevented from calling at major ports in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which include Jebel Ali, as well as Bahrain.

Food imports have been affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies.

Trade sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.","Maersk says unable to ship Qatar bound cargo from UAE, seeks alternatives",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-shipping/maersk-says-unable-to-ship-qatar-bound-cargo-from-uae-seeks-alternatives-idUSKBN18X1YS

Hackers last month made about $4.4 million in fraudulent transfers from Kathmandu-based NIC Asia Bank to countries including Britain, China, Japan, Singapore and the United States when the bank was closed for annual festival holidays, according to Nepal media reports.

All but $580,000 of the funds were recovered after Nepal asked other nations to block release of the stolen money, Chinta Mani Shivakoti, deputy governor of the Central Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), told Reuters.

Brussels-based SWIFT said last month that security controls instituted after last year’s $81 million theft from Bangladesh’s central bank helped thwart some recent hacking attempts, but it warned that cyber criminals continue to target SWIFT customers.

SWIFT or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is a co-operative owned by its user banks. It declined to comment on the NIC Asia Bank hack, saying it does not discuss specific users.

Representatives with NIC Asia Bank, one of dozens of private banks in Nepal, were not available for comment.

KPMG is also involved in the investigation, according to Nepali media reports. KPMG representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.

The central bank intends to release guidelines on how to thwart such incidents after investigations are completed, according to Shivakoti.

“The incident showed there are some weaknesses with the IT department of the bank,” Shivakoti said.

SWIFT said in a statement on Tuesday that it offers assistance to banks when it learns of potential fraud cases, then shares relevant information with other clients on an anonymous basis.

“This preserves confidentiality, whilst assisting other SWIFT users to take appropriate measures to protect themselves,” it said.

The British-based team said in a preview for Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix that, with nothing at stake, they could afford to become “a little bolder” and experiment in Friday practice.

The experiments could also be carried over into the race for newly-crowned four times world champion Lewis Hamilton and team mate Valtteri Bottas.

“These two final weekends are not only an opportunity to test new parts, but also allow experiments for those tasks that the team simply doesn’t have the opportunity to complete during a normal race weekend,” said Mercedes.

“The team will have an intense program on the next two Fridays in Brazil and Abu Dhabi to make the absolute most of the opportunities that have been afforded by early title success.”

Mercedes won the constructors’ championship for the fourth year in a row in Texas last month while Hamilton, now Britain’s most successful driver of all time, took his fourth title in Mexico.

Mercedes said they would be using prominent aerodynamic devices, of the type usually seen in pre-season testing and which carry extra weight, in Friday practice.

They will also test some new pit-stop equipment and techniques in live conditions for the first time.

Team boss Toto Wolff said there would be no easing up when it came to racing, however.

Revolut, which has offered a pre-paid cash card since 2015, is one of a number of smaller upstart finance firms hoping that coming regulation and technology can help it break the dominance of bigger banks.

Financial technology firms like Revolut are trying to chip away at traditional banks by offering users slick apps, slashed fees and an instant overview of their finances. From challenger banks to digital currencies like Bitcoin, the British government regards the ‘fintech’ sector as a key source of growth.

Changes coming into force in Britain and across the European Union will see banks forced to open up their closely held customer data to rivals, who will be able to use it to build products and better target clients.

Peers like Britain’s Starling Bank and Monzo and Germany’s N26 have already secured banking licenses ahead of the new rules.

“Even without a banking license, we have attracted over 950,000 users across Europe, many of whom consider Revolut as their primary current account and spending card,” said Nikolay Storonsky, Revolut’s founder and CEO.

The firm’s tagline promises an experience “beyond banking”, but so far it has been unable to offer some of the core services provided by banks, including current accounts, overdrafts, loans and direct debits.

It expects to receive a license effective in the first half of 2018 and to start offering these services in select markets straightaway.

It said it has applied for its license through the Lithuanian central bank and has sufficient capital in place.

Current accounts and credit will initially be available to users in Lithuania, before being rolled out to Estonia and Latvia and, as soon as possible, Britain. Next in line are France, Germany and Italy and eventually the rest of the European Union, the firm said.

Fintech lender Cashplus said last week it was considering applying for a UK banking license, while telecoms giant Orange has launched its own bank in France in a bid to steal established lenders’ market share by capitalizing on the rise of smartphones.

But incumbent banks are stepping up investment in their own digital platforms too.

It doesn't get much clearer than this.>> The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger.>> US President Donald Trump delivering a direct message to Kim Jong-un on Wednesday, during a speech on North Korea at the National Assembly in Seoul.

Do not underestimate us and do not try us.>> He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it any forms of support, supply or acceptance and as Reuters Soi Yung Kim explains his words were pointed.>> His criticism was much more wide ranging including harsher tax on North Korea's human rights records.

>> Torture, starvation, rape, and murder.>> North Korea's response to those particular comments will be interesting to see, because Trump here try to make a clear distinction between what he called a brutal leadership, and poor ordinary people>> Last time Kim Jong-un used Trump's UN speech as his propaganda tool because on Trump without distinction threatened to destroy North Korea.

But this time around, Trump made a clear distinction between the two, so Kim might have taken it much more insulting than before.>> It's a return to harsh language, just a day after he appeared to dial back some of his rhetoric. On Tuesday, he even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang, to make a deal.

But his actions said something else. Just before the speech, the U.S. President attempted to make an unannounced visit to the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The doorstep of the North Korean nuclear standoff. Officially the trip was cancelled due to a dense fog. Though with growing fears of a military conflict, there's no doubt that a trip to the DMZ would've had the potential to further inflame tensions with the North.",Trump warns North Korea 'Do not try us',https://www.reuters.tv/v/pCh/2017/11/08/trump-warns-north-korea-do-not-try-us

Ahead of the election, some market strategists found it difficult to plan financially for Trump’s possible presidency, in part because many of his proposals were seen as contradictory or lacking in detail.

However, at the close of trading of that session, Dow futures had reversed the drop to close up nearly 250 points, above 18,500.

That is the lowest they have been since then.

Despite not having a single major legislative victory and with prospects for a government shutdown in December looming, stocks have not looked back in the Trump era.

The S&P 500 .SPX is up 21.1 percent since the 2016 election, while the Dow .DJI has gained 28.5 percent in that period and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC is up 30.3 percent.

Banks and technology have been the best performers over the past year, with telecommunication services the weakest performer.

The Dow has closed at a record high more than 70 times since election day 2016 and the S&P 500 has closed at a record on 52 days in 2017 -the fifth-most in any year, but it could challenge the 59 record closes in 1928 for third place or the 62 in 1964 for second, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The year with the most S&P record closing highs is 1995 with 77. There were 53 in 2014.

Economic growth across the globe, alongside stimulative monetary policy from the world's largest central banks, have been behind the market's rally. The expectation of pro-growth and business-friendly policies from the Trump administration as well as bets on deregulation, gave investors further reasons to invest in stocks.

Even though the shares are non-voting, the two companies have excellent reasons to connect.

After a dismal quarter that wiped out another one-fifth of Snap’s market value in after-hours trading on Tuesday, it’s no wonder the company revealed Tencent’s enlarged stake. It didn’t have to, as Snap made perfectly clear in documents submitted to regulators. Its multi-class share structure, which is so abysmal it has inspired stock-index creators to reject the company from inclusion, excuses it from having to notify investors of any changes.

Getting revenge on throngs of short-sellers can’t have been the only reason. It’s also helpful for Snap to let rivals like Facebook know it has a new deep-pocketed backer. Worth some $469 billion, Tencent is a more formidable force than Snap, whose shares are trading below the price at which they debuted in March. Snap also said it “looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences” with the Shenzhen-based company, which has found creative ways with payments and games to keep nearly one billion users glued to WeChat.

Tencent has been slowly striking U.S. allegiances, including with Tesla, as it plots global expansion. It also has a vested interest in making sure that Facebook, which freely copies Snapchat features and rolls them out on its own apps, has some stiff competition on its home turf. And while there are no clear signs that Beijing intends to give Mark Zuckerberg’s powerhouse an entry visa, if it happened it would pose a competitive threat.

Facebook is trying to crack China’s massive market, where it has been banned for years. It quietly released a photo-sharing app in the People’s Republic called Colorful Balloons, according to the New York Times, and has been scouting for office space in Shanghai. Zuckerberg, who has been studying Mandarin, was in the country just last month.

The failure by Prime Minister Theresa May to win a parliamentary majority in last week's election has pushed the world's fifth largest economy toward a level of political uncertainty not seen since the 1970s.

May called the election to secure a mandate for her vision of a “hard Brexit” -- driving down migration by taking Britain out of the single market and the customs union.

Instead, she got a hung parliament in which no single party has a majority. Business leaders demanded a re-think.

“The UK has had a reputation, earned over the generations, for stability and predictability in its government,” a senior executive at a multi-national company listed on the London FTSE 100 told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

“That reputation in 12 months has been destroyed, truly destroyed. First by Brexit and now through this election.”

A survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found only 20 percent of its nearly 700 members were now optimistic about the British economy over the next 12 months, compared with 57 percent who were quite or very pessimistic.

The IoD survey, taken after the election, found a negative swing of 34 points in confidence in the economy from its previous survey in May.

“It is hard to overstate what a dramatic impact the current political uncertainty is having on business leaders, and the consequences could – if not addressed immediately – be disastrous for the UK economy,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the IoD.

The collapse in confidence, which follows a short-term drop after last year’s Brexit vote, coincides with a slowdown in the wider economy that has taken hold since the start of this year, as rising inflation pushes up the price of goods.

Figures from credit card firm Visa showed British consumers turned more cautious even before the shock election result, with households cutting their spending for the first time in nearly four years last month.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) warned there was now a risk businesses would cut back on investment which has largely held up since last year’s Brexit vote.

And the trade group that represents manufacturers, the EEF, said its members were having to navigate the most uncertain political territory in Britain for decades.

Both groups called on the government to rethink its approach to Brexit, saying the country needed tariff-free access to the single market and a steady flow of migrant workers.

Some executives hoped the political paralysis would lead to a ‘softer Brexit’, with access to markets prioritized over a clamp down on immigration.

“Here we are again: another bolt from the blue, a political earthquake that we didn’t think used to happen in the UK,” CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation.

“But I do think there are opportunities in this, and it is an opportunity to refocus back on the economy to talk about jobs, growth, future prosperity.”

Having slid to its lowest for nearly two months against the dollar on Friday, the pound fell broadly again on Monday.

LEFT IN LIMBO

Business executives warned the political uncertainty could be felt across a wave of sectors.

Leaders of the drugs industry warned of the hazards of government limbo at a critical time for the highly regulated sector as companies seek clarity on the rules that will govern their business after Brexit.

Andy Bruce, the CEO of Lookers (LOOK.L), one of Britain’s biggest car dealerships, said the lack of a clear result meant the highly successful industry had now entered “uncharted waters” in terms of how many new cars it could sell.

And Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP (WPP.L), the world’s largest advertising agency, told Reuters he feared increased economic uncertainty, which meant “weak investment and postponement of decision making.”

“Now it seems that we could have no deal because of the short time fuse and lack of decisive government decision making, or a soft Brexit, the latter with more movement and membership of the single market,” he said.

Bankers, at the heart of London’s huge financial center, cautioned of the impact on takeover activity.

“So long as uncertainty is there I don’t see that as particularly positive for M&A in the short term,” Karen Cook, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs said at the Reuters Global M&A summit.

Gareth Vale, marketing director at recruitment group Manpower, said its clients were very apprehensive, and had not yet fully grasped the impact that Brexit would have.

“I think the uncertainty around Brexit, and more recently the general election, has created a sense of almost inertia, which has prevented them from considering some of the bigger seismic shifts that are on the horizon.”",Business confidence plummets as political crisis grips Britain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-economy/business-confidence-plummets-as-political-crisis-grips-britain-idUSKBN1931P9

That transformation - marketed as “Beyond Petroleum” - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP (BP.L) might be more aptly branded “Back to Petroleum” after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn’t get a buyer.

“We made very big bets in the past,” BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. “A lot of those didn’t work. We’re not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable.”

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world’s biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

“There is no sign of peak demand right now,” said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. “For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth.”

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal’s contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil’s one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors’ decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

“There isn’t a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,” he said. “We’re not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil.”

The confidence in oil’s future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron’s analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors’ cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

“You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another,” he said. “Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels.”

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms’ shareholders have come to expect.

“We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model,” said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP’s CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

“It will take time,” he said in an interview with Reuters last month. “And they have time.”

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls “new energies.”

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway’s North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

“When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first,” he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, “could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers.”

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn’t detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry’s largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Ford Motor Co (F.N) earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids.

A startup backed by Boeing Co (BA.N) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp (6752.T).

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

BP projects the world’s auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

“We’ll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn’t require large subsidies” from governments, Chevron’s Watson told Reuters. “That’s what we’re seeing now.”",Peak oil?

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew 500 ($7.5) and 1,000 rupee ($15) notes from circulation on Nov. 8 last year in a bid to flush out cash hidden from the tax man and push the country toward digital transactions.

Modi got broad support for the move and his party scored a landslide win in a crucial election that followed. But an economic slowdown and job losses that resulted have given the opposition ammunition to attack his administration.

In recent days, government ministers have come out in full force calling demonetization a success, celebrating the anniversary as “anti-black money day”.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Facebook that India’s dependence on cash had fallen by nearly 3.89 trillion rupees. Cash to GDP ratio is now near 9 percent of gross domestic product, compared with nearly 12 percent before demonetization.

About 5.6 million new taxpayers had been added to the tax net, the finance ministry said. And Reserve Bank of India data shows transaction volumes through mobile wallets, such as PayTM and MobiKwik, jumped after demonetization to a high of 320.87 million in April, from 99.57 million in October.

But the move is widely blamed for contributing to a broad slowdown of the economy, which has hit its lowest level in three years. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai based think tank, estimated that about 1.5 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017 due to demonetization.

On Wednesday, the opposition Congress party held protests in major cities.

“It has ruined the lives of millions of hard-working Indians,” Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said in a message on Twitter.

The pain from demonetization is also being felt in neighbouring Nepal, where thousands of migrant workers still have old currency notes that they could not exchange before the window to do so closed.

Chinta Mani Shivakoti, deputy governor of Nepal’s central bank, Nepal Rastra Bank, said they were still waiting for Indian authorities’ response to exchange nearly 55 million Indian currency notes held by its citizens. Business associations estimate the value of the notes at 10 billion rupees.

The spending forecast, an increase from 2017 levels and higher than many Wall Street analysts had expected, comes as Conoco, like some peers, focuses more on generating profits than on boosting production at any cost.

Much of that discipline is aided by better technology and more efficient processes that help the company pump more for less. The company expects production to grow 5 percent each year for the rest of the decade.

Executive said they should be able to send more than 30 percent of cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks by 2020.

New York police identified the assailant as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old Uzbek national, who left a handwritten note in the truck that pledged his allegiance to Islamic State. American security officials did not immediately find evidence that directly tied Saipov with Islamic State. So far, U.S. officials consider him as a “lone wolf” attacker who was inspired by the militant group, but not directed by its leaders or operatives.

“The gist of the note was that the Islamic State would endure forever,” John Miller, New York’s deputy police commissioner, said at news conference on Wednesday. “He appears to have followed almost exactly the instructions that ISIS has put out on its social media channels to its followers.”

Inspired by Islamic State’s detailed propaganda, these lone wolf assailants have turned trucks and other vehicles into highly effective killing machines.

U.S. officials say Saipov appears to have followed instructions distributed by Islamic State in one of its magazines, Rumiyah (Arabic for “Rome”), which in November 2016 called on sympathizers to carry out truck attacks against Western targets. It also urged followers to leave behind notes declaring support for the group and its leaders.

With the fall of Mosul and Raqqa, the last urban centers under Islamic State’s control in Syria and Iraq, the group has now lost most of the territory it once dominated. It’s tempting to assume that the group has been defeated. But it poses a new threat: as a militant organization that can still exploit social media and recruit sympathizers around the world to kill in its name. Islamic State will now invest more of its resources in a “leaderless jihad” that does not need a physical state.

The severe loss of territory in Iraq and Syria means that routes for foreign jihadists to reach the self-declared caliphate have evaporated. But the group still has the capability to attract recruits, raise funds, secure weapons and inspire sympathizers to carry out attacks around the world.

While Islamic State has organized assaults that required months of training and planning -- such as the November 2015 attacks in central Paris, which killed 130 people -- it has moved steadily toward inspiring loosely coordinated and sometimes haphazard attacks by self-radicalized perpetrators.

The latest wave of attacks fits into appeals by Islamic State’s leaders for their supporters to carry out self-directed assaults that use any means necessary -- including trucks, cars, knives and axes -- to kill civilians, especially in the West.

These lone wolf attacks are the result of an organized, decade-old movement within Islamic jihadism to decentralize attacks and make them more diffuse. This trend predated the emergence of Islamic State, and it can be traced back to al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Some of al Qaeda’s leaders were worried that the U.S.-led war after Sept. 11 would hamper their ability to carry out centrally planned attacks, so they sought ways for sympathizers to act on their own.

Islamic State expanded that strategy far beyond al Qaeda’s original conception. In relying on lone wolf attacks by individuals who are self-radicalized and have only a tangential understanding of jihadist ideology, Islamic State is able to project a greater reach than it actually has.

In September 2014, Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, at the time the Islamic State’s top spokesman, issued an audiotaped appeal that explained these new tactics. Adnani, who was killed two years later in a U.S. air strike in Syria, urged the group’s sympathizers to use whatever means at their disposal to attack American and French citizens, and virtually any other Western civilians. “If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies,” he said. “Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him.”

Since Adnani’s statement, it became clear that Islamic State would adopt the “leaderless jihad” strategy. For two years, the group has inspired lone attackers to act in its name, especially in the West. These attacks allowed Islamic State’s leaders to create an illusion of strength to make up for their battlefield losses.

In recent months, Islamic State has quickly claimed responsibility for a spate of attacks on civilians in Europe -- especially in Britain and France -- and in the Middle East. In March, a driver mowed down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing five people before being shot by security forces as he tried to break into Parliament. In May, a suicide bomber killed 22 in an attack on a concert arena in Manchester.

In June, three assailants sped across London Bridge in a van, killing eight by ramming into pedestrians and stabbing people with hunting knives. And in August, suicide attackers stormed a Shi’ite mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, killing at least 30 worshipers and wounding dozens.

The threat extends beyond the West and the Middle East. Islamic State fighters from Southeast Asia -- including some who recently battled Philippine security forces in the city of Marawi during a five-month siege -- are starting to return home, especially to Malaysia and Indonesia. These militants would pose a threat because of their battlefield experience, guerrilla warfare training and networks they established while fighting in Iraq and Syria.

To combat this more complex range of threats posed by Islamic State and its sympathizers, governments throughout the world will need to do more than simply continue military strikes against targets in Iraq and Syria. It will also mean greater vigilance in monitoring clandestine networks set up by Islamic State operatives -- and adjusting to a new enemy that is constantly adapting its methods.",Commentary: NY truck attack part of Islamic State’s ‘leaderless jihad’,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bazzi-afterislamicstate-commentary/commentary-ny-truck-attack-part-of-islamic-states-leaderless-jihad-idUSKBN1D162G

Dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have already been held in the purge announced on Saturday. They face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain.

But the sources, speaking on Wednesday, said a number of other individuals suspected of wrongdoing were detained in an expansion of the crackdown, widely seen as an initiative of the powerful heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Others under scrutiny are being telephoned by investigators about their finances but appear to remain at liberty, one of the sources said, adding that the number of people targeted by the crackdown was expected eventually to rise into the hundreds.

The number of domestic bank accounts frozen as a result of the purge is over 1,700 and rising, up from 1,200 reported on Tuesday, banking sources said.

A number of those held most recently include individuals with links to the immediate family of the late Crown Prince and Defence Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz who died in 2011, the sources said.

STOCKS FALL

Others appear to be lower-level managers and officials, one of the sources said.

Many Saudis have cheered the purge as an attack on the theft of state funds by the rich, and U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years”.

But some Western officials expressed apprehension at the possible ramifications for the secretive tribal and royal politics of the world’s largest oil exporter.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market continued to fall in early trade on Wednesday because of concern about the economic impact of its anti-corruption purge. The Saudi index .TASI was 1.0 percent lower after half an hour of trade. Shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation slid further.

Late on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi central bank sought to ease worries about the crackdown.

They said that while individuals were being targeted and having their bank accounts frozen, national and multinational companies - including those wholly or partly owned by individuals under investigation - would not be disrupted.

Anti-corruption authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of the most senior members of the ruling Al Saud, and some of his immediate family members, the sources added.

Prince Mohammed, or MbN as he is known, was ousted as Crown Prince in June when King Salman replaced him with the then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Since Sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.

RIGHTS CONCERNS

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since his ousting at the funeral on Tuesday for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

Among business executives detained in the probe so far are billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE; Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar, founder of Al Tayyar Travel 1810.SE; and Amr al-Dabbagh, chairman of builder Red Sea International 4230.SE.

The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had urged Saudi Arabia to carry out any prosecution of officials detained in a “fair and transparent” manner.

Commenting on the purge, Human Rights Watch called on Saudi authorities to “immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person’s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights”.

“It’s great that Saudi authorities are declaring that they want to take on the scourge of corruption, but the right way to do that is through diligent judicial investigations against actual wrongdoing, not sensationalistic mass arrests to a luxury hotel,” Right Watch official Sarah Leah Whitson in a statement.",Saudi Arabia makes fresh arrests in anti-graft crackdown: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1D81FL

Instead, many firms will talk up efforts to extract new revenues out of powerful data-crunching services, while the first Paris display of a U.S. stealth jet in decades, the F-35, points to a defense recovery at the world’s largest air show.

The meeting also comes amid tensions in the Gulf over a transport and economic boycott of Qatar that is fuelling questions over the resilience of a major source of demand.

Dominating an otherwise thin slate of commercial orders will be a new version of Boeing’s (BA.N) most-sold airliner, the 737.

The 190-to-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10, designed to narrow a gap against European rival Airbus, will be launched on Monday with over 100 orders, two people familiar with the plans said.

Analysts said one unknown quantity is how many of the MAX 10 orders may merely be replacing previous orders for other variants as Boeing rejigs its medium-haul portfolio.

Low-cost giants Lion Air of Indonesia and Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA.I) have confirmed Reuters reports of interest in the new jet, though talks with Ryanair could take longer to complete.

CDB Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of China Development Bank, is in talks to place orders with both Boeing and Airbus and could complete at least one of the deals by the show.

It may buy 40-50 Boeings, including about 5 MAX 10s, and a similar number of Airbus jets, two sources said.

Boeing is seen anxious to win backing of major operators for the new catch-up model and has also talked to United Airlines.

""I think you'll see some activity on this in Paris and that will start the process of seeing how airlines react to it,"" said Peter Barrett, chief executive of SMBC Aviation Capital.

‘DIFFERENT DYNAMIC’

Seeking to leapfrog Airbus (AIR.PA) after a mixed few years for the MAX series, Boeing will also give more details on a larger new mid-market jet employing a novel fuselage designed to try to capture projected growth in demand for 220-270 seaters.

But few expect a repeat of the more than 400 orders and commitments at last year’s Farnborough Airshow in Britain.

“I think it is going to be a relatively quiet air show compared to previous years,” said Robert Martin, chief executive of BOC Aviation.

Instead, some of the airlines that have become synonymous with air show hoopla in previous years, such as Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL), may return to sign up for digital services to make their new fleets more efficient to operate and maintain.

Manufacturers are exploiting breakthroughs in data storage and other technologies to cut development times by a third while offering services like “predictive maintenance” to airlines, mimicking the post-sales success of their engine suppliers.

“We have 10,000 aircraft flying and we have to apply these technologies to these aircraft,” Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier said.

It will also be the first air show since China and Russia successfully flew new passenger jets in recent weeks, completing a series of debuts by new entrants that also include Japan.

Mitsubishi’s MRJ90 will appear in Paris for the first time.

While there is no immediate threat to Airbus and Boeing, delegates say the feeling is taking hold in boardrooms and governments that their duopoly cannot be taken for granted.

“There is a long road from first flight to certification and all that goes with it, but I think it will be a slightly different dynamic than we might have had in previous air shows where they were paper or theoretical airplanes and now we have real aircraft,” Barrett said of the would-be challengers.

In another turning point, it may be the last major air show for Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who has said he will retire soon. He has presided over sales of over 10,000 planes.

With the New Yorker’s departure, the swagger and deliberate baiting of rivals at such shows may become a thing of the past, but the industry is unlikely to retreat from fierce competition.

The more muted tone, and cost-cutting to focus on production after years of strong sales, are reflected in the logistics. Several firms have cut back space and host planemaker Airbus is halving staff attendance and slashing catering, insiders said.",Jetmakers hunt for new growth as order binge fizzles out,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-paris/jetmakers-hunt-for-new-growth-as-order-binge-fizzles-out-idUSKBN1961WV

But the Senate report also asked Nigeria’s central bank to sanction Stanbic IBTC Bank “for improper documentations in respect of capital repatriation and loan repayments” on behalf of MTN.

Parliament’s upper house agreed in September last year to investigate whether Africa’s biggest telecoms firm unlawfully repatriated $13.92 billion from Nigeria - its most lucrative market which generates a third of its revenue - between 2006 and 2016.

A spokesman for MTN said: “We welcome the report. We will study it in more detail. As we’ve placed on record previously, we have always insisted that our actions have been compliant with the law in this regard.”

Stanbic IBTC did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.

The senate investigation did not receive proof of collusion to contravene Nigeria’s foreign exchange laws, according to the report.

“There was evidence of massive capital outflow but that fact alone is not conclusive that a crime has been committed,” the report said.

As for the Central Bank of Nigeria, the senate committee said its failure to properly regulate foreign exchange should be condemned.

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in the world, for the third consecutive year, is Stanford University. Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Stanford has long played a key role in the development of our modern networked world: A Stanford professor designed the basic communication standard for the Internet, and university alumni founded some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Netflix. Today the university continues to consistently produce original research and technology. Innovations that originate at Stanford are frequently cited by researchers elsewhere in academia and in private industry. Those are key criteria in the ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of numerous indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

MORE FROM REUTERS TOP 100 Compare Institutions | Methodology

Overall, the top ranks of The World's Most Innovative Universities remain largely unchanged, with nine of last year’s 10 highest-ranked universities remaining in the top 10. And the most elite institutions are almost all large, well-established universities based in the United States and Western Europe. Rounding out the top three are MIT and Harvard, which have held onto their respective 2nd and 3rd place rankings for the past three years. In fourth place is the University of Pennsylvania, which climbed four spots from #8 last year. The highest ranked university outside the U.S., Belgium’s KU Leuven (#5), is a nearly 600-year-old institution that maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet.

In contrast, there are only two Asian universities in the top 20, both of which are based in South Korea, and one of them actually teaches the majority of its classes in English: South Korea’s KAIST, formerly the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, ranked #6. Established in 1971 by the Korean government, KAIST was modeled after engineering schools in the United States, and initially funded with a multimillion-dollar loan from the United States Agency for International Development.

Overall, the top 100 consists of 51 universities based in North America, 26 in Europe, 20 in Asia and 3 in the Middle East. Why does Asia underperform? One reason is because Japanese universities – traditionally the research powerhouses of the region – depend heavily on government R&D spending, and the nation has been undergoing deflation and economic stagnation for more than 20 years. That means less money for research and fewer innovations.

According to data from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science, which tracks articles published in scientific journals, Japanese researchers accounted for 8.4% of all papers published in 2005, but only 5.2% in 2015. Key research areas such as computer science showed even larger decreases, with the number of published papers falling by more than 37%. As a result, the Reuters ranking shows significant declines in rank for leading Japanese universities, including the University of Tokyo (down five spots to #21), Osaka University (down 13 to #24), and Keio University (down 25 to #78). Japan had nine universities on the list in 2016, but only has eight this year; six of those eight universities saw their rank fall from 2016, and one was unchanged. Only Kyushu University saw its ranking improve, moving from #79 to #68.

Of course, while Japan struggles, other Asian nations are growing fast. China has gone from one university on the list in 2015 to two in 2016, and now three in 2017. The two Chinese universities returning to the list this year both made significant gains (Tsinghua University climbed 15 spots to #51, and Peking University climbed 10 spots to #60); the third, Zhejiang University, appears on the list for the first time at #100. But given China’s massive population and economy, just three universities out of 100 still represents significant underperformance.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the world’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations – including educational institutions, nonprofit charities and government-funded labs – that publish the most academic research. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries), and ranked them based on their performance.

Slideshow (8 Images)

Careful observers might note a few differences between how non-U.S. institutions rank on Reuters’ regional innovation lists, Asia’s Most Innovative Universities and Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and how they rank on the global innovators list. An institution’s relative ranking may change from list to list, since each ranking is dependent on summarizing 10 indicators and comparing that with others in a specific population; when that population changes, individual rankings might change as well. Furthermore, the global list is restricted to institutions that filed 70 or more patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization during the five-year period examined by Thomson Reuters. The cutoff for regional lists is just 50 patents, allowing a more in-depth view of the most active institutions within a limited geographic area.

Due to changes in the methodology of this year’s list, three university systems that were ranked in the top 100 last year (University of London, State University System of Florida and University of Arizona and Board of Regents) were broken up so that each of their member institutions were ranked individually: As a result, four of those constituent universities – the University of Florida (#66), University College London (#67), Florida State University (#76) and Arizona State University (#85) – made the top 100 for the first time.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university – or whether it appears on the list at all – does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s best theoretical physics departments, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the planet. All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

Statements of support from EU ambassadors to Lebanon and the United States have set a different tone to their Sunni Gulf ally Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon together with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah as parties hostile to it.

Lebanon has been pitched into deep crisis since the Saudi-allied Saad al-Hariri resigned on Saturday in a speech delivered from Saudi Arabia in which he accused Hezbollah and Iran of sowing strife in the Arab world and cited fear of assassination.

The circumstances surrounding Hariri’s sudden resignation have given rise to wide speculation that he had been caught up in a high-level anti-corruption purge in Saudi Arabia, where his family made their fortune, and coerced into resigning.

Saudi Arabia has denied this along with reports that it has put Hariri under house arrest. It says he quit because Hezbollah was calling the shots in the government.

The move has pulled Lebanon back to the forefront of a regional struggle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Shi‘ite Islamist government of Iran, a rivalry which has also swept through Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen.

It has plunged Lebanon into political crisis and hit market confidence in the heavily indebted Lebanese state. A sell off of Lebanese bonds continued for a third day on Wednesday, with some of them hitting their lowest ever levels.

The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon said on Wednesday the United States remained “committed to a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous Lebanon” during a meeting with Lebanese army commander General Joseph Aoun, a U.S. embassy statement said.

The meeting was to announce a U.S. government reimbursement of $42.9 million for border operations conducted by the Lebanese army, a major recipient of U.S. military aid.

The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group even as it supports the weak Lebanese state, drawing a line between the two in a long-standing policy.

On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said Lebanon was a strong U.S. partner. “The United States strongly supports the legitimate institutions in the Lebanese state,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

“We expect all members of the international community to respect fully those institutions and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon,” she said.

In a statement, EU ambassadors to Lebanon said they reaffirmed “their strong support for the continued unity, stability, sovereignty, and security of Lebanon and its people”.

SYRIAN REFUGEES

Lebanon has also received significant Western aid to help it cope with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, equivalent to around a quarter of the population.

Hezbollah, set up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is the most powerful group in Lebanon, with major sway in government and a guerrilla army that outguns the national military.

The group’s role has grown beyond Lebanon in recent years, and its fighters have provided critical support to President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government have responded to accusations made by Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the kingdom.

President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally who took office last year, has refused to accept Hariri’s resignation, saying he first wants him to return to Lebanon so he can meet him in person to understand the reasons.

Aoun said Lebanon’s security and economy were stable and the presidency still viewed Hariri as prime minister, Lebanese media reported. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has said the coalition government led by Hariri still stands.

NEW PM NOT SEEN LIKELY IN SHORT TERM

Lebanese policymakers and bankers say there is no concern for the Lebanese pound - which has been pegged against the U.S. dollar at the same rate for two decades - thanks to record levels of foreign currency reserves.

Banking sources say there was more demand than usual for converting Lebanese pound savings into dollars when banks opened on Monday. But they said this was not unexpected and is at minimal levels.

Lebanon’s June 2020 bond, and its April 2020 issue both fell to their lowest ever levels on Wednesday.

“Yields could come down, if a new Prime Minister is found quickly and the government can get back to business, but this doesn’t appear to be likely in the short term,” said Carmen Altenkirch, emerging market sovereign analyst at Axa Investment Managers.

Byblos Bank’s Chief Economist Nassib Ghobril said: “We’ve had worse cases when we saw pressure on the actual peg of Lebanese pound to U.S. dollar but it takes a severe shock of the magnitude of the (former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri) assassination in 2005 or the 2006 Israeli war to put real pressure on the currency peg.”","EU, U.S. affirm Lebanon support, diverging from Saudi",https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1D811H-OCATP

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do.

The measures -- which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting Canada -- were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Among those targeted are Alexander Bastrykin, Russia’s top investigator and a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States blacklisted him in January 2017, citing Magnitsky’s death.

“Today’s announcement sends a clear message that Canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights,” said Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

Moscow said last month it would retaliate if Canada banned individuals under the new law.

The Russian embassy in Ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as “absolutely pointless and reprehensible”.

Canada has repeatedly condemned Moscow over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other Western nations.

The United States adopted a law in 2012 freezing any U.S. assets of Russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of Magnitsky. In retaliation, Moscow barred Americans from adopting Russian children.

But the plan faces stiff opposition from nations with big automotive industries, with German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel warning on Tuesday that stricter emissions rules could cost growth and jobs.

The European Commission’s proposal aims to curb greenhouse gases from transport as part of a drive to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

The EU’s executive is keen for legislation to stimulate European industry to develop electric vehicles, afraid that it is falling behind China, Japan and the United States.

“The competition is here,” Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said, citing the use of Chinese electric cars by Brussels taxis firms. “The car was invented in Europe and I believe it should be reinvented here.”

The proposal calls for a 30 percent reduction in the average CO2 emission of carmakers’ fleets by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. It also sets an interim goal of a 15 percent reduction by 2025 to help ensure automakers start investments early.

If they are found in breach of new rules, carmakers face potential fines in the millions of euros, with penalties set at 95 euros for every gram of CO2 above the limit and for each new vehicle registered in that year.

Inspired by Californian climate policy, the draft bill would allow carmakers to offset their overall target if the share of zero and low-emission vehicles in their fleet surpasses a benchmark set by regulators.

The bar for low-emissions vehicles is set at 50 grams per kilometer - ruling out most hybrid vehicles.

Unlike California’s system - viewed by many in the sector as the leading laboratory for policy on electric cars - EU regulators shied away from quotas. There is also no penalty for failing to meet the zero-emission vehicle benchmark.

Heralding tough negotiations with member states and the European Parliament before the bill becomes law, companies called the proposals too ambitious, while environmental campaigners and consumer groups said they did not go far enough.

The European carmakers lobby ACEA said the 30 percent target was “overly challenging” and the 2025 interim target did not give the industry enough time to make changes.

“The current proposal is very aggressive when we consider the low and fragmented market penetration of alternatively-powered vehicles across Europe,” Erik Jonnaert, ACEA secretary general, said in a statement.

In a nod to manufacturers’ concerns, the Commission is set to earmark 800 million euros ($928 million) to support the rollout of charging points for electric vehicles and 200 million euros for battery development.

Outrage over Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) cheating of U.S. emissions tests has put pressure on EU regulators to tighten controls, with several European governments and cities announcing bans of combustion-engine cars in the next two decades.

“We want the European automotive industry get back in the race for global leadership on clean vehicles,” EU climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said its analysis showed a more ambitious CO2 target would foster the uptake of electrified vehicles.

“From a technical standpoint, more progress is definitely possible,” said Peter Mock, the ICCT’s EU managing director.

The Commission also set targets for public authorities to source a percentage of either low emission or zero emission vehicles in their public procurement by 2030, for example garbage trucks.","EU plans credits, fines to boost low-emission car production",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-autos-emissions/eu-plans-credits-fines-to-boost-low-emission-car-production-idUKKBN1D80ZM?il=0

The players arrested were freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, according to USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and ESPN, all of which cited unnamed sources familiar with the incident. Ball is the younger brother of National Basketball Association rookie Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Reached by telephone at a hotel in the eastern city of Hangzhou on Wednesday, Ball declined to comment. ESPN said the three had been picked up by police at their hotel on Tuesday and released on bail early on Wednesday. They were confined to their hotel pending legal proceedings, it said.

The University of California, Los Angeles, declined to confirm the arrests but said it was “aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China”.

“The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,” UCLA Athletics said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Shana Wilson.

The UCLA team had arrived in China on Sunday with plans to play Georgia Tech in both teams’ regular-season opener on Saturday, according to statements from both teams.

It traveled to Hangzhou, about three hours by bus from Shanghai, to visit the campus of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), sponsor of the annual Pac-12 games in China.

The three players were questioned about stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the hotel where the team is staying, ESPN said. UCLA representatives, including coach Steve Alford, were at the police station while they were there, it said, citing an unidentified source.

Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement the conference was “disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about.”

“Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation,” he said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday the Chinese government had reported the case to the U.S. side in accordance with consular agreements.

“China is handling this case in accordance with the law and will guarantee the lawful rights in accordance with the law of those involved in this case,” she said.

In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Arash Markazi, a senior writer at ESPN, LaVar Ball said his son, LiAngelo, would be fine.

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

South Africa remains scarred by glaring income disparities and a jobless rate of over 27 percent. The social grants keep millions from going hungry.

Cash Paymaster Services, a unit of technology company Net1 unit, had distributed the payments, but a new provider had to be found after South Africa’s highest court ruled five years ago that the tender process to acquire the service was unlawful.

The court in March extended Cash Paymaster’s contract by a year, averting a crisis that had almost seen payments cut off. That gave South Africa’s Social Security Agency (SASSA) until the end of March next year to find another provider. The South African Post Office (SAPO) will now fill part of that role.

The communications service said in a statement that a decision had been taken “to fast-track the introduction of an integrated payment system, which will be provided by government through a partnership between SASSA and SAPO.”

The issue had South Africans on edge earlier this year as a deadline loomed in March for SASSA to find a replacement for Cash Paymaster Services, a deadline it missed.

Secondo quanto spiegato oggi agli analisti, la migrazione dei fondi di fondi porterà un incremento dei margini consolidati al netto delle tasse di circa 20 punti base, i singoli fondi e building block (classe istituzionale) di circa 34/42 punti base, i singoli fondi (classe retail) di 5/7 punti base e i bulding block (classe retail) di circa 25 punti base.

“Diventiamo molto più efficienti, più in controllo della catena di costruzione dei prodotti di modo da essere anche più in linea con la ‘product governance’ prevista di Mifid II”, ha spiegato Foti.

Altra novità della banca multicanale del gruppo UniCredit è stata quella di adeguare le condizioni dei conti correnti aperti prima del 2012, che avevano una indicizzazione all‘Euribor a 1 mese (oggi negativo) portandoli a zero costi e zero interessi come gli altri. Questo vuol dire, si legge nella presentazione, che un incremento di 100 punti base dei tassi a breve si tradurrebbe in un aumento del margine di interesse di 132 milioni.

“Consente una migliore asset liability management”, ha detto Foti. “Se i tassi dovessero salire offriremo ai nostri clienti delle alternative a maggiore remunerazione a cui passare quasi automaticamente”, ha aggiunto, ricordando che i tassi di interesse sono destinati a restare negativi ancora a lungo e che se i tassi restano bassi altrettanto bassa resta la propensione dei clienti a vincolare la propria liquidità.

Commentando il dato di raccolta del mese di ottobre, che ha visto afflussi di 517 milioni, Foti ha detto infine che la banca si avvantaggia del trend di domanda di consulenza e della crescente digitalizzazione del paese “che sta procedendo a passi spediti e questo sta spostando l‘attenzione dei clienti dalla prossimità della filiale alla qualità del servizio”.

The search warrant executed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at MedCure Inc headquarters here on November 1 is sealed, and the bureau and the company declined to comment on the nature of the FBI investigation. But people familiar with the matter said the inquiry concerns the manner in which MedCure distributes body parts acquired from its donors.

MedCure is among the largest brokers of cadavers and body parts in the United States. From 2011 through 2015, documents obtained under public-record laws show, the company received more than 11,000 donated bodies and distributed more than 51,000 body parts to medical industry customers nationally. In a current brochure, the company says that 80,000 additional people have pledged to donate their bodies to MedCure when they die.

FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele confirmed the day-long search of the 25,000-square-foot facility, but declined to comment further because the matter is under seal. A person familiar with the matter said that FBI agents took records from MedCure but did not remove human remains.

The search warrant, though sealed, signals that an FBI investigation of MedCure has reached an advanced stage. To obtain a search warrant to seize records, rather than demand them via subpoena, FBI agents must provide a detailed affidavit to a U.S. magistrate with evidence to support probable cause that crimes have been committed and that related records may be on the premises.

“MedCure is fully cooperating with the FBI, and looks forward to resolving whatever questions the government may have about their business,” said Jeffrey Edelson, a Portland attorney who represents the company. “Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we do not believe that further comment is appropriate at this time.”

It is illegal to profit from the sale of organs destined for transplant, such as hearts and kidneys. But as a Reuters series detailed last month, it is legal in most U.S. states to sell donated whole bodies or their dissected parts, such as arms and heads, for medical research, training and education.

Commonly known as body brokers, these businesses often profit by targeting people too poor to afford a burial or cremation. Reuters documented how people who donate their bodies to science may be unwittingly contributing to commerce. Few states regulate the body donation industry, and those that do so have different rules, enforced with varying degrees of thoroughness. Body parts can be bought with ease in the United States. A Reuters reporter bought two heads and a spine from a Tennessee broker with just a few emails.

MedCure, founded in 2005, is based outside Portland, Oregon, and has offices in Nevada, Florida, Rhode Island and Missouri, as well as Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At some locations, including the one near Portland, MedCure provides training labs for doctors and health professionals to practice surgical techniques. MedCure also sends body parts and technicians to assist with medical conferences across the country.

MedCure is accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks, a national organization that primarily works with transplant tissue banks. The broker is also licensed by the state health departments in Oregon and New York, among the few states that conduct inspections. According to Oregon state health records, officials renewed MedCure’s license in January, following a routine on-site review.

Dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have already been held in the purge announced on Saturday. They face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain.

But the sources, speaking on Wednesday, said a number of other individuals suspected of wrongdoing were detained in an expansion of the crackdown, widely seen as an initiative of the powerful heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Others under scrutiny are being telephoned by investigators about their finances but appear to remain at liberty, one of the sources said, adding that the number of people targeted by the crackdown was expected eventually to rise into the hundreds.

The number of domestic bank accounts frozen as a result of the purge is over 1,700 and rising, up from 1,200 reported on Tuesday, banking sources said.

A number of those held most recently include individuals with links to the immediate family of the late Crown Prince and Defence Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz who died in 2011, the sources said.

STOCKS FALL

Others appear to be lower-level managers and officials, one of the sources said.

Many Saudis have cheered the purge as an attack on the theft of state funds by the rich, and U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years”.

But some Western officials expressed apprehension at the possible ramifications for the secretive tribal and royal politics of the world’s largest oil exporter.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market continued to fall in early trade on Wednesday because of concern about the economic impact of its anti-corruption purge. The Saudi index .TASI was 1.0 percent lower after half an hour of trade. Shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation slid further.

Late on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi central bank sought to ease worries about the crackdown.

They said that while individuals were being targeted and having their bank accounts frozen, national and multinational companies - including those wholly or partly owned by individuals under investigation - would not be disrupted.

Anti-corruption authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of the most senior members of the ruling Al Saud, and some of his immediate family members, the sources added.

Prince Mohammed, or MbN as he is known, was ousted as Crown Prince in June when King Salman replaced him with the then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Since Sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.

RIGHTS CONCERNS

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since his ousting at the funeral on Tuesday for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

Among business executives detained in the probe so far are billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE; Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar, founder of Al Tayyar Travel 1810.SE; and Amr al-Dabbagh, chairman of builder Red Sea International 4230.SE.

The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had urged Saudi Arabia to carry out any prosecution of officials detained in a “fair and transparent” manner.

Commenting on the purge, Human Rights Watch called on Saudi authorities to “immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person’s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights”.

“It’s great that Saudi authorities are declaring that they want to take on the scourge of corruption, but the right way to do that is through diligent judicial investigations against actual wrongdoing, not sensationalistic mass arrests to a luxury hotel,” Right Watch official Sarah Leah Whitson in a statement.",Saudi Arabia makes fresh arrests in anti-graft crackdown: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arrests-detentions/saudi-arabia-makes-fresh-arrests-in-anti-graft-crackdown-sources-idUKKBN1D81FL?il=0

With more than 75 percent of the city’s voting precincts reporting, de Blasio, 56, had won nearly 65 percent, a margin of 35 percentage points over his Republican opponent, state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, according to New York City’s Board of Elections.

The New York Times and other media called the race for de Blasio.

De Blasio, who held a comfortable lead in opinion polls leading up to Election Day, had been widely expected to cruise to victory in a city of 8.5 million people dominated by Democratic voters.

A progressive liberal, de Blasio in the past week campaigned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent. Sanders backed de Blasio’s call for a tax hike on city residents earning more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in Albany.

The mayor has positioned himself as one of the most vocal critics of Republican President Donald Trump, who has received strong disapproval ratings from voters in his native city.

Daisy Taberas, 71, who immigrated from Peru 48 years ago, said she voted for de Blasio because of her concerns over Trump’s stance on immigration.

“I like the way (de Blasio) works with children in the schools, and he’s trying to protect the city and he cares about immigration,” Taberas said after casting her ballot at a Manhattan polling site.

De Blasio has taken heat for problems in the city’s aging subway system, the largest in the United States. The mayor, who has faced complaints over rising disruptions and delays on the subway system, has emphasized that it is run by a state-controlled authority, not the city.

He has also been plagued by accusations of a pay-to-play culture within City Hall. A former donor, Jona Rechnitz, recently testified at the corruption trial of a union boss that he established a direct line to the de Blasio administration after raising money for the mayor’s election campaign in 2013.

After years of investigation, federal prosecutors said in March they would not charge de Blasio, a point he reiterated on the campaign trail.

The state-owned Middle Eastern carrier is buying nearly 10 percent of its struggling Hong Kong counterpart for about $661 million. That may not be a money-spinner for the Qataris, but it will certainly complicate any future manoeuvring over Cathay’s ownership.

The deal, unveiled on Monday, looks partly like a consolation prize. Qatar Airways recently had to drop a controversial attempt to buy a chunk of American Airlines. But the company is still following a trajectory similar to Abu Dhabi’s Etihad, gobbling up minority stakes left and right.

True, the airline is a more natural investor than the seller, Kingboard Chemical, a bargain-hunting group whose day job is making laminates, chemicals and circuit boards. And the duo, who are already partners in the Oneworld alliance, could reap some benefits from collaborating more closely: Corrine Png of Crucial Perspective says this could cover areas like cross-marketing and joint procurement.

Still, Etihad and others show the perils of airlines dabbling in portfolio-building. This can tie up funds in a capital-hungry industry, and the buyer gets little clout in return. Such deal-making also tends to concentrate on cheaper, more distressed carriers.

It is not clear if Qatar Airways will even get a board seat in this deal. And while the airline characterises this as a financial investment, it is unlikely to be lucrative, at least in the short term. Analysts expect Cathay to record a loss this year, and be barely profitable in 2018. A price of HK$13.65 a share equates to about 16 times estimated earnings in 2019: hardly a bargain.

On the other hand, the stake does give Qatar Airways a seat at the table if Cathay were to be put up for sale. It is 45 percent owned by Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong conglomerate, and 30 percent by mainland carrier Air China. Swire has remained committed despite Cathay’s recent difficulties. But should it decide to quit or sell down, it now has two suitors to play against each other, assuming national ownership hurdles can be overcome.",Breakingviews - Qatar Airways gets seat for any Cathay dealmaking,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cathay-pacific-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-qatar-airways-gets-seat-for-any-cathay-dealmaking-idUSKBN1D60CK

While Broad admitted he bowled “like a drain” in the warm-up match in Perth last weekend, he reckons it helped him adjust his length ahead of the series opener at the Gabba in Brisbane on Nov. 23.

The 31-year-old said his side will have to adapt their strategy appropriately, as they look to avoid a repeat of the 5-0 drubbing they received in the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia. England then won the next series on home soil in 2015.

“We have to look at what we do best as a group. We’re not going to blast the Australians out. We don’t have a Brett Lee-type bowler who can bowl 95mph reverse-swinging yorkers,” Broad told reporters in Adelaide.

”I like bowling in Australia because it encourages you to hit the pitch hard. If you get a bit of nibble either way you bring the stumps and the edge in.

“We have to adjust our lengths a bit. I tried to bowl a bit too full at the WACA and got belted so I’ve learned that lesson, and bowled that heavy length that gets wickets in Australia.”

Broad added that his fellow bowlers are looking for ways to strain the attacking instincts of the Australian batsmen, which could mean setting up slightly defensive fields.

He hopes to follow in the footsteps of former Australian bowler Glenn McGrath, who enjoyed success on the home soil by holding a tight length for long periods.

“I don’t know if playing on egos is the right way to say it, but if you can cut off a few of their boundaries then you have more chance of them making a mistake,” Broad added.

“Look at the likes of Glenn McGrath and Josh Hazlewood, who just run up and belt length more often than not. Not getting too full.”",England paceman Broad aims to hit the pitch hard to attack Australia,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-cricket-ashes-broad/england-paceman-broad-aims-to-hit-the-pitch-hard-to-attack-australia-idUKKBN1D825H

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.

Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the “Brexit discount” demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world’s fifth-largest economy.

But May’s loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.

After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.

For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year’s referendum.

“Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,” says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.

“If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.”

VICIOUS CYCLE

Markets now assume May’s failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government’s Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.

But there’s little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.

Anxiety that Britain’s economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.

Sterling’s weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England’s target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.

FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

But high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.

The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.

That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.

Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=

“The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,” said Josh O‘Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world’s single biggest currency trader, in London.

”We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.

“And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.”

Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.

“The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,” said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper. “The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.”

Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.

That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.

Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.

”But here’s the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,“ he said. ”The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.

“But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.”","Hard or soft Brexit aside, pound nervous of economic slowdown",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis/hard-or-soft-brexit-aside-pound-nervous-of-economic-slowdown-idUSKBN19528B

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

In addition to the new JV, Ford and Zotye will explore offering mobility services to consumers in China as local demand for such solutions continues to grow, Ford’s statement added.

China, struggling with alarming pollution levels in major cities, is aggressively pushing plug-in vehicles and has poured in tens of billions of yuan in investment, research funding and subsidies, drawing many new automakers to launch projects.","Ford, China's Zotye Auto invest $756 million in electric vehicle JV",https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1D81L4-OCATC

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down 58 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $63.69 a barrel, having climbed 3.5 percent on Monday.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $57.20 a barrel.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman moved to shore up his power base with the arrest of royals, ministers and investors, which an official described as part of “phase one” of a crackdown.

More tellingly, tensions escalated between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran, which analysts said did more to rattle the market than the prince’s purge.

“Saudi Arabia is really going all-in again against Iran and that is, for me, more the focus than the domestic issue,” Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.

“On the one hand, it increases the global geopolitical risk level, but it also increases the difficulty of keeping consensus within OPEC.”

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, has agreed to restrain crude output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) together with 10 other nations including Russia until March 2018.

OPEC meets at the end of this month and has been widely expected to extend the deal.

“That idea that the extension is going to be a done deal is still adding buoyancy in the market,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.

The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, OPEC’s Mohammad Barkindo told reporters on Tuesday, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.

Brazil has rejected an informal effort by Saudi Arabia to coax Latin America’s top oil producer into joining OPEC-led production cuts aimed at boosting prices that have been hit by oversupply, a Brazilian official said.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting against the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday that it was closing all Yemeni air, sea and land crossings after a missile was fired towards Riyadh at the weekend.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have said they see Iran as responsible for the Yemen conflict and on Monday Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said his country reserves the right to respond to Iran’s “hostile actions”.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast domestic crude oil production in 2018 to rise by more than previously expected.

In its monthly short-term energy outlook, the agency forecast that U.S. crude oil output will rise by 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.95 million bpd in 2018. Last month, it expected a 680,000 bpd year-over-year increase to 9.92 million bpd.

Market watchers were looking ahead to weekly energy data from the American Petroleum Institute at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT).

Apple Inc is expected to report a 1.3 percent increase in iPhone sales in the holiday quarter, its slowest ever and a far cry from the double-digit growth investors have come to expect. Apple sold 75.5 million iPhones in the October-December quarter, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount, 1 million more than what was sold in the year-ago quarter. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic - GF20000107877

The justices left in place a 2016 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that upheld a verdict that found South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had infringed Apple Inc’s patents on several popular features of the California-based company’s iPhone. Those included slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links.

The Supreme Court in December 2016 sided with Samsung in a separate case over its fight with Apple. In that one, the justices threw out a $399 million damages award against Samsung to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.

A judge in California in October ordered a new trial over damages in that case.

The current appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict by a jury in federal court in San Jose, California ordering Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages.

A three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, a Washington-based court that specializes in patent matters, had originally overturned the verdict, but it was reinstated in an October 2016 ruling by a full slate of 11 judges on that court.

Appealing to the Supreme Court, Samsung said that the patent court’s judges did not follow proper procedure in reviving the verdict because they made the decision without considering additional legal papers or hearing oral arguments. The judges also wrongly changed the law related to invalidating patents and awarding injunctions, Samsung added.

In a dig at the patent court, Samsung told the justices in legal papers that they have “long served as the bulwark when the Federal Circuit tips the balance too far in favor of patent-holders’ rights at the expense of innovation and competition.”

Apple urged the justices to leave the jury award in place, saying there was nothing “novel or important” to review in its rival’s appeal.

Trump will be in Manila on the last leg of his 12-day Asian trip, which includes visits to Japan, South Korea, China, and Vietnam.

Trump will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, make a state visit to Hanoi and end his trip with the Association of South East Asia Nations summit in Manila.

“You want to ask a question, I’ll give you an answer. Lay off. That is not your business. That is my business. I take care of my country and I will nurture my country to health,” Duterte told reporters before leaving for Vietnam.

More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defence after armed suspects resisted arrest in Duterte’s war on drugs. Critics dispute that and say executions are taking place with zero accountability, allegations the police reject.

Here are the most pressing commercial issues between the world’s two-biggest economies as Trump visits Beijing this week.

U.S. IP INVESTIGATION

Trump’s Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has launched a “Section 301” investigation into China’s alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property.

Rarely used in recent decades, the probe looks at claims China ignores patent and copyright protections, and forces U.S. companies to turn over technology or enter into joint ventures with Chinese partners. Any conclusion is likely months away, and would be challenged at the World Trade Organization by Beijing.

MARKET ECONOMY STATUS

Despite pledges to open up after China joined the WTO in 2001, Xi has consolidated government control over the economy. The United States uses standards for non-market economies to determine anti-dumping duties against Chinese companies, given the extent of the government’s control over price and output decisions.

The designation deeply angers Beijing, which argues that Washington is using an expired clause in China’s 2001 WTO accession deal in assessing whether China is dumping goods on the international market.

DISCRIMINATORY TECH POLICIES

New national security and cyber security regulations require companies to store crucial data within China and pass security reviews, which foreign tech firms say could put business secrets at risk.

U.S. companies also complain they face discriminatory Chinese industrial plans, such as the “Made in China 2025” initiative, which offers government backing to domestic companies in sectors the Chinese government deems strategic.

MARKET BARRIERS

Foreign companies are prohibited from investment and majority ownership in strategic sectors, including the automotive, securities, healthcare services, insurance and cloud computing industries. Chinese firms, however, can operate freely in these sectors in the United States.

China promised this year it would allow U.S. payment card companies to run fully-owned units in China, but they still face pressure to form local joint ventures.

Lawmakers in Congress aim to introduce legislation broadening the review powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), unnerved by Chinese efforts to acquire sensitive U.S. technology. Beijing complains CFIUS reviews are protectionist.

BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY

Talks on a bilateral investment treaty have sputtered. Washington wants China to cut a “negative list” of sectors where U.S. investment is prohibited, from financial services to telecommunications.

SOYBEANS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

Chinese commodity importers are expected to sign deals to buy more U.S. soybeans and other agricultural products, building on an agreement in May.

China is also expected to buy more U.S. beef, barley and dairy products, including cheese.

It would be the third such bilateral deal for agricultural products this year. China is the world’s top importer of soybeans and dropped a 14-year ban U.S. beef imports earlier this year.

GAS AND OIL

Protesters shut down roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, and some public transport ran minimum services in response to calls for action by two civic groups -- whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- and a labor union.

People stood across dozens of major highways in the region waving placards and chanting “freedom for political prisoners”, TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters.

While many smaller stores left their shutters closed, most larger shops and businesses in the region appeared to be open as normal.

An uphill task awaited the political heavyweights of the independence campaign, whose parties jointly ran Catalonia for the last two years until Madrid sacked the region’s government in response to its independence push.

Deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont’s center-right PDeCAT and the leftist ERC of former regional vice president Oriol Junqueras had until midnight on Tuesday to agree a new pact, but they failed to meet that deadline, meaning they will contest the Dec. 21 vote as separate parties.

The central government in Madrid called the election last month after assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament’s unilateral independence declaration.

Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, while Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds.

‘JUNCKER WON‘T MEET ME’

Puigdemont, who faces the same charges and is the subject of a extradition request from Madrid, had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union.

But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc’s executive.

“(EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn’t want to meet me,” Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard.

“I’ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now, are wrecking Europe ... The gap between the Europe of the people and the official Europe is increasing.”

Catalonia’s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, triggered a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the country’s civil war in the 1930s.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month’s election would usher in “a period of calm” and business as usual for the region.

“I‘m hoping for massive participation in the election.. and, after that, we’ll return to normality,” he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday.

An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras’ ERC could garner between 45 and 46 seats in Catalonia’s 135-strong regional assembly while Puigdemont’s PdeCat would win just 14 or 15.

In order to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority, they would then have to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP.

ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a banking conference in Madrid he hoped the election would revive the Catalan success story “during which it has enjoyed great economic and cultural prosperity together with a high level of self-governance.”

For some Catalans who ignored Wednesday’s strike -- called by the CSC union and supported by civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural -- that moment is already overdue.

“Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary. In this world we have to work and not argue so much,” Jose Luis, a construction worker, told Reuters TV as he walked through Barcelona on his way to work.

Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”

“Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit.

Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations.

Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.”

He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.”

The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

“The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region.

‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’

In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance.

While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures.

During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul.

He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed.

The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official.

Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added.

Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday.

Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said.

While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions.

‘GRAVE DANGER’

Slideshow (16 Images)

During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”

However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach.

North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving.

“North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.

He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader.

Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.”

The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said.

A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.

“The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One.

The case, in which a conservative Christian bakery owner seeks the right to discriminate against gay couples, is the latest attempt by conservatives to carve out special exemption for business owners to civil rights laws.

If the briefs filed by the petitioner and its most influential allies are any indication, the strategy will likely be to portray this case as a unique one that would warrant a very narrow constitutional exception. But don’t be fooled. If the state of Colorado’s application of its laws is found to be unconstitutional, it would unleash a widespread assault on civil rights protections.

In 2012, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, to arrange for a cake to be made for their wedding reception. They were told by Jack Phillips, the store’s owner, that he could not fulfill their order because his religious beliefs prevented him from preparing goods for same-sex wedding ceremonies (although he was otherwise willing to serve LBGT customers). Mullins and Craig sued Masterpiece under Colorado civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by “public accommodations” (businesses or other institutions that are regularly open to the public). Mullins and Craig won: the Colorado Civil Rights Division agreed that Masterpiece had illegally discriminated against them, and its decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals. Masterpiece appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.

It would be natural to assume that this case will be argued on the basis of freedom of religion protections in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has recently given companies broad freedom to ignore laws in deference to the owner’s religious faith. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court held that employers could reject requirements that taxpayer-subsidized employer-provided health insurance cover contraception if doing so would violate the religious beliefs. But while Masterpiece has raised religious freedom objections, the case is unlikely to turn on these grounds. Since the 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court has held that the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment is not violated when a religion-neutral law incidentally burdens an individual’s religious beliefs, as long as that law did not intentionally target religious minorities. Colorado’s application of civil rights law clearly did not violate the free exercise clause based on this precedent, so an argument solely on free religion grounds would be a certain loser.

The Hobby Lobby ruling was based not on the First Amendment but on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a statute passed in response to Employment Division. Since the 1997 Supreme Court ruling in City of Boerne v. Flores, however, RFRA does not apply to state governments. It would therefore be nearly impossible for Masterpiece to prevail on a religious freedom claim.

Backed up by a brief from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, Masterpiece will almost certainly focus on another part of the First Amendment: the free speech clause. The shop is arguing that, given the artistry involved in creating a custom wedding cake, compelling it to create a cake for a ceremony it morally disapproves of would violate its rights to freedom of speech and expression.

Creating religious exceptions to generally applicable laws would make civil rights statutes very difficult to enforce, since discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation can all be defended on religious grounds. If applied logically, a religious exemption would quickly mean that civil rights laws exist only at the pleasure of the employer.

Recognizing this liability in a free expression argument, Masterpiece will likely claim that a free expression exemption applies only in the very narrow context of a mom-and-pop bakery being asked to make something for a particular ceremony. Most employees of most companies, they will argue, are not engaged in activity that is similarly expressive.

But as the libertarian legal scholars Dale Carpenter and Eugene Volokh argue in their persuasive amicus brief on behalf of Colorado, if Masterpiece’s free speech claim were accepted by the Court, it would “apply to a vast range of conduct.” Many of the activities employees and their supervisors engage in on the job have elements as potentially “expressive” as baking a cake, and this is true of both tiny storefronts and Fortune 500 corporations. “[Restaurant chain] Subway calls its sandwich-makers ‘sandwich artists,’” Carpenter and Volokh observe, “[b]ut a restaurant may not refuse to cook or prepare a table for certain customers on the ground that it would be a free speech compulsion.” Similarly, a florist who didn’t want to participate in a same-sex wedding could declare themselves “floral artists,” hotel receptionists could declare themselves “phone answering artists,” and so on.

It is unclear about where the line would end up being drawn should the Court accept Masterpiece’s free speech argument. But even if it ended up being fairly narrow, it would still require extensive litigation to find out. And it’s likely that in practice the exceptions would not be narrow at all. The wise approach for the Supreme Court would be to follow the lead of the Colorado court and uphold the sound judgement of the state’s civil rights commission: that while Jack Phillips is entitled to his beliefs, when he opens a business to the public he is required to follow state laws and treat his customers equally.

In a statement on Monday, the Security Council had urged Myanmar to “ensure no further excessive use of military force” and expressed “grave concern over reports of human rights violations and abuses in Rakhine State”.

Responding, Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military, said the issues facing Myanmar and Bangladesh could only be resolved bilaterally, a point she says was ignored in the Security Council statement.

“Furthermore, the (Security Council) Presidential Statement could potentially and seriously harm the bilateral negotiations between the two countries which have been proceeding smoothly and expeditiously,” Suu Kyi’s office said in a statement.

In contrast, Bangladesh issued a statement saying Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali “appreciated the recent statement of the U.N. Security Council” during a meeting with a new resident coordinator of the United Nations in Bangladesh.

The Myanmar statement said Ali had been invited to Myanmar on Nov. 16 and Nov. 17, but Bangladeshi officials told Reuters that the earliest the talks were likely to take place was during the minister’s visit for a regional meeting in the Myanmar capital of Naypyidaw on Nov. 20 and Nov. 21.

The two sides have to agree a process for repatriation of Rohingya, with Bangladesh reluctant to fall back on the drill used for the return of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar in the 1990s, as it wants a more lasting solution.

A senior Bangladesh foreign ministry official said the United Nations should be involved in the process this time.

“For years, we tried to resolve this issue bilaterally with Myanmar, but it was in vain,” the official told Reuters. “This problem is not going to be resolved anytime soon. The UN’s involvement in the process is a must.”

A sour note was struck over the talks last week, as Bangladesh officials voiced outrage over Suu Kyi’s spokesman casting suspicion that Bangladesh might drag its feet over the repatriation process in order to first secure hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid money.

Speaking at a conference for Commonwealth countries’ parliamentarians in Dhaka on Sunday, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for more international pressure on Myanmar.

“I would request all of you to discuss Rohingya issue with utmost priority and exert pressure on the Myanmar government to stop the persecution of its citizens and take them back at the earliest,” she said.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to visit Myanmar on Nov. 15, with moves afoot in Washington to table a bill calling for sanctions on Myanmar that specifically target the military and related business interests.

In a nod to China, the Myanmar statement said it appreciated the stand taken by some members of the Security Council who upheld the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries.

To appease council veto powers Russia and China, Britain and France dropped a push for the Security Council to adopt a resolution on the situation and the 15-member body instead unanimously agreed on a formal statement.

The United Nations has denounced the violence during the past 10 weeks as a classic example of ethnic cleansing to drive the Rohingya Muslims out of Buddhist majority Myanmar.

Rejecting that accusation, the military says its counter-insurgency clearance operation was provoked by Rohingya militants’ synchronized attacks on 30 security posts in the northern part of Rakhine State on Aug. 25.

Rohingya refugees say the military torched their villages, but the military say the arsonists were Rohingya militants. The refugees’ have given harrowing accounts of rape and murder. Myanmar says those accusations will have to be investigated.

Meantime, the exodus from Rakhine continues. Several thousand Rohingya reached Bangladesh last week, many wading through shallows on the Naf river on the boundary between the two countries, and some making a short, but perilous sea crossing in small boats.

On Wednesday, 52 Rohingya came ashore in Bangladesh on a raft lashed together from bamboo and plastic jerrycans, having been unable to find a boat to take them, Shariful Islam, a Bangladesh border guard official, told Reuters.

On Tuesday, border guards told Reuters of at least two other boats with 68 Rohingya reaching Cox’s Bazar, where they would join the multitude sheltering in refugee camps.

Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who defied the junta that ruled Myanmar for decades, has been pilloried abroad for not speaking out more forcefully to rein in the military.

Last week she visited Rakhine for the first time since the crisis erupted, meeting community leaders and seeing the efforts to deliver aid and return the region to some semblance of normality.

She has spoken of plans for repatriation centers at which refugees will have to prove they once lived in Rakhine, before being allowed to return. But having been classed as stateless by former junta rulers, Rohingya could struggle to pass the test.",Myanmar warns U.N. scolding could harm talks with Bangladesh on Rohingya crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-rohingya/myanmar-warns-u-n-scolding-could-harm-talks-with-bangladesh-on-rohingya-crisis-idUKKBN1D809R

That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science and invent new technologies.

The most innovative university in the region, for the second year running, is South Korea’s KAIST. Formerly known as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, it is the nation’s oldest research-oriented science and engineering university, with campuses in Daejeon, Seoul and Busan.

KAIST earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than 74 out of the 75 top-ranked universities in the region, and outside researchers frequently cite KAIST inventions in their own patents and research papers. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Asia Pacific’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

Recent KAIST research highlights include the development of a “parasite” robot that controls the movements of a living host: The device is mounted onto the shell of a turtle, and uses a combination of flashing lights and food rewards to direct the animal. The research could lead to hybrid animal-robot systems that would allow access to environments that would otherwise be difficult to reach on their own. In 2015 a university team collaborated with Rainbow Co, a company spun out of KAIST’s Humanoid Robot Research Center, to win the U.S. Department of Defense’s DARPA Robotics Challenge with an adaptable humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO.

The second most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region is also based in South Korea. Seoul National University was founded in 1946 as the country’s first national university, and now operates 16 colleges, one graduate school and 10 professional schools. In 2016 SNU received more than KRW 76 billion (about $68 million) in research funding from external industry, approximately 15 percent of its total funding.

South Korean universities typically have close relationships with industry. Fourth-place Pohang University of Science & Technology, or POSTECH, was actually founded by the South Korean steel company POSCO in 1986, and its 400-acre campus is located only a few minutes away from POSCO headquarters. POSTECH ranks first among all universities on the list in terms of the percentage of research articles it produces that include a co-author from industry, and the number of times its research papers are cited by articles originating in the private sector.

Overall, South Korean universities fill four of the top five spots on the ranking and eight of the top 20. There are 22 South Korean universities among the top 75, far more than you’d expect from a relatively small nation. Korea’s population is just under 51 million, so that’s one top-ranked university per 2.3 million people. In contrast, China has the most universities on the list – 25 between Hong Kong and the mainland – but it also has a massive population of more than 1.37 billion people, or one top-ranked university per 54.9 million people. (Japan has 19 ranked universities, Australia has five, Singapore has two, and New Zealand and India each have one.)

Some nations underperform on the ranking because of the way they organize their university systems. Despite boasting the world’s second-largest population (more than 1.26 billion) and one of its largest economies, only one Indian university appears in the top 75, The Indian Institutes of Technology (#71). IIT is a network of 23 universities which centralizes its patent administration, so it's not always possible to identify which constituent university was responsible for what research. As a result, Reuters ranked the entire system as opposed to individual universities. World-class campuses like IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay may have ranked much higher on the list if they weren’t grouped in with smaller and newer institutes like IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad.

And some countries are missing from the list entirely. There are no ranked universities in Indonesia, which contains Asia’s third largest population. Nor are there any universities in Pakistan or Bangladesh, the region’s fourth- and fifth-most populous countries, or any universities in the Philippines and Vietnam, two of the region’s largest economies.

To compile the 2017 ranking of the Asia Pacific region’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included universities in East Asia, South Asia, and Oceania, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Asia’s Most Innovative Universities. Five universities that ranked in the top 75 last year slipped off the list in 2017: Japan’s Nihon University, the Indian Institute of Science – Bangalore, Putra University Malaysia, the University of South Australia, and Malaysia’s University of Malaya. These drop offs were all supplanted by fast-growing institutions in China and South Korea: the China University of Petroleum (#45), the University of Ulsan (#69), the University of Electronic Science & Technology of China (#70), Yeungnam University (#73), and Tongji University (#75).

The returning university that made the biggest move on the list was the University of Hong Kong, which climbed 26 spots from #56 to #30. That change is largely attributable to adjustments in Clarivate Analytics’ methodology: The university’s 2016 ranking did not account for patents that originated at HKU but were assigned to its commercialization arm, Versitech Limited, and the addition of those patents improves the university’s overall performance. Other big movers include China’s Huazhong University of Science & Technology (up 24 spots to #33) and the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (up 13 spots to #34). Japan's Okayama University (down 14 spots to #52) and Waseda University (down 18 to #66) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Overall, the ranking remained largely stable year over year, with eight of 2016’s top 10 universities returning to the top 10, and 18 of the top 20.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of the scope of its researchers’ work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 75 in the region: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

O desprendimento, segundo a fonte citada pela revista, gerou rápido deslocamento do centro de gravidade do avião, que “girou no próprio eixo enquanto perdia altura”.

“Os pilotos conseguiram recuperar a aeronave a pouco mais de 1.000 pés em relação ao terreno, o que significa cerca de 300 metros”, escreveu a revista, que citou que o protótipo sofreu danos estruturais.

Stronger pay growth would ease a big problem for Britain’s economy -- wages lagging inflation -- and could add to the case for further interest rates hikes by the Bank of England, which last week raised rates for the first time since 2007.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said its monthly survey showed starting salaries rose in October at the second-quickest rate since November 2015.

“We already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,” REC chief executive Kevin Green said.

“We therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.”

Separately on Wednesday, the Bank of England said recruitment difficulties had intensified and were above normal in a range of activities.

The BoE report, based on the findings of its regional agents across the country, said companies expected pay settlements next year to offer increases of around 2.5–3.5 percent rather than the 2–3 percent range seen during 2017.

Last week, the BoE predicted overall pay growth of around 3 percent next year, up from just over 2 percent this year.

Britain’s official statistics agency said in August that net migration fell to its lowest level in three years with more than half the drop caused by European Union citizens leaving and fewer arriving since the Brexit vote.

REC said its survey, conducted with data firm IHS Markit, showed the availability of permanent and temporary workers continued to fall sharply last month.

Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in 10 years, in part because it expects the plunge in unemployment in Britain will soon start to push up wages.

The BoE also thinks slower growth in investment by businesses ahead of Brexit will aggravate a problem already facing Britain’s economy: that it cannot grow as fast as before without generating extra inflation pressure.

In its regional agents report, the BoE said business investment would continue to grow at a modest pace over the next year before weaker increases over the following two years.

“Economic uncertainty was the biggest drag on investment plans,” the BoE said on Wednesday, citing a survey of 375 firms.

“Expectations about future trading arrangements and other factors related to the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, such as concerns around the future availability of overseas labor, were also reported to be restraining investment,” it said.",UK firms to offer higher pay as Brexit deters EU workers,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy-jobs/uk-firms-to-offer-higher-pay-as-brexit-deters-eu-workers-idUKKBN1D8045

And in this case, it’s working hard to stay on regulators’ good side.

Uber said it was the first formal services contract by the U.S. National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) covering low-altitude airspace rather than outer space. NASA has used such contracts to develop rockets since the late 1950s.

Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden also said Uber would begin testing four-passenger, 200-miles-per-hour (322-km-per-hour) flying taxi services across Los Angeles in 2020, its second test market after Dallas/Fort Worth.

Holden is set to reveal the company’s latest air taxi plans at Web Summit, an annual internet conference taking place in Lisbon this week.

“There is a reality that Uber has grown up a lot as a company,” Holden said in an interview ahead of his speech. “We are now a major company on the world stage and you can’t do things the same way where you are a large-scale, global company that you can do when you are a small, scrappy startup.”

Uber has faced endless regulatory and legal battles around the world since it launched its ride-hailing services earlier this decade, including a recent showdown in London, where it is battling to retain its license after having been stripped of it by city regulators over safety concerns. [nL8N1MO228]

The company is looking to speed development of a new industry of electric, on-demand, urban air taxis, Holden said, which customers could order up via smartphone in ways that parallel the ground-based taxi alternatives it has popularized while expanding into more than 600 cites since 2011.

The company plans to introduce paid, intra-city flying taxi services from 2023 and is working closely with aviation regulators in the United States and Europe to win regulatory approvals toward that end, a senior Uber executive told Reuters.

“We are very much embracing the regulatory bodies and starting very early in discussions about this and getting everyone aligned with the vision,” he said of Uber’s plans to introduce what he called “ride-sharing in the sky”.

Earlier this year, Uber hired NASA veterans Mark Moore and Tom Prevot to run, respectively, its aircraft vehicle design team and its air traffic management software program.

During a 32-year career at NASA, Moore pioneered its electric jet propulsion project which Uber considers to be the core technology for making urban air transportation possible.

MAKING TAXIS FLY

The contract with NASA is to solve the problem of operating hundreds or thousands of aircraft over urban areas with the goal of enabling uberAIR services to operate alongside existing air traffic control systems and in and around busy airports.

NASA was not immediately available to comment on the deal. Earlier this month it said it was working with a variety of companies, large and small, to develop the emerging market for what it terms Urban Air Mobility, or UAM.

Uber envisions a fleet of electric jet-powered vehicles - part helicopter, part drone and part fixed-wing aircraft - running multiple small rotors capable of both vertical take off and landing and rapid horizontal flight.

Two larger rotors used to lift the plane transition during flight into forward-thrusting propellers in newly released designs.

It plans to build no aircraft itself.

Instead, Uber is building the software to manage networks in the sky of flying taxis, while relying on a stable of manufacturers, including Aurora Flight Sciences, which was acquired by Boeing (BA.N) last month.

Uber has also signed up Embraer (EMBR3.SA), Mooney, Bell Helicopter - a unit of Textron (TXT.N) -, and Pipistrel Aircraft to build new vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.

It is also working with real estate developers Sandstone Properties in Los Angeles to build rooftop landing pads on skyscrapers from which it aims to offer its uberAIR services. It plans to start offering services from locations near a downtown sports arena, the international airport, Santa Monica and Sherman Oaks in suburban San Fernando Valley, the company said.",NASA contracts Uber to build flying taxi air control software,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-portugal-websummit-uber/nasa-contracts-uber-to-build-flying-taxi-air-control-software-idUSKBN1D81AE

U.S. Treasury yields edged higher but the yield curve remained close to its flattest level in a decade, potentially cutting into the profits of banks.

Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow while Bank of America weighed on the S&P. The S&P financial sector led the decliners, falling 0.7 percent.

Analysts said a flattening yield curve at a time when the Federal Reserve is hiking rates is a sign that investors are wary about the sustainability of economic growth and inflation in the world’s biggest economy.

Investors are also nervous about the potential outcome of a Republican plan to cut corporate taxes, unveiled last week. As well as slashing the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the bill would eliminate many tax breaks and is expected to face opposition from interest groups.

Senate Republican leaders are considering a one-year delay in the implementation of a major corporate tax cut to comply with Senate rules, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources.

“I do expect the tax bill to be watered down,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James.

“My concern is that the market has fully factored in that a tax bill is going to come to pass and this is still a very difficult road to get this done and there’s not a whole lot of time.”

Republicans are yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

The S&P has risen about 21 percent since the election of President Donald Trump, partly on the back of his promises to cut taxes and other business-friendly measures.

Statements of support from EU ambassadors to Lebanon and the United States have set a different tone to their Sunni Gulf ally Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon together with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah as parties hostile to it.

Lebanon has been pitched into deep crisis since the Saudi-allied Saad al-Hariri resigned on Saturday in a speech delivered from Saudi Arabia in which he accused Hezbollah and Iran of sowing strife in the Arab world and cited fear of assassination.

The circumstances surrounding Hariri’s sudden resignation have given rise to wide speculation that he had been caught up in a high-level anti-corruption purge in Saudi Arabia, where his family made their fortune, and coerced into resigning.

Saudi Arabia has denied this along with reports that it has put Hariri under house arrest. It says he quit because Hezbollah was calling the shots in the government.

The move has pulled Lebanon back to the forefront of a regional struggle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Shi‘ite Islamist government of Iran, a rivalry which has also swept through Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen.

It has plunged Lebanon into political crisis and hit market confidence in the heavily indebted Lebanese state. A sell off of Lebanese bonds continued for a third day on Wednesday, with some of them hitting their lowest ever levels.

The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon said on Wednesday the United States remained “committed to a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous Lebanon” during a meeting with Lebanese army commander General Joseph Aoun, a U.S. embassy statement said.

The meeting was to announce a U.S. government reimbursement of $42.9 million for border operations conducted by the Lebanese army, a major recipient of U.S. military aid.

The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group even as it supports the weak Lebanese state, drawing a line between the two in a long-standing policy.

On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said Lebanon was a strong U.S. partner. “The United States strongly supports the legitimate institutions in the Lebanese state,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

“We expect all members of the international community to respect fully those institutions and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon,” she said.

In a statement, EU ambassadors to Lebanon said they reaffirmed “their strong support for the continued unity, stability, sovereignty, and security of Lebanon and its people”.

SYRIAN REFUGEES

Lebanon has also received significant Western aid to help it cope with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, equivalent to around a quarter of the population.

Hezbollah, set up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is the most powerful group in Lebanon, with major sway in government and a guerrilla army that outguns the national military.

The group’s role has grown beyond Lebanon in recent years, and its fighters have provided critical support to President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.

Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government have responded to accusations made by Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the kingdom.

President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally who took office last year, has refused to accept Hariri’s resignation, saying he first wants him to return to Lebanon so he can meet him in person to understand the reasons.

Aoun said Lebanon’s security and economy were stable and the presidency still viewed Hariri as prime minister, Lebanese media reported. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has said the coalition government led by Hariri still stands.

NEW PM NOT SEEN LIKELY IN SHORT TERM

Lebanese policymakers and bankers say there is no concern for the Lebanese pound - which has been pegged against the U.S. dollar at the same rate for two decades - thanks to record levels of foreign currency reserves.

Banking sources say there was more demand than usual for converting Lebanese pound savings into dollars when banks opened on Monday. But they said this was not unexpected and is at minimal levels.

Lebanon’s June 2020 bond, and its April 2020 issue both fell to their lowest ever levels on Wednesday.

“Yields could come down, if a new Prime Minister is found quickly and the government can get back to business, but this doesn’t appear to be likely in the short term,” said Carmen Altenkirch, emerging market sovereign analyst at Axa Investment Managers.

Byblos Bank’s Chief Economist Nassib Ghobril said: “We’ve had worse cases when we saw pressure on the actual peg of Lebanese pound to U.S. dollar but it takes a severe shock of the magnitude of the (former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri) assassination in 2005 or the 2006 Israeli war to put real pressure on the currency peg.”","EU, U.S. affirm Lebanon support, diverging from Saudi",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-crisis/eu-u-s-affirm-lebanon-support-diverging-from-saudi-idUSKBN1D811H?il=0

I'm at a warehouse in New York City where what looks an unassuming collection of bags actually holds guitars belonging to some of the greatest musicians of all time.

Madonna, Tom Petty and Jimi Hendrix all played these guitars which will go under the hammer on December 2nd. This black Les Paul, the first guitar Madonna played live on stage estimated to go for 100,000 to $200,000 dollars and for this decal covered guitar played by Jimi Hendrix at a jam session in 1968.

Knapp 4000 deutsche Soldaten sind derzeit in 13 Missionen in Afrika, Asien, dem Nahen Osten und dem Kosovo stationiert - und die Grünen haben etwa der Hälfte der Einsätze nicht zugestimmt. Eine Bundestagsmehrheit wäre für die meisten Mandate dank der SPD-Stimmen zwar wohl auch in Zukunft gesichert. Ein Jamaika-Bündnis dürfte allerdings den Anspruch haben, auch in der Verteidigungspolitik allein handlungsfähig zu sein. Dazu würde gehören, die Militäreinsätze mit Regierungsmehrheit beschließen zu können.

Union, FDP und Grüne ringen nun darum, das Dilemma zu lösen. Klar scheint schon jetzt, dass der ein oder andere Einsatz unter einer Jamaika-Regierung verändert oder gar ganz beendet werden könnte.

Es folgt eine Liste der umstrittenen Missionen:

AUSBILDUNG DER PESCHMERGA IM NORDIRAK

Knapp 150 Bundeswehr-Soldaten bringen kurdischen Peschmerga im Norden des Irak seit Anfang 2015 den Umgang mit Waffen, militärische Taktik und Erste Hilfe für den Kampf gegen die Extremistenmiliz IS bei. Inzwischen ist der IS recht weit zurückgedrängt, stattdessen rücken Kämpfe zwischen den Volksgruppen im Irak in den Vordergrund. Die Bundeswehr sei aber nicht dazu da, in Unabhängigkeitsstreitigkeiten innerhalb des Landes Partei zu ergreifen, kritisierte der Grünen-Außenexperte Omid Nouripour im “Tagesspiegel”. Auch in der Union stellt sich angesichts der veränderten Lage mancher die Frage nach einer Ausstiegs-Strategie.

EINSATZ VON AUFKLÄRUNGSJETS GEGEN DEN IS

Deutsche Tornado-Jets starten vom jordanischen Stützpunkt al-Asrak zu Aufklärungsflügen über Syrien und dem Irak und tragen damit zum Kampf gegen den IS bei. Rund 270 deutsche Soldaten sind an der Mission beteiligt. Die Grünen lehnen den Einsatz ab, weil er kein UN-Mandat als Grundlage hat und sie befürchten, dass die Türkei die deutschen Aufklärungsbilder für ihren Kampf gegen die Kurden einsetzen könnte.

AFGHANISTAN

Noch knapp 1000 deutsche Soldaten sind am Hindukusch stationiert und helfen bei der Ausbildung und Beratung der afghanischen Sicherheitskräfte. Seit dem weitgehenden Abzug der Nato-Kampftruppen 2014 hat sich die Sicherheitslage in dem Land massiv verschlechtert. Bei den Grünen ist der seit inzwischen 15 Jahren laufende Einsatz hoch umstritten. Ein Kompromiss könnte sich vielleicht finden lassen, indem Deutschland künftig sein ziviles Engagement für das Land noch verstärkt.

EINSATZ GEGEN PIRATEN AM HORN VON AFRIKA

Die Mission soll dazu dienen, die Seehandelsroute am Horn von Afrika - eine der wichtigsten weltweit - zu sichern. Früher trugen die Grünen die EU-Mission mit, seit einigen Jahren enthalten sie sich jedoch, weil ein Beschluss auf EU-Ebene die Verfolgung von Piraten auch an Land gestattet. “Wenn Deutschland einen nationalen Vorbehalt anmelden und erklären würde, dass keine deutschen Soldaten an Land geschickt werden, könnten wir problemlos zustimmen”, sagte Nouripour dem “Tagesspiegel”.

OPERATION SOPHIA

Die Marine hat gut 200 Soldaten im Einsatz, um Schleuser zu stoppen und Flüchtlinge und Migranten im Mittelmeer vor der libyschen Küste aus Seenot zu retten. Die Grünen lehnen die europäische Mission als Militarisierung der Flüchtlingshilfe ebenso ab wie die ebenfalls in dem Mandat enthaltene Ausbildung der libyschen Küstenwache.

EU-AUSBILDUNGSEINSATZ FÜR SOMALIA

Weniger als ein Dutzend deutscher Soldaten hilft aktuell bei der Ausbildung somalischer Sicherheitskräfte. Die Grünen halten diesen Einsatz grundsätzlich zwar für sinnvoll, kritisieren aber, dass die Soldaten danach in Somalia nicht bezahlt werden. Damit bilde man nur künftige Piraten und Milizionäre aus.

Thick smog swathed Delhi, where pollution readings in some places peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government’s air quality index that measures poisonous particles.

“The air quality in Delhi is deteriorating. We cannot compromise with the health of children at this stage,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, ordering the closure until Sunday.

The Delhi administration, which described the city as a “gas chamber”, had previously ordered schools for young children to close only for Wednesday.

India’s federal health ministry also advised people with breathing problems and children to remain indoors.

“People should avoid morning walk or any other strenuous outdoor activity that increases breathing rate,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

Anti-pollution measures adopted by the Delhi state government in recent years include limiting car use and taxing trucks that pass through the city, but few have succeeded.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s federal government also urged Delhi and the surrounding northern states to immediately tackle dangerous levels of pollution in the capital, even if that meant deploying helicopters to spray jets of water.

“Every possible step required to tackle the situation has been already identified, and the need of the hour is to put them into action,” federal Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan wrote on social network Twitter, using the hashtag “#DelhiSmog”.

Vardhan also urged the surrounding states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to ban burning on farms, which is seen as a major contributor to the dirty air, along with high vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites.

EMERGENCY MEASURES

The Delhi government said it had sought meetings with state ministers to discuss the burning, provoking protest from many who saw the measure as being too little and too late.

“Nobody seems to get the gravity of the problem,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, the chairman and managing director of the Medanta Heart Institute.

Last November, the city’s worst pollution in nearly 20 years forced about a million children to miss school, while thousands of workers reported sick and people queued to buy face masks.

Residents are worried this year as well. The Indian Medical Association has urged organizers to call off Delhi’s biggest race set for Nov. 19, to protect runners and volunteers.

If pollution increases, emergency measures, such as the suspension of construction activity, will kick in, the Delhi government has said.

Long-term measures, such as improving public transport and banning the use of dirty industry fuel, are required, said Anumita Roychowdhury of New Delhi’s Centre for Science and Environment.

“Without the systemic changes, the scope and impact of the emergency measures will be limited,” she added.

The thick blanket of smog caused a major vehicle pile-up on a busy highway on the outskirts of Delhi, Indian media reported.

High pollution levels were driving a major surge for air purifiers in capital New Delhi and its suburbs, Amazon.com Inc’s India unit said.

Air purifier sales have surged 150 percent, along with a 260 percent increase in demand for face masks this year, Amazon said, adding that air purifier sales have risen 600 percent in the last month.","Delhi schools shut for rest of week as toxic smog thickens, chokes",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-india-pollution/delhi-schools-shut-for-rest-of-week-as-toxic-smog-thickens-chokes-idUKKBN1D810G?il=0

The wax figure of May, stepping out of Number 10 Downing Street in a red power suit and leopardskin kitten-heeled shoes, was unveiled by Madame Tussauds, a waxworks museum that is one of London’s top tourist attractions.

The real May, meanwhile, was battling multiple crises at once, with several of her cabinet ministers embroiled in scandals, open strife in her party over how to deliver Brexit and persistent debate about her suitability for the job.

“Whilst her policies may be questioned we can guarantee our wax figure of the prime minister is most definitely strong and stable,” said Edward Fuller, general manager of Madame Tussauds, poking fun at an election campaign slogan that backfired on May.

Presenting herself as pillar of “strong and stable leadership”, May called a snap election in June expecting to win by a hefty margin, but her campaign failed to inspire the voters and she instead lost her parliamentary majority.

Since then, her divided government has lurched from one crisis to another, with May’s humiliation culminating in a speech at her party conference during which a prankster joined her on stage and letters fell off a slogan behind her.

Slideshow (7 Images)

There was none of that sense of chaos and drift in the scene presented by Madame Tussauds, which shows a smiling May holding a smart black folder and stepping forward from the famous black door of her Downing Street office.

The red suit worn by the wax figure is the same as the one donned by May for a visit to the White House during which she held hands with U.S. President Donald Trump -- one of the most widely published images of her term as prime minister.

The real May also wore the red suit on election night in June, an unhappy occasion that saw her appear on stage to acknowledge victory in her local electoral district even as the scale of the debacle on the national scale was becoming clear.

Obviously, there are many areas of disagreement here. The United States would like China to do a lot more to reign in North Korea.

Several other big cities will select mayors and conservative Utah will hold a special election to replace U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who stepped down before his term ended. But the marquee contest is in Virginia, where polls show Democrat Ralph Northam has a slight edge over Republican Ed Gillespie in a nasty governor's race that will offer clues about the country's political mood. Gillespie, a Washington lobbyist and former Republican National Committee chairman, has kept his distance from Trump but embraced the president's combative campaign style with hard-edged ads hitting Northam on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. The ads put Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, on the defensive and helped Gillespie gain ground in opinion polls in recent weeks in Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 5 percentage points last year. A Gillespie win would be the latest in a series of setbacks for Democrats, who suffered losses in four contested congressional special elections earlier this year despite grassroots liberal enthusiasm for resisting Trump. Democrats fear it would also give Republicans a green light to exploit similar divisive cultural issues across the country next year, when all 435 House seats and 33 of the Senate's 100 seats will be up for election.

The company’s shares fell 4.5 percent to $14.05 in early trading on Wednesday.

U.S. restaurants have been dealing with a slide in grocery prices that is encouraging more consumers to prepare meals at home or use meal-kit delivery services such as Blue Apron (APRN.N), HelloFresh and Plated.

This has intensified competition among burger chains, with Wendy‘s, McDonald’s (MCD.N) and Burger King (QSR.TO) offering deeply discounted meals to get more customers to visit their outlets.

Traffic in August and September fell nearly 2.4 percent across the restaurant industry, Jefferies analysts said, compounded by the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey in the U.S. southeast.

Even after excluding the hurricanes, trends in the U.S. restaurants sector remain at “very soft levels”, the analysts added.

Wendy’s same-restaurant sales in North America rose 2 percent in the third quarter, lower than the 2.4 percent increase, analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected.

The burger chain, which has the highest concentration of stores in Florida and Texas among U.S. states, blamed hurricanes Irma and Harvey denting same-store sales in North America by 30 to 40 basis points.

The company also trimmed the higher end of its North American comparable-store sales forecast for the year to 2 percent to 2.5 percent from its previous range of 2 percent to 3 percent.

To counter fluctuating commodity and labor cost pressures, Wendy’s has been on a multi-year push to reduce the number of company-owned restaurants by selling them to franchises.

The company said it sold 249 restaurants to franchisees in the quarter, resulting in a 15.4 percent drop in sales to $308 million. Analysts had expected $311.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Excluding some items, the company earned 9 cents per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of 12 cents per share.

The Dublin, Ohio-based company also cut its adjusted profit forecast to 43 cents to 45 cents per share for full-year, from 45-47 cents it estimated earlier.","Stiff competition, hurricanes dampen Wendy's results, forecast",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wendys-results/stiff-competition-hurricanes-dampen-wendys-results-forecast-idUSKBN1D81NI?il=0

Dozens of royal family members, officials and business executives have already been held in the purge announced on Saturday. They face allegations of money laundering, bribery, extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain.

But the sources, speaking on Wednesday, said a number of other individuals suspected of wrongdoing were detained in an expansion of the crackdown, widely seen as an initiative of the powerful heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Others under scrutiny are being telephoned by investigators about their finances but appear to remain at liberty, one of the sources said, adding that the number of people targeted by the crackdown was expected eventually to rise into the hundreds.

The number of domestic bank accounts frozen as a result of the purge is over 1,700 and rising, up from 1,200 reported on Tuesday, banking sources said.

A number of those held most recently include individuals with links to the immediate family of the late Crown Prince and Defence Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz who died in 2011, the sources said.

STOCKS FALL

Others appear to be lower-level managers and officials, one of the sources said.

Many Saudis have cheered the purge as an attack on the theft of state funds by the rich, and U.S. President Donald Trump said those arrested had been “‘milking’ their country for years”.

But some Western officials expressed apprehension at the possible ramifications for the secretive tribal and royal politics of the world’s largest oil exporter.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market continued to fall in early trade on Wednesday because of concern about the economic impact of its anti-corruption purge. The Saudi index .TASI was 1.0 percent lower after half an hour of trade. Shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation slid further.

Late on Tuesday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi central bank sought to ease worries about the crackdown.

They said that while individuals were being targeted and having their bank accounts frozen, national and multinational companies - including those wholly or partly owned by individuals under investigation - would not be disrupted.

Anti-corruption authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of the most senior members of the ruling Al Saud, and some of his immediate family members, the sources added.

Prince Mohammed, or MbN as he is known, was ousted as Crown Prince in June when King Salman replaced him with the then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Since Sunday, the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis, one regional banker said, declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.

RIGHTS CONCERNS

MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since his ousting at the funeral on Tuesday for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash.

Among business executives detained in the probe so far are billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of investment firm Kingdom Holding 4280.SE; Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar, founder of Al Tayyar Travel 1810.SE; and Amr al-Dabbagh, chairman of builder Red Sea International 4230.SE.

The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had urged Saudi Arabia to carry out any prosecution of officials detained in a “fair and transparent” manner.

Commenting on the purge, Human Rights Watch called on Saudi authorities to “immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person’s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights”.

“It’s great that Saudi authorities are declaring that they want to take on the scourge of corruption, but the right way to do that is through diligent judicial investigations against actual wrongdoing, not sensationalistic mass arrests to a luxury hotel,” Right Watch official Sarah Leah Whitson in a statement.",Saudi Arabia makes fresh arrests in anti-graft crackdown: sources,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-detentions/saudi-arabia-makes-fresh-arrests-in-anti-graft-crackdown-sources-idUSKBN1D81ET

Nach einem Gewinnsprung im ersten Halbjahr erwartet Konzernchef Wolfgang Eder dank eines generellen konjunkturellen Aufschwungs in den kommenden sechs bis zwölf Monaten eine anhaltend positive Entwicklung. “Unser Ausblick erscheint gut oder sogar sehr gut abgesichert. Es wäre aber zu früh, hier eine andere Indikation zu geben”, sagte der Manager am Mittwoch. Der operative Gewinn (Ebit) legte in dem bis Ende September laufenden ersten Halbjahr um mehr als die Hälfte auf 584,2 Millionen Euro zu.

Für das bis Ende März laufende Geschäftsjahr bekräftigte der Konzern, der unter anderem die deutschen Premium-Autobauer mit Blechen und Karosserieteilen beliefert, einen deutlichen Anstieg von Umsatz und Gewinn. Gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters gab sich Eder Mitte August präziser und stellte bei einem Konzernumsatz von über zwölf Milliarden Euro einen deutlich höheren operativen Gewinn in Aussicht. Im Geschäftsjahr 2016/17 erzielte der Konzern mit weltweit rund 50.000 Mitarbeitern Erlöse in der Höhe von 11,3 Milliarden Euro. Der Betriebsgewinn lag bei 840 Millionen Euro.

Eine konkrete Prognose wagte der Firmenchef nun nicht. “Manches ist nicht wirklich kalkulierbar”, begründete Eder die Vorsicht. Die amerikanische Wirtschaftspolitik sei etwa noch immer ein Unsicherheitsfaktor. Man habe aber gelernt damit zu leben, sagte Eder. “Es gibt viele Ankündigungen, wir unterschätzen das nicht. Unsere Task Force USA beschäftigt sich damit.” US-Präsident Donald Trump hatte den europäischen Stahlfirmen mit Strafzöllen und Importbeschränkungen gedroht.

In China sei dagegen eine positive Entwicklung zu beobachten. Die Regierung in dem Land will Überkapazitäten in der Stahlindustrie abbauen. “Es scheint so, als ob die ersten 100 Millionen Tonnen still gelegt werden. Das ist eine vernünftige Maßnahme, aber nur ein Tropfen auf dem heißen Stein”, sagte Eder. Die Stahlbranche rund um ThyssenKrupp ächzt seit Jahren unter Überkapazitäten, Preisdruck und Billigimporten aus China.

In a statement on Monday, the Security Council had urged Myanmar to “ensure no further excessive use of military force” and expressed “grave concern over reports of human rights violations and abuses in Rakhine State”.

Responding, Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi, whose less than two-year-old civilian administration shares power with the military, said the issues facing Myanmar and Bangladesh could only be resolved bilaterally, a point she says was ignored in the Security Council statement.

“Furthermore, the (Security Council) Presidential Statement could potentially and seriously harm the bilateral negotiations between the two countries which have been proceeding smoothly and expeditiously,” Suu Kyi’s office said in a statement.

In contrast, Bangladesh issued a statement saying Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali “appreciated the recent statement of the U.N. Security Council” during a meeting with a new resident coordinator of the United Nations in Bangladesh.

The Myanmar statement said Ali had been invited to Myanmar on Nov. 16 and Nov. 17, but Bangladeshi officials told Reuters that the earliest the talks were likely to take place was during the minister’s visit for a regional meeting in the Myanmar capital of Naypyidaw on Nov. 20 and Nov. 21.

The two sides have to agree a process for repatriation of Rohingya, with Bangladesh reluctant to fall back on the drill used for the return of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar in the 1990s, as it wants a more lasting solution.

A senior Bangladesh foreign ministry official said the United Nations should be involved in the process this time.

“For years, we tried to resolve this issue bilaterally with Myanmar, but it was in vain,” the official told Reuters. “This problem is not going to be resolved anytime soon. The UN’s involvement in the process is a must.”

A sour note was struck over the talks last week, as Bangladesh officials voiced outrage over Suu Kyi’s spokesman casting suspicion that Bangladesh might drag its feet over the repatriation process in order to first secure hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid money.

Speaking at a conference for Commonwealth countries’ parliamentarians in Dhaka on Sunday, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called for more international pressure on Myanmar.

“I would request all of you to discuss Rohingya issue with utmost priority and exert pressure on the Myanmar government to stop the persecution of its citizens and take them back at the earliest,” she said.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to visit Myanmar on Nov. 15, with moves afoot in Washington to table a bill calling for sanctions on Myanmar that specifically target the military and related business interests.

In a nod to China, the Myanmar statement said it appreciated the stand taken by some members of the Security Council who upheld the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries.

To appease council veto powers Russia and China, Britain and France dropped a push for the Security Council to adopt a resolution on the situation and the 15-member body instead unanimously agreed on a formal statement.

MORE BOATS REACH BANGLADESH

The United Nations has denounced the violence during the past 10 weeks as a classic example of ethnic cleansing to drive the Rohingya Muslims out of Buddhist majority Myanmar.

Rejecting that accusation, the military says its counter-insurgency clearance operation was provoked by Rohingya militants’ synchronized attacks on 30 security posts in the northern part of Rakhine State on Aug. 25.

Rohingya refugees say the military torched their villages, but the military say the arsonists were Rohingya militants. The refugees’ have given harrowing accounts of rape and murder. Myanmar says those accusations will have to be investigated.

Meantime, the exodus from Rakhine continues. Several thousand Rohingya reached Bangladesh last week, many wading through shallows on the Naf river on the boundary between the two countries, and some making a short, but perilous sea crossing in small boats.

On Wednesday, 52 Rohingya came ashore in Bangladesh on a raft lashed together from bamboo and plastic jerrycans, having been unable to find a boat to take them, Shariful Islam, a Bangladesh border guard official, told Reuters.

On Tuesday, border guards told Reuters of at least two other boats with 68 Rohingya reaching Cox’s Bazar, where they would join the multitude sheltering in refugee camps.

Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who defied the junta that ruled Myanmar for decades, has been pilloried abroad for not speaking out more forcefully to rein in the military.

Last week she visited Rakhine for the first time since the crisis erupted, meeting community leaders and seeing the efforts to deliver aid and return the region to some semblance of normality.

She has spoken of plans for repatriation centers at which refugees will have to prove they once lived in Rakhine, before being allowed to return.

FILE PHOTO: Houses are seen submerged in flood waters caused by Tropical Storm Harvey in Northwest Houston, Texas, U.S. on August 30, 2017. REUTERS/Adrees Latif/File Photo

The SmarterSafer coalition sent a letter to members of the U.S. House urging passage of the compromise legislation that would extend to 2022 the federal program that has been heavily utilized after vast flooding from hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

“This legislative package moves the flood program in the right direction and contains needed reforms that will better protect those in harm’s way, the environment, and taxpayers,” the letter states, according to a copy seen by Reuters.

The hurdle came with the House Rules Committee indefinitely postponed a hearing on the bill that was scheduled for Tuesday night.

“Clearly they’re trying to make sure they’ve got all their ducks in a row and they’ve got all the votes they need,” said Steve Ellis, with the conservative group Taxpayers for Common Sense, which is part of a coalition pushing for reform of the program.

Joshua Saks, the legislative director of the National Wildlife Federation, said one of the shortcomings of the compromise is that it does not ensure that the money for flood mitigation projects will ever be spent.

“We need an Apollo project of mitigation right now, we need billions right now up front,” Saks said, referring to the project that put a man on the moon.

Two prominent Republican members of the U.S. House announced last week they had struck a deal that would extend the life of the program that covers most of the nation’s flood-prone properties.

Vehicles of every sort already are starting to add wireless chips to download everything from maps to entertainment, and in a few years nearly every new car may be connected. Self-driving cars, still in test mode, will accelerate the move.

“The amount of chips per car is going to grow dramatically,” said Egil Juliussen, a principal analyst for automotive technology at IHSMarkit.

Chip makers are scrambling to create new mobile networks, the so-called fifth generation, which will link phones as well as cars, drones and even industrial devices such as smart street lights, which count pedestrians and send data to city planners.

Qualcomm long was the dominant communications chip maker for mobile phones, although computer chip maker Intel has begun muscling into the space. Each now supplies about half Apple Inc’s iPhone communications chips, for instance.

Now they are jockeying in a mature market to design so-called 5G networks that will be up to 10 times as fast as wireless networks today, which are expected to start rolling out in 2020. Research firm IDC predicts 1.53 billion smart phones will be shipped in 2017 expanding to only 1.77 billion units in 2021.

The market for modem chips for cars, by contrast, is expected to grow sharply. Tristan Gerra, a senior semiconductor analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co, said that this year, only about 12 million of the 90 million cars manufactured per year have internet connectivity. But connectivity will become ubiquitous on self-driving cars.

“You basically (will) have 80 million units per year that are going to get a modem,” he said.

Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment.

Qualcomm itself is trying to buy NXP Semiconductors, a maker of automotive chips from so-called “infotainment” system chips to camera systems, for $38 billion. It is unclear whether that deal will go through and whether Broadcom would take on NXP, but Broadcom has said it is willing to do so.

A tie-up between the three companies could create a formidable competitor in the automotive chip space, said IHSMarkit’s Juliussen. He views Intel and Nvidia Corp, which make both make the main processors used in self-driving vehicles, as leaders in the young market, but a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm-NXP would be a strong third-place.

Intel has bought itself into relationships with autonomous car developers thanks to its acquisition of vision system maker Mobileye. Broadcom would get something similar with NXP, Juliussen said.

If Broadcom pulls off both deals, its market position in some areas could be dominant, said Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman.

Saudi Arabia said its air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired from warring Yemen over the capital Riyadh on Saturday. The rocket was brought down near King Khaled Airport on the northern outskirts of the capital.

Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war.

“Houthi missile attacks against Saudi Arabia, enabled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, threaten regional security and undermine UN efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict,” the White House said in a statement as U.S. President Donald Trump began a visit to the Chinese capital.

Uma das propostas sobre a mesa, segundo uma das fontes, seria a manutenção do abono apenas para quem ganha um salário mínimo, o que poderia gerar economia de cerca de 20 bilhões de reais em um ano. Para ter acesso ao benefício hoje, o trabalhador precisa ter recebido remuneração mensal média de até dois salários mínimos durante o ano-base.

Instituído por lei de 1990, o abono equivale a um valor de, no máximo, um salário mínimo ao ano para os beneficiários.

As fontes ressaltaram, contudo, que medidas nesse sentido dariam fôlego de curto prazo, mas não diminuiriam a necessidade de mudanças estruturais nas regras para concessão de aposentadorias.

Em estudo divulgado em abril, a Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Econômico (OCDE) já havia destacado a necessidade de revisão do benefício, estimando que sua limitação a quem ganha um salário mínimo reduziria em 80 por cento os recursos gastos com o abono, atualmente na casa de 0,3 por cento do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB).

As discussões sobre de esforços adicionais para equacionar o desequilíbrio nas contas públicas têm ganhado força diante do impasse na reforma da Previdência.

O governo enfrenta dificuldades políticas para conseguir passar a matéria no Congresso Nacional, tanto pela aproximação do ano eleitoral de 2018 quanto pelo desgaste político após Temer ter negociado com a base para segurar denúncias contra ele.

Nesta manhã, o ministro da Fazenda, Henrique Meirelles, afirmou que não há decisão concreta sobre a estratégia para votação do texto e que o governo segue empenhado em conversas com lideranças parlamentares para aprovação das alterações ainda neste ano.

Praticamente no mesmo momento, o deputado Darcísio Perondi (PMDB-RS), um dos vice-líderes do governo na Câmara, disse que a base governista vai apresentar uma emenda substitutiva para a reforma, acrescentando que há relativo consenso em relação à idade mínima, mas o tempo de contribuição ainda vai ser discutido.

As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.

Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut.

As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.

The “whatever it takes” pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.

“You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,” said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. “Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.”

The oil price decline and Saudi’s ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia’s future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.

Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices.

WAITING IT OUT

Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.

They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.

OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.

“We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. “But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,” he added.

An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.

OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.

Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel.

Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil.

SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE

""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.

The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country’s total crude output.

Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.

“A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.

MISTAKES OF THE PAST

Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.

Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC’s other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even “the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at”.

That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts.

“For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,” said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.

Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-markets-slump/traders-test-opec-whatever-it-takes-resolve-to-defend-oil-price-idUSKBN19D1PX

The officials said the man was now in the custody of the Department of Justice and being transported back to the United States by the military.

They added that the operation was authorized by President Donald Trump and had notified the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord.

In a statement, Trump said al-Imam “will face justice in the United States for his alleged role in the September 11, 2012 attacks.”[nW1N1N000Y]

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said al-Imam was now in custody and the United States would continue to investigate and identify those who were involved in the attack.

The appropriate Congressional committees and the families of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack had also been notified, the officials said.

The attack on the embassy was the topic of numerous congressional hearings, with Republican lawmakers critical of the way in which then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton responded to the attack.

Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors opened their case against the suspected ringleader, Ahmed Abu Khatallah.

Khatallah had been awaiting trial since 2014, when he was captured by a team of U.S. military and FBI officials in Libya and transported on a 13-day journey to the United States aboard a Navy vessel.

Militants have exploited chaos following Muammar Gaddafi’s 2011 downfall.

Islamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city.

Islamic State militants has shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya’s political divisions after their defeat in Sirte.

The United States has been carrying out strikes against the militant group in Libya, striking more than a dozen militants in September.",U.S. captures suspected Benghazi attack militant,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-libya-military/u-s-captures-suspected-benghazi-attack-militant-idUSKBN1CZ2CK

The Swiss 19-time grand slam champion had encouraging words for his friend and rival while helping Murray start his comeback gently by playing him in a charity match in Glasgow on Tuesday.

Former world number one Murray, who has been sidelined with a hip injury since Wimbledon, is targeting a return in the New Year with a view to competing at the Australian Open.

Federer, who was in a similar position last year when he missed the second half of the season through injury, took time out to completely recover and was rewarded with a spectacular return in 2017 featuring two grand slam triumphs.

Before beating Murray in the knockabout exhibition match, Federer told the three-time grand slam winner: ”My best advice is just to get fit again. Take your time, however long it takes.

”When you come back you want to be at 100 percent, otherwise the problem is you feel you just can’t beat the best at the big tournaments, so it’s wise and worthwhile to take the extra week, extra month maybe.

“I‘m sure Andy has a lot of years left so there shouldn’t be a hurry but as a professional athlete, you always want to come back as quickly as possible and you need to have goals but sometimes they need to be postponed.”

It is extraordinary how the pair’s fortunes have changed in 12 months, but the experience of 36-year-old Federer can act as an inspiration to a player six years his junior.

This time last year, Murray had just achieved his ambition of becoming world number one while questions were being asked about Federer’s future after his injury-decimated campaign.

Yet the Swiss returned to win the Australian Open and Wimbledon, shoot back up to number two in the world and play some of the best tennis of his garlanded career while injury-hit Murray’s form and confidence dipped.

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do. Two people briefed on the talks told Reuters the government has sought as long as 10 years for such conditions while AT&T has pressed for a shorter period.",AT&T says timing of Time Warner deal completion now uncertain,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a/att-says-timing-of-time-warner-deal-completion-now-uncertain-idUSKBN1D81Z8?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews

While North Korea and trade are set to dominate the formal part of the visit, which ends on Friday, China has been keen to show the importance it puts on Trump’s visit, the first by a foreign leader since the end of a key Communist Party congress last month where Xi cemented his power.

Trump and his wife Melania were whisked from Beijing airport - where they were met by China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a key player in the outreach to Trump since he won election a year ago - straight to the Forbidden City.

Chatting over cups of tea, Trump showed Xi a video of his granddaughter Arabella Kushner singing in Mandarin and reciting classical Chinese poetry, prompting Xi to compliment her performance as worthy of an “A+”, Chinese state media said.

Xi said he hoped Arabella would visit China soon, noting that she was already a “child star” in China, the official Xinhua news agency said.

A video of Arabella reciting a Chinese poem went viral on Chinese social media shortly after Trump’s election last year.

In another break from precedent, Xi himself gave the Trumps a tour of the imperial treasures of the Forbidden City, a UNESCO World Heritage site cleared of tourists for the day, before the two first couples watched Chinese opera and an acrobatic display.

“That’s something!” Trump said after the show, as he and Xi walked away. “We’re having a great time.”

China had widely been expected to pull out all the stops for Trump, who has pressed it to do more to control its neighbor North Korea, and resolve a yawning trade gap with the United States.

The ceremony on Trump’s arrival at Beijing’s airport on Wednesday was also more elaborate than usual, with the Trumps met by a marching band and soldiers standing at attention. Smartly dressed children waving miniature Chinese and American flags jumped up and down as Trump’s motorcade passed.

In another rare, if not unprecedented step, Trump’s official ceremonial welcome at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday will be broadcast live on national television, state broadcaster CCTV said.

While the sprawling palace complex in the centre of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to provide a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.",China's Xi fetes Trump on first day of Beijing trip,https://in.reuters.com/article/trump-asia-china-hospitality/chinas-xi-fetes-trump-on-first-day-of-beijing-trip-idINKBN1D81J8

Ahead of the election, some market strategists found it difficult to plan financially for Trump’s possible presidency, in part because many of his proposals were seen as contradictory or lacking in detail.

However, at the close of trading of that session, Dow futures had reversed the drop to close up nearly 250 points, above 18,500.

That is the lowest they have been since then.

Despite not having a single major legislative victory and with prospects for a government shutdown in December looming, stocks have not looked back in the Trump era.

The S&P 500 .SPX is up 21.1 percent since the 2016 election, while the Dow .DJI has gained 28.5 percent in that period and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC is up 30.3 percent.

Banks and technology have been the best performers over the past year, with telecommunication services the weakest performer.

The Dow has closed at a record high more than 70 times since election day 2016 and the S&P 500 has closed at a record on 52 days in 2017 -the fifth-most in any year, but it could challenge the 59 record closes in 1928 for third place or the 62 in 1964 for second, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The year with the most S&P record closing highs is 1995 with 77. There were 53 in 2014.

Economic growth across the globe, alongside stimulative monetary policy from the world's largest central banks, have been behind the market's rally. The expectation of pro-growth and business-friendly policies from the Trump administration as well as bets on deregulation, gave investors further reasons to invest in stocks.

Islamic State has been all but destroyed over the past two years, remaining only in Albu Kamal in Syria, Rawa in Iraq, in a few neighboring villages and patches of desert, and some isolated pockets elsewhere.

At the height of its power in 2015, it ruled over an expanse of the two countries, eradicating their border, printing money, imposing draconian laws and plotting attacks across the world.

On Wednesday, the army and its allies surrounded Albu Kamal and started to enter it, the pro-Hezbollah al-Manar television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, reported that Iraqi militias had crossed into Syria to join the assault, but they denied it.

Despite its losses, Islamic State still has a territorial presence in Libya and elsewhere, and many governments expect it to remain a threat even after it loses the caliphate it declared from Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.

It has already carried out a series of guerrilla operations in both Iraq and in Syria, and it has continued to inspire lone militants to attack civilian targets in the West.

In Syria, the end of major battle operations against Islamic State may only prefigure a new phase of the war, as the rival forces which have seized territory from the jihadists square off.

The Syrian army, alongside its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias, and backed by Iran and Russia, have seized swathes of central and eastern Syria in an advance against Islamic State this year.

Russian official media have in recent weeks reported a surge of strategic bombing and cruise missile strikes on Islamic State targets in eastern Syria as the army advanced.

A U.S.-backed coalition has supported a rival campaign in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that have pushed Islamic State from much of the country’s north and east.

NEW PHASE

The Syrian government has sworn to recapture territory held by the SDF, including Islamic State’s former capital Raqqa and oil and gas fields lying east of the Euphrates.

In areas controlled by the SDF in northern Syria, Kurdish-led groups have established autonomy, announcing elections and setting internal policies.

On Tuesday, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, described the U.S. forces aiding the SDF in Syria as illegal invaders. Washington has not spelled out how its military support for the SDF would evolve after Islamic State’s defeat.

Shaaban also pointed, in a television interview, to the example of Iraq, where the government retaliated against an autonomous Kurdish region after it held an independence referendum.

Iraqi military officials say small groups of Islamic State militants are still entrenched in the town of Rawa and the border desert strip with Syria. Scattered villages near al-Qaim, close to Albu Kamal, are still under militant control in an area called Rummana.

The Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an alliance of militias, denied a report by the Observatory that it had crossed the Syrian border and was attacking Albu Kamal.

“Our movements are carried out under orders from the commander in chief of the armed forces and our key objective is to liberate Iraq’s territories from Daesh. We have no orders to cross the borders,” PMF spokesman Ahmed al-Asadi said.",Syrian army starts assault on last IS stronghold,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-islamic-state/syrian-army-starts-assault-on-last-is-stronghold-idUSKBN1D81NM?il=0

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do. Two people briefed on the talks told Reuters the government has sought as long as 10 years for such conditions while AT&T has pressed for a shorter period.",AT&T says timing of Time Warner deal completion now uncertain,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a/att-says-timing-of-time-warner-deal-completion-now-uncertain-idUSKBN1D81Z8

But although the lawyer and two experts said the company should have disclosed the transaction, Steinhoff and one other academic that Reuters spoke to said it might not necessarily be required.
A spokesman for Steinhoff said the company complied with all reporting requirements including internal accounting rules and the Prospectus Directive.
“All transactions to and from Steinhoff to GT Branding Holding are not material in a qualitative and quantitative way.
“INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW”The loans came shortly after Steinhoff bought the 45 percent stake in GT Branding Holding.","LONDON (Reuters) - German-listed Steinhoff International (SNHG.DE) did not tell investors about almost $1 billion in transactions with a related company despite laws that some experts believe require it to do so, a Reuters examination of filings and prospectuses has found.

European financial disclosure rules, including the European Union Prospectus Directive, say publicly traded companies must disclose all transactions that are material in the prospectuses they present before a debt or equity sale.

The law says a material transaction is one that is big enough to influence investors’ view of the firm’s financial health. However, the law does not define the details of a material transaction.

One lawyer and two accounting academics told Reuters the transaction was large enough to be material.

The EU rules also require disclosure of all transactions with related parties. Those three experts said this would apply to Steinhoff because the transactions involved a company called GT Branding Holding, in which it holds a minority stake.

But although the lawyer and two experts said the company should have disclosed the transaction, Steinhoff and one other academic that Reuters spoke to said it might not necessarily be required.

Two traders said Steinhoff’s shares fell in response to the Reuters report. Shares were down 4.6 percent at 3.59 euros at 1350 GMT. Investors said the company would be under pressure to release more information on the transactions.

Accounts and incorporation documents filed with Swiss, Austrian and German corporate registries show that in 2015 Europe’s second-largest furniture group by sales bought a 45 percent stake in Swiss company GT Branding Holding and then lent it around 810 million Swiss francs ($810 million).

The details in the publicly available company filings have not previously been reported.

Professor Emilios Avgouleas, University of Edinburgh Chair in International Banking Law and Finance, said that the potentially market-sensitive information should have been clearly flagged.

“That transaction should be disclosed to investors. It’s a material transaction and arguably it can lend itself to all kinds of distortions of the share price,” he told Reuters.

Dennis Jullens, lecturer in accounting at the University of Amsterdam, said the rules were less clear-cut.

“The rules don’t say exactly what size transactions need to be disclosed so there is some judgment involved,” he said, adding that, conceivably, a company might argue a large transaction was not material or that very small related party transactions didn’t need to be disclosed.

A spokesman for Steinhoff said the company complied with all reporting requirements including internal accounting rules and the Prospectus Directive.

“TRANSACTIONS NOT MATERIAL”

The company operates across many jurisdictions so many laws will apply. However, as a Dutch-registered and German-listed company, the most important rules it must comply with are those countries’ local regulations and the EU Prospectus Directive.

The transactions were not disclosed in Steinhoff’s 2015 or 2016 annual reports, share prospectuses in August 2015 and Nov 2015 and a debt prospectus published in July 2017.

The Steinhoff spokesman said the company did not need to provide detailed information about the loans, share purchase or royalties it paid to GT Branding’s subsidiary because they did not have a major impact on profitability.

“All transactions to and from Steinhoff to GT Branding Holding are not material in a qualitative and quantitative way. Therefore in line with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) requirements no related party disclosure was presented in Steinhoff’s group financial statements,” he said.

Spokespeople for the AMF, the financial regulator in the Netherlands where Steinhoff International is registered, German regulator Bafin, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Steinhoff’s auditor Deloitte all declined to comment on Steinhoff’s filings.

A spokeswoman for the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said it did not comment on individual cases and said national authorities were responsible for enforcement of the EU directive.

Luxembourg financial regulator Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier approved a 2017 Steinhoff bond prospectus. A spokesman declined to say if it would investigate whether the company should have disclosed the transactions.

“INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW”

The loans came shortly after Steinhoff bought the 45 percent stake in GT Branding Holding. This created a related party relationship between the two groups.

Campion Capital SA owns the other 55 percent. Campion did not reply to emails and phone calls, and Steinhoff declined to answer questions about Campion’s ownership.

GT Branding Holding’s main asset is another Swiss company called GT Global Trademarks, which trademark registers show owns around 200 brands used by Steinhoff. Steinhoff used to own GT Global Trademarks.

At the end of 2015, the GT Branding debt represented 3.2 percent of Steinhoff’s total assets.

Three experts said this was significant enough to be above the reporting threshold laid out in the EU Prospectus Directive. It requires the disclosure of any information that could influence an investor’s view of the company’s financial health.

A Steinhoff spokesman said while the interest on the loans and royalty payments were related party transactions, they did not need to be disclosed because when netted off, the amount of money flowing between the companies was small.

Kecskes Andras, head of Department of Economic and Trade Law at the University of Pecs in Hungary, said transactions with associated companies worth hundreds of millions of euros should be disclosed.

Steinhoff, which owns Poundland in Britain, Mattress Firm in the United States and Conforama in France, is under investigation for suspected accounting irregularities by the state prosecutor in Oldenburg, Germany.

That investigation is ongoing and Steinhoff denies all wrongdoing.

Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, are charged with conspiring with four North Korean fugitives to kill the North Korean leader’s half-brother using banned chemical weapon VX, at the Kuala Lumpur international airport on Feb. 13.

Defense lawyers say the women were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a reality TV show.

Closed circuit television recordings played in court on Wednesday showed three of the fugitives at the airport in a car registered to a North Korean suspect named Ri Jong Chol.

Jong Chol, who was arrested and deported shortly after the murder, told investigators the car had been bought in his name by a North Korean embassy official named Chal Su in October 2016, lead investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz said.

“We made a request to the North Korean embassy to identify and question Chal Su, but did not receive any cooperation,” Wan Azirul told the court.

Airport video recordings screened in court earlier showed the embassy’s second secretary and a manager for North Korean airline Air Koryo helping the four fugitives flee immediately after the murder.

Wan Azirul on Wednesday named the two individuals as North Korean embassy second secretary Hyon Kwang Song and Air Koryo manager Kim Uk Il.

Both men had gone into hiding at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, along with Ri Ji U, a 30-year-old North Korean also known as James, after warrants were issued for their arrest, Wan Azirul said.

Police took statements from the embassy’s second secretary and the Air Koryo official before releasing them, but did not pursue Ji U or Chal Su in the absence of instructions to do so, Wan Azirul said.

“During this probe, which involves international issues, I faced many constraints in investigating and needed to refer to my superior officers before taking any action,” he added.

North Korea has vehemently denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some South Korean lawmakers have said.

The murder unraveled once-close ties between Malaysia and North Korea.

Statistics Canada on Friday reported a net gain of 35,300 jobs - all of them due to a boost in full-time positions - but added the jobless rate had edged up to 6.3 percent as more people sought work.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 15,000 extra jobs and predicted the unemployment rate would stay at 6.2 percent.

The Bank of Canada, citing the need to remove monetary stimulus as the economy strengthened, raised interest rates in July and September and said it would closely review data before deciding whether to hike again.

Average hourly wages were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest year-over-year increase since April 2016.

“Most importantly, we saw a little bit more acceleration in wages ... the labor data does support tighter (monetary) policy at some point next year and perhaps sooner than later,” said Andrew Kelvin, a senior rates strategist at TD Securities.

The Bank of Canada said last week various measures of wage growth remained below their historical averages.

The Canadian dollar quickly rose to C$1.2728 against the greenback, or 78.57 U.S. cents, up from C$1.2829, or 77.95 U.S. cents before the report was released.

Statscan said full-time employment jumped by 88,700 jobs while part-time positions dipped by 53,400.

On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 308,100, or 1.7 percent, while the six-month average for employment growth was 29,700 jobs, up from 24,300 in September.

“But I think they need to see more evidence before they can consider raising rates again,” he said in a phone interview.

Separate trade data for September was much gloomier, possibly tempering the central bank’s enthusiasm for a third rate hike in quick succession.

Statscan said the trade deficit remained at C$3.18 billion ($2.50 billion) as imports and exports dropped for a fourth consecutive month.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$3.00 billion. Since Statscan started compiling trade data in 1946, exports and imports never both declined for four months in a row.

And in this case, it’s working hard to stay on regulators’ good side.

Uber said it was the first formal services contract by the U.S. National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) covering low-altitude airspace rather than outer space. NASA has used such contracts to develop rockets since the late 1950s.

Holden is set to reveal the company’s latest air taxi plans at Web Summit, an annual internet conference taking place in Lisbon this week.

“There is a reality that Uber has grown up a lot as a company,” Holden said in an interview ahead of his speech. “We are now a major company on the world stage and you can’t do things the same way where you are a large-scale, global company that you can do when you are a small, scrappy startup.”

Uber has faced endless regulatory and legal battles around the world since it launched its ride-hailing services earlier this decade, including a recent showdown in London, where it is battling to retain its license after having been stripped of it by city regulators over safety concerns. [nL8N1MO228]

The company is looking to speed development of a new industry of electric, on-demand, urban air taxis, Holden said, which customers could order up via smartphone in ways that parallel the ground-based taxi alternatives it has popularized while expanding into more than 600 cites since 2011.

The company plans to introduce paid, intra-city flying taxi services from 2023 and is working closely with aviation regulators in the United States and Europe to win regulatory approvals toward that end, a senior Uber executive told Reuters.

“We are very much embracing the regulatory bodies and starting very early in discussions about this and getting everyone aligned with the vision,” he said of Uber’s plans to introduce what he called “ride-sharing in the sky”.

MAKING TAXIS FLY

The contract with NASA is to solve the problem of operating hundreds or thousands of aircraft over urban areas with the goal of enabling uberAIR services to operate alongside existing air traffic control systems and in and around busy airports.

NASA was not immediately available to comment on the deal. Earlier this month it said it was working with a variety of companies, large and small, to develop the emerging market for what it terms Urban Air Mobility, or UAM.

Uber envisions a fleet of electric jet-powered vehicles - part helicopter, part drone and part fixed-wing aircraft - running multiple small rotors capable of both vertical take off and landing and rapid horizontal flight.

Two larger rotors used to lift the plane transition during flight into forward-thrusting propellers in newly released designs.

It plans to build no aircraft itself.

Instead, Uber is building the software to manage networks in the sky of flying taxis, while relying on a stable of manufacturers, including Aurora Flight Sciences, which was acquired by Boeing (BA.N) last month.

Uber has also signed up Embraer (EMBR3.SA), Mooney, Bell Helicopter - a unit of Textron (TXT.N) -, and Pipistrel Aircraft to build new vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.

It is also working with real estate developers Sandstone Properties in Los Angeles to build rooftop landing pads on skyscrapers from which it aims to offer its uberAIR services. It plans to start offering services from locations near a downtown sports arena, the international airport, Santa Monica and Sherman Oaks in suburban San Fernando Valley, the company said.",NASA contracts Uber to build flying taxi air control software,https://www.reuters.com/article/portugal-websummit-uber/nasa-contracts-uber-to-build-flying-taxi-air-control-software-idINKBN1D81I2?il=0

Previously, AT&T had said the $85.4 billion acquisition, announced in October 2016, would close by the end of this year.

Shares of Time Warner fell 2.6 percent to $92.18 in early trading while AT&T was down 0.2 percent to $33.01.

The deal is opposed by an array of consumer groups and smaller television networks on the grounds that it would give AT&T too much power over the content it would distribute to its wireless customers. Time Warner owns cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused Time Warner’s CNN and other media of being unfair to him, criticized the deal on the campaign trail last year and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.

“All approvals have been received but for the DOJ,” AT&T’s Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a conference in New York.

“We are in active discussions with the DOJ. I cannot comment on those discussions,” he said. “But with those discussions I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.”

Stephens’ comments signal to investors that the Justice Department could sue to block or revise the merger and the company would fight in court to try to win approval, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

One sticking point in discussions is the length of time that the U.S. government wants to impose conditions on what AT&T can and cannot do.

China’s Communist Party has decided to insert his view of the world – “Xi Jinping Thought for the New Era of Socialism With Chinese Special Characteristics” – into the constitution. He will be only the second leader after Mao Zedong to be so honored during his lifetime. Xi stands supreme. Yet that very accumulation of authority carries a large threat, both to his power and to his state.

Xi’s central goals are to strengthen China’s economy and military power and to lead a sometimes-ferocious campaign against corruption, bolstering these aims with a steady determination to bring the news media back under the tightest control. Inserting both his thoughts and his name in the constitution will further delegitimize critical commentary and unflattering revelations by making anything that contradicts Xi’s official line an attack on the constitution. Xi wants to render independent journalism impossible and choke off China’s liveliest medium of criticism – social media. Blocking these arteries could be his largest mistake yet.

Xi’s desire to curb the media is not new. In 2013, the then-new leader gave a speech to the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference in Beijing, in which he argued that workers in propaganda and ideology – broadly speaking, journalists and their minders – had become so undisciplined that some bordered on committing treason. His subsequent actions have been consistent with this belief.

In a book published earlier this year, I wrote, “one phrase in his speech was particularly telling. Xi said that ‘we must unwaveringly persist in the principle that the Party manages the media, persist in politicians running newspapers periodicals, TV stations and news websites.’”

The words “politicians running newspapers” were telling because they were a direct quotation from Mao, the founder of communist rule, still venerated in spite of his murderous policies that condemned millions. The phrase enshrined the dogma that politicians – the Party – is the final judge of what journalism can say. Journalism was far too important to be left to journalists.

In the past five years, those newspapers and TV programs which had enjoyed some autonomy – granted by Deng Xiaoping who was in charge of economic and social reform from the late 1970s to the late 1980s – have lost nearly all of their latitude. Journalists no longer can undertake any investigation not expressly permitted by the all-powerful Publicity (formerly Propaganda) Department. Usually that only allowed for investigating the affairs of one whom the Party wished to destroy.

The most adventurous newspapers – such as the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Southern Weekend of Guangzhou – were muzzled in 2013. Xiao Shu, a former editorialist on the Southern Weekend, wrote that the appointment of a new, severe head of Party propaganda in Guangdong, the region in which Guangzhou is the capital, meant that “the press in Guangdong retreated into its darkest period since the start of Deng Xiaoping’s 'reform and opening up' policies in the late 1970s.”

That was just the start. The monopoly broadcaster, CCTV, dropped or toned down all its investigative and analytical programs. Journalists, who had previously suffered only dismissal if they were deemed to have gone too far, were again imprisoned. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 38 journalists were in prison in China in 2016, putting it second behind Turkey for number of reporters jailed. Writers for foreign news media find it harder to get visas and harder to do investigative reporting.

Yet for Xi and his senior colleagues, the largest threat is the social media – which have become more popular as approved journalism becomes again controlled. The online postings are often critical; an anonymous author wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this month that “even a cursory glance at China’s new social media revealed that officials were seen as skinning the people, not serving them.” These public comments could not be allowed in China. This autumn, the authorities began investigating the most popular messaging services – Weibo, Wechat and Baidu - and found that the services were exchanging “terror-related content… rumors… and pornography.”

Yet as this repression continued and deepened, the pushback from society grows, and determined journalists and film makers continue to catalogue the darker sides of China. In 2012, a film called “High Tech, Low Life” followed bloggers on bicycles examining government censorship and the harsh and yawning divisions in Chinese society.

Suppression of forbidden information and commentary is much harder now. The sinologist Perry Link said in 2014, “internally it’s getting more hard to handle, because complaints and demands from below are increasing and are better organized than before.” The middle class now numbers in the hundreds of millions: in five more years – within Xi’s presidential term - McKinsey reckons that 75 percent of China’s urban middle class will enjoy a standard of living approaching that of Italy.

This more independent, and often independent-minded, youngish cohort is rapidly growing, as is their use of social media. The meeting of these two forces is unlikely to favor an attitude of resigned obedience, the more so since many will have been abroad, and many more will read foreign material online.

The result is likely to foster a more inquiring and critical citizenry, tending to question why a political monopoly that once caused the deaths of millions and now chooses for its population what they should read, see and text to each other should rule unchallenged.

The gamble Xi is making, by hugging all power to him, is that he and the forces he controls can limit any such developments. But that will not last. Corruption, pollution, inequality, interfering bureaucracy and controlled media will become prompts for protest. Xi’s choice to strengthen authoritarian rule rather than loosen it will prove to be a large error, for himself, his country and beyond these, the world in which China is such a crucial actor.",Commentary: China's media crackdown won't work,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lloyd-china/commentary-chinas-media-crackdown-wont-work-idUSKBN1CW2JW

China claims almost the entire strategic waterway where $3 trillion worth of sea-borne goods passes every year, building and militarising artificial islands. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims.

“So, it’s about time, either in the bilateral or in the plenary, I should be bringing this important matter to the surface,” Duterte told reporters before leaving for Vietnam.

He said China had to make it clear to Southeast Asian countries its intentions in the South China Sea. “You want to control the passage or do we have the free passage?” he said, adding he would not be confrontational.

Since coming to office 16 months ago, the firebrand leader has been conciliatory to Beijing, despite a ruling from an international arbitration court favouring the Philippines in its territorial dispute with China.

In the past, Duterte has repeatedly said he will raise the sea dispute at the proper time and avoided the issue when Manila hosted two regional meetings this year.

The two countries will also negotiate a military protocol to avoid maritime “miscalculations”, Manila’s defence minister said on Wednesday following a brief standoff near a Philippine-occupied island in a disputed part of the South China Sea.

Delfin Lorenzana said the Philippines tried to put up makeshift structures on a sand bar about 4 km (2.5 miles) off Thitu island in the Spratly archipelago in August, but China objected and sent ships to the area.

Duterte sought to defuse tensions by ordering troops to pull out. Construction was stopped.

“We intend to sit down with China to draft and agree on a protocol to resolve immediately any incident,” he said, adding he hoped talks could start this year.

Home borrowing costs fell in step with bond yields in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s nomination last week of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to head the U.S. central bank. Powell, if confirmed, would succeed current chair Janet Yellen whose term expires in February.

Powell is seen as someone who would continue the Fed’s current approach to gradually raising interest rates and shrinking the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

Bond yields had spiked in October partly on worries Trump would select a candidate such as Stanford University economist John Taylor who is perceived to hold a hawkish view on monetary policy.

Benchmark yields have also retreated from their seven-month high after an October payrolls report that showed wage growth stalled and due to uncertainty over a Republican-sponsored bill aimed at overhauling the federal tax code.

Ross was speaking at a signing ceremony in the Chinese capital for commercial deals worth about $9 billion on Trump’s visit.

Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of China’s massive trade surplus with the U.S. - calling it “embarrassing” and “horrible” last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices, fuelling worries of increased tension between the world’s two largest trading countries.

“Addressing the imbalance in China trade has been the central focus of collaborative discussions between President Trump and President Xi and achieving fair and reciprocal treatment for the companies is a shared objective,” Ross said.

Data on Wednesday showed China’s exports to the U.S. rose 8.3 percent in October on the year, while imports grew 4.3 percent. That led to a trade surplus of $26.62 billion with the U.S. last month, down from September’s record $28.08 billion, but higher than recent trends.

Deals signed on Wednesday included a pledge by Chinese ecommerce company JD.com to buy more than $2 billion of food products from the U.S. over three years and a pact for Reignwood International to buy additional helicopters from U.S. firm Bell Helicopter.

While 19 deals were signed on Wednesday, some in the U.S. business community have expressed worry that contract wins could come at the expense of resolving long-standing complaints over market access restrictions in China.

At the ceremony, China’s vice premier Wang Yang said deals signed between China and U.S. firms would “contribute to the stabilization of the general and overall economic relations between the two countries”.

The ceremony was a prelude to a “more important” signing ceremony set for Thursday, he added. Among the companies expected to sign deals on Thursday are Qualcomm, Boeing and Goldman Sachs.

In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata sought court protection from creditors in June as costs and liabilities mounted from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits.

Its air bag inflators have been linked to at least 18 deaths and 180 injuries around the world because they can rupture and shoot metal fragments into vehicles.

Takata’s creditors, including automakers such as Honda Motor Co (7267.T), banks and bondholders, are seeking 3.77 trillion yen ($33.3 billion) from the supplier, mostly to cover recall costs, according to the filing outlining the company’s debt obligations, which hasn’t been made public.

Takata had cash and securities worth just 78 billion yen at end-March - equivalent to just 2 percent of the sum creditors are seeking. It also had tangible assets such as buildings and machinery worth 93 billion yen, but much of these went to the company’s purchaser and the rest is needed to make replacement inflators to supply the recalls.

Key Safety Systems, a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (600699.SS), agreed in June to buy Takata’s non-inflator assets, such as the seatbelt and air bag businesses, for $1.6 billion.

A spokesman for Takata declined to comment on the matter.

A Honda spokesman said: “We will continue to consider our legal options” to reach a financial settlement.

Automakers have recalled or expect to recall by 2019 about 125 million vehicles worldwide to replace air bag inflators, including more than 60 million in the United States.

As part of Takata’s bankruptcy restructuring plan, its steering committee recognizes debts of 1.05 trillion yen ($9.26 billion), accepting just 600 billion yen in recall-related costs, according to the filing submitted to the Tokyo District Court.

Takata aims to file its restructuring plan to that court by Nov. 27.

Honduras finished in fourth in the CONCACAF region of North and Central America and the Caribbean thanks to a last-day win over Mexico and will meet Australia at home on Nov. 10, before heading down under for the second-leg five days later.

The Central Americans have struggled recently, with just three wins in their last 16 matches, and Quioto admits they will need to produce their best form to qualify for next year’s tournament.

“I think it is one of the most important games of our lives,” he told Reuters. “It is the chance to go to the World Cup finals. We are going to give it everything.”

Quioto and his team mates have all stressed they need to take a decent result to Australia, whose only losses at home this year were to Brazil and Germany.

Honduras have recalled veteran striker Carlos Costly in the hope he can add to his tally of 32 goals in 75 international appearances and they were boosted earlier in the week with the inclusion of Eddie Hernandez, who is recovering quicker than expected from a cheek fracture.

Both sides have suspensions, with Honduras missing captain Maynor Figueroa and forward Alberth Elis for the first leg.

Australia, meanwhile, are sweating on the availability of veteran forward Tim Cahill, who flew to Honduras with his physio, in the hope of working his injured ankle into match readiness.

The Socceroos will also be without VfL Bochum striker Robbie Kruse, who has a knee injury, and Mark Milligan and Mathew Leckie are both suspended.

They can, however, count on ample playoff experience, most memorably in 2005, when they defeated two-time World Cup winners Uruguay.

This time they have the added disadvantage in having to make two very long trips and coach Ange Postecoglou said securing a result in Honduras will be crucial if their tired legs are to carry them to Russia.

“They know they’re going to have to get something out of that first game,” Postecoglou said.

Jong Chol, who was arrested and deported shortly after the murder, told investigators the car had been bought in his name by a North Korean embassy official named Chal Su in October 2016, lead investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz said.

“We made a request to the North Korean embassy to identify and question Chal Su, but did not receive any cooperation,” Wan Azirul told the court.

Airport video recordings screened in court earlier showed the embassy’s second secretary and a manager for North Korean airline Air Koryo helping the four fugitives flee immediately after the murder.

Wan Azirul on Wednesday named the two individuals as North Korean embassy second secretary Hyon Kwang Song and Air Koryo manager Kim Uk Il.

Both men had gone into hiding at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, along with Ri Ji U, a 30-year-old North Korean also known as James, after warrants were issued for their arrest, Wan Azirul said.

Police took statements from the embassy’s second secretary and the Air Koryo official before releasing them, but did not pursue Ji U or Chal Su in the absence of instructions to do so, Wan Azirul said.

“During this probe, which involves international issues, I faced many constraints in investigating and needed to refer to my superior officers before taking any action,” he added.

North Korea has vehemently denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some South Korean lawmakers have said.

The murder unravelled once-close ties between Malaysia and North Korea.

The players arrested were freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, according to USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and ESPN, all of which cited unnamed sources familiar with the incident. Ball is the younger brother of National Basketball Association rookie Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers.

Reached by telephone at a hotel in the eastern city of Hangzhou on Wednesday, Ball declined to comment. ESPN said the three had been picked up by police at their hotel on Tuesday and released on bail early on Wednesday. They were confined to their hotel pending legal proceedings, it said.

The University of California, Los Angeles, declined to confirm the arrests but said it was “aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China”.

“The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,” UCLA Athletics said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Shana Wilson.

The UCLA team had arrived in China on Sunday with plans to play Georgia Tech in both teams’ regular-season opener on Saturday, according to statements from both teams.

It traveled to Hangzhou, about three hours by bus from Shanghai, to visit the campus of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), sponsor of the annual Pac-12 games in China.

The three players were questioned about stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the hotel where the team is staying, ESPN said. UCLA representatives, including coach Steve Alford, were at the police station while they were there, it said, citing an unidentified source.

Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement the conference was “disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about.”

“Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation,” he said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday the Chinese government had reported the case to the U.S. side in accordance with consular agreements.

“China is handling this case in accordance with the law and will guarantee the lawful rights in accordance with the law of those involved in this case,” she said.

In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Arash Markazi, a senior writer at ESPN, LaVar Ball said his son, LiAngelo, would be fine.

“He’ll be fine. Everyone’s making it a big deal. It ain’t that big a deal,” said Ball, the outspoken CEO of athletic apparel maker Big Baller Brand.

Chinese President Xi Jinping led Trump on a private tour of the Forbidden City to kick off his visit on Wednesday.

White House officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Alibaba declined to comment, as did the Hangzhou police.

A U.S. State Department official said the department was aware of reports of three citizens arrested in China and stood ready to provide assistance but had no further comment due to privacy considerations.

Three players from Georgia Tech were questioned by the authorities in China on Tuesday at their hotel in Hangzhou but were later released by police, Georgia Tech athletics spokesman Mike Flynn said in a statement.

The details of the stake, revealed by Snapchat after badly received quarterly results, came as U.S. and Chinese firms announced $9 billion in new deals on the arrival of President Donald Trump in Beijing.

It helped the U.S. company recoup a slide of almost 20 percent in pre-trading in New York after it reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations.

Snap shares recovered to trade down 12 percent at $13.29 in premarket trading from a close of $15.12 on Tuesday.

Snap’s largely privately owned structure, which reserves 95 percent of voting rights for its co-founders, made it likely Tencent was just accumulating a financial stake.

“While such news may be initially perceived as positive by the market, one has to remember that Tencent’s holdings in Snap is the non-voting Class A shares, which makes a possible acquisition of Snap by Tencent less likely,” said Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.

Along with Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent has poured billions of cash from a decade of growth in China into buying U.S. firms and holds 5 percent of electric car maker Tesla, as well as stakes in ride service company Lyft and augmented reality startup Magic Leap.

The largest social media and gaming company in China and owner of the popular mobile application WeChat, it had previously invested in Snap through an affiliate in 2013, and has been referred as a “role model” by Snap’s co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel.

Snap said in its quarterly report that Tencent had bought 145.8 million shares of its non-voting Class A common stock on the open market. Snap had about 1.2 billion shares outstanding, as of Oct 31.(bit.ly/2zqvybE)

“The positive side of this could be that the two companies may create business partnership of some kind or Tencent may aid Snap in expanding its reach into China,” Morningstar’s Mogharabi said.

Unlike many U.S. stock market-listed corporations, Snap is not obligated to disclose changes in Tencent’s ownership of Snap’s Class A stock. Snap said it had only received the details of the stake from Tencent this month and declined to answer further questions on the filing.

Snap, on Tuesday, reported third-quarter revenue and user growth well below Wall Street expectations, as it struggles to compete with Facebook Inc’s Instagram. The company has disappointed investors each quarter since it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March.

Snap’s daily active users (DAU) stood at 178 million, below expectation of 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

M&S, one of the best known names in British retail, said it would speed up changes for clothing and homeware in its stores, including closures, cutting space and relocations. It also plans to open fewer Simply Food stores than previously planned.

Chief Financial Officer Helen Weir had decided to leave as soon as a successor was found. Weir, a former finance director at retailers John Lewis and Kingfisher, joined the company in April 2015.

M&S also said it would further modernize its clothing supply chain to make it faster and lower cost, set a target for a third of its clothing and homeware sales to be made online and plans to substantially reduce its cost base.

Shares in M&S, down 6 percent so far this year, opened up 4 percent on Wednesday before going into reverse to trade down 2 percent by 0835 GMT.

HIGH STRET, HARD TIMES

Chief Executive Steve Rowe is one year into a five-year turnaround he has said will dent short-term profits.

The 133-year-old M&S is battling to revive its fortunes after falling out of fashion over the last decade. Its task is being made harder by a squeeze on consumers’ spending power as inflation rises and wage growth falters. Last week UK interest rates also went up for the first time in a decade.

FILE PHOTO - A sign is seen on the exterior of a branch of Marks and Spencer in central London, Britain, November 3, 2017. Picture taken November 3, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville

“In clothing & home, early results are encouraging and in international we now have a profitable and robust business. We recognize now that we face stronger headwinds in food which will be addressed in the year ahead,” said Rowe.

“The business still has many structural issues to tackle as we embark on the next five years of our transformation, in the context of a very challenging retail and consumer environment.”

Rowe’s initial strategy was focused on reduced prices for basic clothing ranges, cutting back on clearance sales and promotions while improving fit, availability and customer service.

His plan also involved switching some UK shop floor space from clothing to food. M&S said last year it would close about 30 UK stores selling clothing, homeware and food and downsize or convert another 45 into food stores over five years.

NEW FACES

In September retail veteran Archie Norman became M&S chairman, while last month Jill McDonald, the former boss of Halfords (HFD.L), started as the boss of clothing, home and beauty.

M&S made a pretax profit before one-off items of 219.1 million pounds ($288.18 million) in the 26 weeks to Sept. 30 - ahead of analysts’ average forecast of 201 million pounds but below 231.3 million pounds made in the same period last year.

Political stalemate has gripped Kenya, East Africa’s most advanced economy and an ally of the West against militant Islam, since the Supreme Court annulled the results of the Aug. 8 presidential elections on procedural grounds and ordered a re-run.

The repeat election was held on Oct. 26 but opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted the vote, saying it would be unfair. Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta won a second, five-year term with 98 percent of the vote.

Lawmakers said on Wednesday that Odinga’s opposition coalition wanted more time to negotiate on the distribution of parliamentary leadership posts to its constituent parties.

The National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition has written to the speakers of the national assembly and senate asking to have until the end of November to fill leadership positions in the house, including minority chiefs, whips and committee heads.

“The NASA parliamentary group has asked the speaker to give them until end of the month to put their house in order,” Adan Duale, majority leader in the national assembly, told Reuters via text message, adding parliament would adjourn until Nov. 29.

Parliament runs its business through the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) and various committees, which set its calendar and the legislative agenda, approve expenditure and vet key appointments in the executive and the judiciary.

Ayub Savula, an opposition legislator, told Reuters the delays were due to disagreements between NASA’s four main parties - Odinga’s ODM, ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper - on how to share the available positions.

“Whereas ODM has a majority 70 MPs in the NASA team, the rest of the political parties under NASA feel it is better if the leadership is divided equally,” Savula said.

The delay has angered some, including lawmakers from the ruling Jubilee party.

One year ago, when it became clear that Trump had pulled a historic upset to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton to the U.S. presidency, futures in the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 900 points.

The play, which first premiered in London’s National theatre in 1983, charts two days in the life of a group of desperate Chicago real estate salesmen and chronicles the moral compromises they are willing to make in order to make a sale.

For director Sam Yates, whose London revival stars Hollywood actor Christian Slater, the play is an examination of how language is used to control people -- which Yates thinks hits home in the current political climate.

“We have a president in the United States who cut his teeth selling real estate in the 80s,” the director told Reuters.

“The way language is used by these guys in the play, there’s certainly many, many echoes with how you see Trump buying for time or covering up hugely lack of understanding or pushing something or selling something.”

The 1992 film version featured a bravura monologue of sinister masculinity from Alec Baldwin, who won an Emmy this year for his menacing Trump impersonation.

The workplace bullying on display in the play also strikes a chord at a time when Hollywood is experiencing its own scandals of sexual harassment and abuse.

Kevin Spacey, who played an abusive boss in the “Glengarry” film, was fired last week by Netflix from its hit show “House of Cards” after a number of allegations of sexual misconduct.

Slater, who is returning to the London stage more than a decade after an acclaimed run in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”, told Reuters that for too long Hollywood has been “sweeping so many things under the carpet and living with these hush-hush little secrets, that everybody kind of knows about but doesn’t really want to do anything about.”

“That era has to come to an end, women and men have to feel comfortable in the workplace, and in every place,” he said.

Auch zwei Ereignisse vom Donnerstag hallten noch nach und sorgten für positive Stimmung: die Ernennung von Jerome Powell zum Nachfolger von Janet Yellen an die Spitze der US-Notenbank und die Vorlage der mehrfach aufgeschobenen Steuer-Pläne der Republikaner um Präsident Donald Trump.

“There aren’t that many movies about the mother-daughter relationship and it’s such a rich, beautiful, complicated thing,” Gerwig said.
“I just was like, ‘Everybody’s got a mother so why aren’t there more things about this?","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “Why won’t you call me Lady Bird? You promised that you would.”

That is the line that popped into actor and filmmaker Greta Gerwig’s head one day and went on to become the opening statement from the precocious teenage heroine of her directorial debut, “Lady Bird.”

“Lady Bird, in a way, wrote herself,” Gerwig told Reuters on Sunday.

“I was like, ‘Who is this girl, who’s this girl who makes (people) call her by a different name?’ It’s one of those things where it’s like I discovered the character as I was writing.”

The titular character, played by Saoirse Ronan, is a teenage girl growing up “on the wrong side of the tracks” in Sacramento, California, attending Catholic school and wrestling with her identity as she figures out life after graduating from high school.

“I wanted to make a movie that was about home, and how home is something you only understand when you’re leaving,” said Gerwig, who grew up in Sacramento and pens a love letter to her home town in “Lady Bird.”

The film, which opened in limited theaters last week and will roll out in more U.S. theaters this month, marks the solo directing debut of Gerwig, 34. She carved a career co-writing and starring in independent darlings such as 2010’s “Greenberg” and 2012’s “Frances Ha.”

“Lady Bird” has already garnered critical praise and early awards buzz.

“She just has this unique lens of seeing the world,” actor Beanie Feldstein, who plays Lady Bird’s best friend Julie, said of Gerwig. “It makes so much sense that she were to direct because that lens has always existed in her acting and in her writing.”

In “Lady Bird,” Gerwig explores the complexities of her heroine’s various relationships, from her frustrations living in a cash-strapped home to the endearing connection with Julie and the innocence of her first love.

Gerwig said she wanted to reflect a “kaleidoscope of people” in Lady Bird’s life because “when she leaves, you have to feel like she’s really leaving an entire community.”

But at the core is Lady Bird’s evolving relationship with her mother, played by Laurie Metcalf, from explosive arguments and hurtful words to tender moments and a mutual desire to live up to each other’s expectations.

Tan added that if Broadcom acquires Qualcomm which in turn has acquired NXP, the combined company’s net debt could be in the range of $90 billion.

Broadcom also got a commitment letter for $5 billion in financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners, an existing Broadcom investor.","(Reuters) - Chip maker Broadcom Ltd made an unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc on Monday, setting the stage for a takeover battle that could reshape the industry at the heart of mobile phone hardware.

Qualcomm said it would review the proposal but the San Diego-based company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators may reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small, chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States, told Reuters he would not rule out a proxy fight to convince shareholders to replace the board and accept the offer.

“We are well advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” said Tan, who has pulled off a string of deals over the past decade. “We have a very strong desire to work with Qualcomm to reach a mutually beneficial deal.”

A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc.

Qualcomm shareholders, who have watched their investment sour over the past year in the face of a patent dispute with Apple, would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock in a deal, according to Broadcom’s proposal. Including debt, the transaction is worth $130 billion.

“Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” said GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives, who believes bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share. The offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday.

Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014. They rose 1.1 percent to $62.52, suggesting skepticism a deal would happen.

Broadcom shares rose 1.4 percent to $277.52 after touching a record of $281.80.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny, especially in China, which is home to expanding rivals. Chinese ambitions to buy U.S. chipmakers have been thwarted by U.S. regulators.

Qualcomm sells modem chips that allow phones to send data as well as communications chips for automobiles that handle “infotainment” systems and wireless electric vehicle charging.

Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data and is also in the process of closing a $38 billion bid for automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year.

Broadcom, Qualcomm and NXP together would have control over modems, Wi-Fi, GPS and near-field communications chips, a strong position that could concern customers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd because of the bargaining power such a combined company could have to raise prices. However, a combined company would also likely have a lower cost base and the flexibility to cut prices.

Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said that U.S. regulators would try to ensure the deal would not lead to higher chip prices.

”Based on what I’ve seen, it seems unlikely to me that there’s a basis for a challenge (to stop the deal),” he said.

Tan added that if Broadcom acquires Qualcomm which in turn has acquired NXP, the combined company’s net debt could be in the range of $90 billion.

Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary financing for the proposed transaction.

Slideshow (2 Images)

Broadcom also could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, raising as much at $25 billion from a sale, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah suggested.

Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion in cash as of Sept. 24. Broadcom also got a commitment letter for $5 billion in financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners, an existing Broadcom investor.

VULNERABLE QUALCOMM

Qualcomm stock has fallen this year because of a patent fight with Apple, which could quit using Qualcomm chips in its phones, and concerns that it may have to raise its bid for a NXP.

If Broadcom decides to make a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 10-member board by a Dec. 7 nomination deadline.

Two Qualcomm directors, Anthony Vinciquerra and Mark McLaughlin, have been aligned with activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, which pushed for a shakeup of the company two years ago. Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm board director, was added last year as a compromise candidate.

Apple, as a key customer, could play a key role. Analysts say that if Broadcom can salvage the Apple relationship, it would sharply increase potential returns from the takeover.

Tan also has a history of cutting costs at acquired companies, and Charter Equity analyst Ed Snyder predicted Tan would cut away waste at Qualcomm.

Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.","Broadcom bids $103 billion for Qualcomm, open to going hostile",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-bids-103-billion-for-qualcomm-open-to-going-hostile-idUSKBN1D61EO

Clear agreement on proceeding without the United States would be a boost for the principle of multilateral free trade pacts over the bilateral deal-making that Trump argues will give a better result for American workers.

Japan has been lobbying hard ahead of this week’s meetings on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to get full signoff on an agreement that is also a counterweight to China’s growing regional dominance.

But Canada, whose economy is the second biggest among the TPP-11 after Japan, has joined other countries seeking changes or with misgivings about moving too fast.

“Canada will not be rushed into a deal that is not in the best interest of Canada and of Canadians,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference in Vietnam’s capital Hanoi.

The TPP aims to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products across a bloc whose trade totaled $356 billion last year. It also has provisions for protecting everything from labor rights to the environment to intellectual property - one of the main sticking points.

The original 12 countries had reached agreement on the TPP in 2016, but Trump withdrew in one of his first acts in office - throwing its very survival into doubt.

FRIDAY MEETING

Trump and other APEC leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China and Russian President Vladimir Putin, will meet on Friday in the Vietnamese seaside resort of Danang.

Leaders of the TPP-11, all of which are also APEC members, will break away to consider proposals for proceeding with the trade deal that have been drawn up by their trade negotiators and ministers.

Japan had said it hoped a broad agreement could be reached among the 11 countries in Danang.

“This is not about Friday, it’s about the next decades,” Canada’s trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, told Reuters. “We are constructive, we are even creative at the table. At the same time we want to make sure we get the right deal.”

The positions of both Canada and Mexico are also complicated by the fact that they are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the Trump administration.

Also in doubt is the appetite of New Zealand’s new government to move ahead swiftly. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was too early to say a deal could be reached this week.

“We see a real responsibility to come in and make sure that the agreement is in the best interest of New Zealand,” she said.

Both Malaysia and Vietnam would have been big beneficiaries of the original agreement as a result of the removal of U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, with an election approaching and growing ties to Beijing, has less incentive to move ahead fast.

Among options being discussed by TPP countries is whether to suspend some provisions of the original agreement to avoid having to renegotiate it and potentially to entice the United States back in the long term, officials said.",Canada says won't be rushed on TPP trade deal at Asia-Pacific meeting,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit/canada-says-wont-be-rushed-on-tpp-trade-deal-at-asia-pacific-meeting-idUSKBN1D80BH?il=0

As Prime Minister Theresa May heads toward a 2019 EU divorce that will shape Britain’s prosperity and global influence for generations, her minority government has stumbled into several controversies that risk undermining her remaining authority.

In the latest misstep, Johnson came under pressure to retract remarks made on Nov. 1 that Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said Johnson’s comment was incorrect, while opposition British lawmakers said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail.

Johnson called Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday to discuss the case, and made clear that he had been seeking to make the point that he condemned the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, a spokesman said.

“The UK government has no doubt that she was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit,” Johnson told parliament.

“My point was that I disagreed with the Iranian view that training journalists was a crime, not that I wanted to lend any credence to Iranian allegations that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity,” he said.

“I accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and I am glad to provide this clarification.”

Johnson said he would travel to Iran in the coming weeks and discuss all consular issues there, and would try to meet Zaghari-Ratcliffe while there.

May’s spokesman expressed confidence in Johnson, adding that the “he was doing a good job”.

Monique Villa, Thomson Reuters Foundation CEO, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was a project manager in the media development team. Villa said Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not a journalist and had never trained journalists in Iran.

“We welcome UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson’s clarification of his comments,” Villa said. “It’s time now for the Foreign Secretary to meet Nazanin in jail.”

SHAMBOLIC GOVERNMENT?

Johnson is not the only one distracted.

At the weekend, May’s deputy, Damian Green, denied an allegation made in The Sunday Times newspaper that police found pornography on one of his computers in the Houses of Parliament in 2008.

On Monday, international development minister Priti Patel apologized for failing to disclose meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday.

Besides her government’s sometimes contradictory signals on Brexit, May has faced criticism from opponents for her handling of other issues: from a deadly apartment block fire in June to a sexual harassment scandal in parliament that prompted Michael Fallon, her loyal defense secretary, to resign.

“In my lifetime, I have never experienced a British government which seems to be so shambolic,” said Simon Hix, a professor of political science at the London School of Economics.

“They are in the midst of one of the greatest challenges of the last 50 years – Brexit – and they have sexual harassment scandals in parliament, the Paradise Papers and then now on top of that the behavior of May’s ministers.”

On Tuesday, Johnson came under pressure from opponents to retract his comments about Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment.

She was brought again into court on Saturday, three days after Johnson’s remarks, and accused by a judge of “spreading propaganda against the regime”.

The British Foreign Office quoted Zarif as saying that Johnson’s comments had nothing to do with the weekend court appearance.

The charges against Zaghari-Ratcliffe were denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Reuters News.

Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”

“Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit.

Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations.

Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.”

He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.”

The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

“The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region.

‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’

In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance.

While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures.

During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul.

He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed.

The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official.

Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added.

Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday.

Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said.

While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions.

‘GRAVE DANGER’

Slideshow (16 Images)

During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”

However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach.

North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving.

“North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.

He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader.

Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.”

The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said.

A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.

“The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One.

As Madrid began direct rule of Catalonia, Attorney General Jose Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition, fraud and misuse of funds to be brought against Catalan leaders who organized an illegal referendum on independence from Spain.

The Oct. 1 vote in the prosperous region with its own language and culture has triggered Spain’s biggest crisis in decades. On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed Catalonia’s secessionist government, called a regional election for Dec. 21 and said the central government would take direct control.

That process began smoothly on Monday as employees ignored calls for civil disobedience and turned up for work, while secessionist parties agreed to stand in the December poll.

A senior Spanish government official said on Monday that Puigdemont had traveled to Belgium. He drove to the French city of Marseilles to catch a flight to Belgium with five other members of his sacked administration, Spanish media reported.

Belgian lawyer Paul Bekaert, whose website says he is involved in a human rights organization, said he had taken on Puigdemont as a client but would not confirm whether he was working with him on a political asylum claim.

“I can confirm Carles Puigdemont has appointed me as his legal representative, as he is currently in Belgium,” Bekaert told Reuters. “At the moment there are no specific dossiers I am preparing for him.”

Bekaert told Belgian broadcaster VTM that Puigdemont had not fled Catalonia, was not hiding and would make a public appearance in Brussels on Tuesday.

After what he described as an hour-long meeting in his office in western Belgium, the lawyer - who quoted his experience with asylum and extradition cases, as well as with Spain - said his client was in high spirits, driven by “strong support among his backers in Catalonia”.

‘THINGS HAVE TO CARRY ON’

Some of the most prominent ousted Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont and Vice President Oriol Junqueras, had said they would not accept their dismissal.

But their respective parties, PdeCat and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, said on Monday they would take part in the election called by Rajoy, a tacit acceptance of direct rule from Madrid. The regional parliament canceled a meeting for Tuesday, another signal lawmakers accepted they had been dismissed.

A call for widespread civil disobedience from the main civic groups behind the secessionist campaign failed to attract many followers. Public-sector workers such as teachers, firefighters and the police mostly started work as normal on Monday and there was no sign of widespread absenteeism.

A trade union, Intersindical-CSC, which had called for a general strike in Catalonia, said on Monday it had canceled it.

Other regional leaders did not turn up to their offices, although some of their staff did.

One of 140 senior officials appointed directly by the outgoing government described the situation as “normal” and said he had not yet received any letter of dismissal.

“We civil servants want everything to be normal. Things have to carry on. The day-to-day work still has to be done,” he said.

Some 200,000 public-sector workers receive salaries paid by the Catalan region, and 100,000 others in the region rely directly on the Madrid government.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a unified Spain marched on Sunday in one of the biggest shows of force yet by the so-called silent majority that has watched as regional political leaders push for Catalan independence.

WORSENED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Two opinion polls showed support for independence may have started to wane. A Sigma Dos survey published in El Mundo showed 33.5 percent of Catalans were in favor of independence, while a Metroscopia poll published by El Pais put that number at 29 percent. That compared with 41.1 percent in July, according to an official survey carried out by the Catalan government.

Opponents of secession largely boycotted the Oct. 1 referendum, when participants voted overwhelmingly for independence on a turnout of 43 percent.

Spain’s interior ministry named a new chief for the regional police on Saturday, who has insisted that the 17,000 officers of the force should remain neutral.

The force has already withdrawn protection for dismissed regional government members, who were also left without their official cars. Their portraits were removed from the walls of public buildings.

The government’s move to impose direct rule received the backing of several influential Catalan business lobbies, which called on firms to stay in the region. The chaos has prompted an exodus of businesses from Catalonia, which contributes about a fifth of Spain’s economy, the euro zone’s fourth-largest.

Credit ratings agency Fitch said on Monday the escalation of tensions in Catalonia significantly worsened the outlook for Spain’s economic growth and could prompt negative action on the country’s rating.",Spanish prosecutor accuses sacked Catalan leader of rebellion,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-catalonia/spanish-prosecutor-accuses-sacked-catalan-leader-of-rebellion-idUSKBN1CZ0IP

The FTSE 100 .FTSE index was flat in percentage terms at 7,511.36 points by 1001 GMT, while mid caps .FTMC retreated 0.1 percent.

More broadly, gains in big, defensive stocks such as Imperial Brands (IMB.L) and British American Tobacco (BATS.L), added the most gains to the index, while gains among oil stocks BP (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) also helped.

Paper and packaging firm Mondi (MNDI.L) was among the biggest gainers, up 1.6 percent after Morgan Stanley moved its rating on the firm to “overweight” from “equal weight”.

A number of disappointing updates weighed on individual firms, however. Shares in housebuilder Persimmon (PSN.L) fell 3.4 percent, the worst-performing on the FTSE 100, after it issued a trading statement.

Shares in Marks & Spencer fell 0.7 percent after reporting results, which included another profit fall.

Grocer Marks & Spencer also said that it would accelerate its turnaround plan, and would open fewer Simply Food stores than previously planned.

“You’ve got a slightly weaker UK consumer possibly coming through in one or two of the retailers’ results,” George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said, adding that upcoming results from Halfords (HFD.L) and Sainsbury (SBRY.L) would shed more light on this theme.

Shares in utility SSE (SSE.L) nudged 0.7 percent higher after agreeing to merge its UK retail activities with German energy group Innogy (IGY.DE).

SSE also reported half-year figures, which included an 8 percent drop in profit due to weakness in its networks business.

Some analysts were cautious about the merger announcement.

“Although the idea of a spin-off is understandable, we highlight that both businesses vary significantly in outlook and the industry’s track record in integrating service and billing systems is poor,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.

“The move could also result in a rebasing of SSE’s dividend and impairment for Innogy.”

Outside of large caps, Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) dropped 7.7 percent after reporting results, with the focus on concerns over ticket pricing trends.

Wizz Air’s CEO also said that it was interested in acquiring airport slots at London Luton from failed airline Monarch.","FTSE falters as M&S, Persimmon updates disappoint",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-stocks/ftse-falters-as-ms-persimmon-updates-disappoint-idUKKBN1D814I

Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.”

“Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit.

Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations.

Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.”

He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do.

“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.”

The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.

“The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region.

‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’

In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance.

While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures.

During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul.

He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed.

The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official.

Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added.

Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday.

Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties.

“To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said.

While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more.

China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions.

‘GRAVE DANGER’

Slideshow (16 Images)

During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

“The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.”

However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach.

North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving.

“North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.

He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader.

Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.”

The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said.

A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea.

Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub.

And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official.

“The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One.

But the heart of European innovation isn’t a major metropolis –it’s a small city in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders. That’s the conclusion of Reuters’ second annual ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, a list that identifies and ranks the educational institutions doing the most to advance science, invent new technologies, and help drive the global economy (Compare all 100 schools here).

The library of the university KU Leuven ""Katholieke Universiteit Leuven"" is pictured in Leuven, Belgium, June 8, 2016. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir

REUTERS TOP 100

The most innovative university in Europe, for the second year running, is Belgium’s KU Leuven. This nearly 600-year-old institution was founded by Pope Martin V, but today it’s better known for technology than theology: KU Leuven maintains one of the largest independent research and development organizations on the planet. In fiscal 2015, the university’s research spending exceeded €454 million, and its patent portfolio currently includes 586 active families, each one representing an invention protected in multiple countries.

How does a relatively small Catholic university out-innovate bigger, better-known institutions across Europe? KU Leuven earned its first-place rank, in part, by producing a high volume of influential inventions. Its researchers submit more patents than most other universities on the continent, and outside researchers frequently cite KU Leuven inventions in their own patent applications. Those are key criteria in Reuters ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, which was compiled in partnership with Clarivate Analytics, and is based on proprietary data and analysis of indicators including patent filings and research paper citations.

The second most innovative university in Europe is Imperial College London, an institution whose researchers have been responsible for the discovery of penicillin, the development of holography and the invention of fiber optics. The third-place University of Cambridge has been associated with 91 Nobel Laureates during its 800-year history. And the fourth-place Technical University of Munich has spun off more than 800 companies since 1990, including a variety of high-tech startups in industries including renewable energy, semiconductors and nanotechnology.

Overall, the same countries that dominate European business and politics dominate the ranking of Europe’s Most Innovative Universities. German universities account for 23 of the 100 institutions on the list, more than any other country, and the United Kingdom comes in second, tied with France, each with 17 institutions. But those three countries are also among the most populous and richest countries on the continent. Control for those factors, and it turns out that countries with much smaller populations and modest economies often outperform big ones.

The Republic of Ireland has only three schools on the entire list, but with a population of less than 5 million people, it can boast more top 100 innovative universities per capita than any other country in Europe. On the same per capita basis, the second most innovative country on the list is Denmark, followed by Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Germany, the United Kingdom and France rank in the middle of the pack, an indication that they may be underperforming compared with their smaller neighbors: On a per capita basis, none of those countries has half as many top 100 universities than Ireland.

Students walk out of a faculty building of Imperial College London, Britain, May 27, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo

And the same trends hold true if you look at national economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2016 Germany’s gross domestic product exceeded $3.49 trillion –11 times larger than Ireland at $307 billion, yet Germany has only 7 times as many top 100 innovative universities.

Some countries underperform even more drastically. Russia is Europe’s most populous country and has the region’s fifth largest economy, yet none of its universities count among the top 100. Other notable absences include any universities from Ukraine or Romania–a fact that reveals another divide between Western and Eastern Europe.

To compile the ranking of Europe’s most innovative universities, Clarivate Analytics (formerly the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters) began by identifying more than 600 global organizations that published the most articles in academic journals, including educational institutions, nonprofit charities, and government-funded institutions. That list was reduced to institutions that filed at least 50 patents with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the period between 2010 and 2015. Then they evaluated each candidate on 10 different metrics, focusing on academic papers (which indicate basic research) and patent filings (which point to an institution’s ability to apply research and commercialize its discoveries). Finally, they trimmed the list so that it only included European universities, and then ranked them based on their performance.

This is the second consecutive year that Clarivate and Reuters have collaborated to rank Europe’s Most Innovative Universities, and three universities that ranked in the top 100 in 2016 fell off the list entirely: the Netherland’s Eindhoven University of Technology, Germany’s University of Kiel, and the UK’s Queens University Belfast. All three universities filed fewer than 50 patents during the period examined for the ranking, and thus were eliminated from consideration. They’ve been replaced by three new entrants to the top 100: the University of Glasgow (#54), the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (#94), and the Autonomous University of Madrid (#100).

The returning universities that made the biggest moves on the list were the Netherland’s Leiden University (up 21 spots to #17) and Germany’s Technical University of Berlin (up 21 spots to #41). Belgium’s Université Libre of Brussels (down 17 to #38) and the UK’s University of Leeds (down 17 to #73) made the biggest moves in the opposite direction. Generally, though, the list remained largely stable: Nine of the top ten schools of 2016 remained in the top 10 for 2017, and 17 of the top 20. This stability is understandable because something as large as university paper output and patent performance is unlikely to change quickly.

Of course, the relative ranking of any university does not provide a complete picture of whether its researchers are doing important, innovative work. Since the ranking measures innovation on an institutional level, it may overlook particularly innovative departments or programs: a university might rank low for overall innovation but still operate one of the world’s most innovative computer science laboratories, for instance. And it’s important to remember that whether a university ranks at the top or the bottom of the list, it’s still within the top 100 on the continent: All of these universities produce original research, create useful technology and stimulate the global economy.

He failed to accomplish either.

The dust was barely settling on the capture of Islamic State’s de facto capital Raqqa, a major success for Washington and the coalition it assembled across the region and beyond. While most of the actual fighting has been done by local forces, without U.S. support the Islamist group would still almost certainly dominate huge swathes of the region. Its dramatic early victories in 2014 seriously rattled authorities in Baghdad and Riyadh in particular – but now that it is largely on the ropes, neither government has much appetite for being dictated to by America.

Those in the Trump and Obama administration might be loathe to admit it, but over the last three years both followed a similar approach on Middle East policy. Occasionally dubbed “ISIS first,” it prioritized the group’s defeat above all other regional interests. It was a reasonable approach, and – while remnants of IS remain – it has proved remarkably successful.

The problem is that there is little clarity on what will now define U.S. Mideast policy. Without a single guiding principle, there is the real risk that an already-conflicted approach could fall apart entirely.

In some respects, this is already happening. With the diminished threat from IS, Washington’s always awkward alliance with the Shi’ite-dominated, Iran-allied Baghdad government and the various political entities of Iraqi Kurdistan has deteriorated with dramatic speed. A Kurdish independence referendum last month was followed quickly by an Iraqi government advance into oil-rich areas around the Kurdish city of Kirkuk. For much of the last week, Kurdish and Iraqi government forces – both U.S.-funded and equipped, and until recently allies in the bloody battle for Mosul – have been at each other’s throats.

Across the rest of the region, the historical Sunni-Shi’ite rivalry continues to grow more complex. In Syria, Iran and Russia have essentially succeeded in their attempts to salvage Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Washington appears to have accepted this as the cost of stability and pushing back against Islamic State, while giving Saudi Arabia effective carte blanche to pursue its own war in Yemen against Houthi rebels allied with Tehran.

With IS weakened, the Trump White House clearly now hopes to make the confrontation with Iran its overarching regional priority. Trump’s October 13 announcement that he would not recertify the nuclear deal negotiated by the previous administration was the clearest signal of that so far, followed closely by new sanctions against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, which the U.S. labels a sponsor of terror.

On Iran, however, Washington has little realistic chance of achieving the wide, unified coalition it formed against IS. America’s allies remain deeply divided on the best approach to Tehran, with European states openly reluctant to tear up the nuclear agreement also signed by Moscow and Beijing.

The Gulf states are anything but a unified coalition. The Saudi and United Arab Emirates-backed blockade of Qatar continues, putting the United States – which has major military bases in all three countries – in an awkward position, one it appears to have extremely limited ability to remedy.

The face-off between Qatar and neighbors long-infuriated by its support for groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood may now be beyond Washington’s ability to resolve. If anything, however, Tillerson was even less likely to achieve his other objective for the visit, that of turning the Iraqi government against Tehran.

When it comes to defeating Islamic State, Baghdad has been at least as dependent on Iran-backed Shi’ite militias as on Washington or the Kurds. Tillerson’s demand this weekend that those militias return to Iran will have been seen as particularly unreasonable – not least because many of their members are Shi’ite Iraqi nationals.

Tillerson’s visit risks reinforcing a narrative that had been growing in strength since the Obama administration – that America has ever-less control and influence over traditional friends and enemies alike, particularly at a time when they increasingly feel they can turn to alternatives such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey – a reliable U.S. ally as far back as the end of the nineteenth century – has become increasingly hostile. Egypt’s military government too is increasingly keen to assert its independence, even as it continues to receive large quantities of U.S. aid.

Peter Van Buren: What you need to know about post-IS battle for Mideast

Maysam Behravesh: The unlikely - and ironic - effects of Islamic State's fall in Iraq

Relations with Israel might be marginally better under Trump than Obama but they remain much looser than in recent decades. Trump has sent mixed signals on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; suggested – but not acted upon – moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and unsettled Israelis after reports that he disclosed Israeli-provided classified information about Islamic State to Russia’s foreign minister earlier this year. Israel’s concerns about Iran’s rising influence and an unpredictable U.S. administration make it likely that the Jewish state will intensify its own efforts at regional diplomacy, particularly with the Gulf states.

It’s a paradox that this is happening at the same time as the largely successful coalition effort against Islamic State – a coalition that depended heavily on the United States, and which perhaps no other country could have ushered into existence in quite the same way. In contrast to the unilateral U.S. military intervention in Iraq, Washington went to great efforts to work with and through regional partners, and it has proved remarkably effective. (The irony isn’t confined to the Middle East. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is celebrating a U.S.-assisted victory over IS in Marawi City at the same time that he intensifies his courtship of Russia and China.)

U.S. military assistance will remain. IS is not completely gone, and will continue to lash out. It may yet seize new safe havens as it has in parts of Libya and Afghanistan. The wider battle against al Qaeda-inspired militancy will unquestionably continue, often with U.S. military support and coordination.

After more than a decade of war and perceived failure, however, America’s enthusiasm for attempting to reshape the Middle East may be running out. But even if it isn’t, the willingness of those in the region to listen may also be exhausted.

World number one Rafael Nadal, who is hoping to recover from a knee injury to play in the season-ending showpiece, heads the other group and will face Belgian David Goffin, Bulgarian debutant Grigor Dimitrov and Austrian Dominic Thiem.

Also in the Pete Sampras group with Federer is Croatian Marin Cilic, the man he beat in this year’s Wimbledon final, and American Jack Sock who crept into the tournament after winning the Paris Masters.

Zverev, 20, has taken men’s tennis by storm this year, rocketing up to number three in the world rankings after winning five titles, including two Masters 1000 events.

“It’s an honour to play there in London, it’s my first time and hopefully not my last,” Zverev said in Milan where he took part in an exhibition match at the Next Gen Finals, having dropped out to concentrate on London.

“I will try to prepare myself as well as I can and try to win many matches there.”

He is one of three first-timers with Dimitrov finally qualifying after being long-predicted to become a regular member of the men’s elite. Sock is the first American to qualify since Mardy Fish did so in 2011.

Goffin has qualified for the first time also, although last year he played a match as an alternate.

The draw, which took place on BBC Radio, was delayed because Boris Becker, who Nadal’s group is named after, was held up by traffic on his way to the studio.

Several big names are missing this year through injury including 2016 winner Andy Murray, four-times London winner Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka.

Islamic State has been all but destroyed over the past two years, remaining only in Albu Kamal in Syria, Rawa in Iraq, in a few neighboring villages and patches of desert, and some isolated pockets elsewhere.

At the height of its power in 2015, it ruled over an expanse of the two countries, eradicating their border, printing money, imposing draconian laws and plotting attacks across the world.

On Wednesday, the army and its allies surrounded Albu Kamal and started to enter it, the pro-Hezbollah al-Manar television said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, reported that Iraqi militias had crossed into Syria to join the assault, but they denied it.

Despite its losses, Islamic State still has a territorial presence in Libya and elsewhere, and many governments expect it to remain a threat even after it loses the caliphate it declared from Mosul, Iraq, in 2014.

It has already carried out a series of guerrilla operations in both Iraq and in Syria, and it has continued to inspire lone militants to attack civilian targets in the West.

In Syria, the end of major battle operations against Islamic State may only prefigure a new phase of the war, as the rival forces which have seized territory from the jihadists square off.

The Syrian army, alongside its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and other Shi‘ite militias, and backed by Iran and Russia, have seized swathes of central and eastern Syria in an advance against Islamic State this year.

Russian official media have in recent weeks reported a surge of strategic bombing and cruise missile strikes on Islamic State targets in eastern Syria as the army advanced.

A U.S.-backed coalition has supported a rival campaign in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that have pushed Islamic State from much of the country’s north and east.

NEW PHASE

The Syrian government has sworn to recapture territory held by the SDF, including Islamic State’s former capital Raqqa and oil and gas fields lying east of the Euphrates.

In areas controlled by the SDF in northern Syria, Kurdish-led groups have established autonomy, announcing elections and setting internal policies.

On Tuesday, Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, described the U.S. forces aiding the SDF in Syria as illegal invaders. Washington has not spelled out how its military support for the SDF would evolve after Islamic State’s defeat.

Shaaban also pointed, in a television interview, to the example of Iraq, where the government retaliated against an autonomous Kurdish region after it held an independence referendum.

Iraqi military officials say small groups of Islamic State militants are still entrenched in the town of Rawa and the border desert strip with Syria. Scattered villages near al-Qaim, close to Albu Kamal, are still under militant control in an area called Rummana.

The Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an alliance of militias, denied a report by the Observatory that it had crossed the Syrian border and was attacking Albu Kamal.

“Our movements are carried out under orders from the commander in chief of the armed forces and our key objective is to liberate Iraq’s territories from Daesh. We have no orders to cross the borders,” PMF spokesman Ahmed al-Asadi said.",Syrian army starts assault on last IS stronghold,https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-islamic-state/syrian-army-starts-assault-on-last-is-stronghold-idINKBN1D81NG?il=0

Protesters shut down roads, causing huge tailbacks into Barcelona, and some public transport ran minimum services in response to calls for action by two civic groups -- whose heads were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- and a labor union.

People stood across dozens of major highways in the region waving placards and chanting “freedom for political prisoners”, TV and video images showed, while minor scuffles were reported on social media as police attempted to move protesters.

While many smaller stores left their shutters closed, most larger shops and businesses in the region appeared to be open as normal.

An uphill task awaited the political heavyweights of the independence campaign, whose parties jointly ran Catalonia for the last two years until Madrid sacked the region’s government in response to its independence push.

Deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont’s center-right PDeCAT and the leftist ERC of former regional vice president Oriol Junqueras had until midnight on Tuesday to agree a new pact, but they failed to meet that deadline, meaning they will contest the Dec. 21 vote as separate parties.

The central government in Madrid called the election last month after assuming control of Catalonia following its parliament’s unilateral independence declaration.

Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, while Junqueras is in custody on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds.

‘JUNCKER WON‘T MEET ME’

Puigdemont, who faces the same charges and is the subject of a extradition request from Madrid, had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heartland of the European Union.

But that hope has fallen flat, and in an interview published on Wednesday he renewed criticism of the bloc’s executive.

“(EU Commission President Jean-Claude) Juncker welcomes mayors, governors ... but he doesn’t want to meet me,” Puigdemont told Belgian Daily De Standaard.

“I’ve always been a convinced European ... But the people who are running the EU now, are wrecking Europe ... The gap between the Europe of the people and the official Europe is increasing.”

Catalonia’s secessionist push has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in four decades, triggered a business exodus and reopened old wounds from the country’s civil war in the 1930s.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has been unwavering in his opposition to any form of independence for Catalonia, said he hoped next month’s election would usher in “a period of calm” and business as usual for the region.

Slideshow (7 Images)

“I‘m hoping for massive participation in the election.. and, after that, we’ll return to normality,” he said in the Madrid parliament building on Wednesday.

An opinion poll released on Sunday by Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia showed Junqueras’ ERC could garner between 45 and 46 seats in Catalonia’s 135-strong regional assembly while Puigdemont’s PdeCat would win just 14 or 15.

In order to reach the 68-seat threshold for a majority, they would then have to form a parliamentary alliance with anti-capitalist CUP.

ERC and PDeCAT could still reach an agreement after the vote, but by standing together they could have held more seats, polls and projections from the 2015 election results showed.

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a banking conference in Madrid he hoped the election would revive the Catalan success story “during which it has enjoyed great economic and cultural prosperity together with a high level of self-governance.”

For some Catalans who ignored Wednesday’s strike -- called by the CSC union and supported by civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural -- that moment is already overdue.

“Why should I strike, nobody is going to raise my salary. In this world we have to work and not argue so much,” Jose Luis, a construction worker, told Reuters TV as he walked through Barcelona on his way to work.

Thick smog swathed Delhi, where pollution readings in some places peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government’s air quality index that measures poisonous particles.

“The air quality in Delhi is deteriorating. We cannot compromise with the health of children at this stage,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, ordering the closure until Sunday.

The Delhi administration, which described the city as a “gas chamber”, had previously ordered schools for young children to close only for Wednesday.

India’s federal health ministry also advised people with breathing problems and children to remain indoors.

“People should avoid morning walk or any other strenuous outdoor activity that increases breathing rate,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

Anti-pollution measures adopted by the Delhi state government in recent years include limiting car use and taxing trucks that pass through the city, but few have succeeded.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s federal government also urged Delhi and the surrounding northern states to immediately tackle dangerous levels of pollution in the capital, even if that meant deploying helicopters to spray jets of water.

“Every possible step required to tackle the situation has been already identified, and the need of the hour is to put them into action,” federal Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan wrote on social network Twitter, using the hashtag “#DelhiSmog”.

Vardhan also urged the surrounding states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to ban burning on farms, which is seen as a major contributor to the dirty air, along with high vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites.

EMERGENCY MEASURES

The Delhi government said it had sought meetings with state ministers to discuss the burning, provoking protest from many who saw the measure as being too little and too late.

“Nobody seems to get the gravity of the problem,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, the chairman and managing director of the Medanta Heart Institute.

Last November, the city’s worst pollution in nearly 20 years forced about a million children to miss school, while thousands of workers reported sick and people queued to buy face masks.

Residents are worried this year as well. The Indian Medical Association has urged organizers to call off Delhi’s biggest race set for Nov. 19, to protect runners and volunteers.

If pollution increases, emergency measures, such as the suspension of construction activity, will kick in, the Delhi government has said.

Long-term measures, such as improving public transport and banning the use of dirty industry fuel, are required, said Anumita Roychowdhury of New Delhi’s Centre for Science and Environment.

“Without the systemic changes, the scope and impact of the emergency measures will be limited,” she added.

The thick blanket of smog caused a major vehicle pile-up on a busy highway on the outskirts of Delhi, Indian media reported.

High pollution levels were driving a major surge for air purifiers in capital New Delhi and its suburbs, Amazon.com Inc’s India unit said.

Air purifier sales have surged 150 percent, along with a 260 percent increase in demand for face masks this year, Amazon said, adding that air purifier sales have risen 600 percent in the last month.","Delhi schools shut for rest of week as toxic smog thickens, chokes",https://www.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/delhi-schools-shut-for-rest-of-week-as-toxic-smog-thickens-chokes-idINKBN1D80ZG?il=0
